0,tt0012349,While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplins later features The Kid is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicelyWhile its a fairly simple story this is one of Chaplins most efficiently designed movies  Every scene either is necessary to the plot or is very funny for its own sake or both  Except for Chaplin and Coogan most of the other characters even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance are just there to advance the plot when needed and the two leads are allowed to carry the show which they both do extremely wellThe Kid is also impressive in that while the story is a sentimental one it strikes an ideal balance maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies  Here the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorableThis is one of Chaplins very best movies by any measure  If you enjoy silent comedies dont miss it,0
1,tt0012349,Ive always thought theres a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies even unsentimental ones like Keatons The General or Laurel and Hardys Way Out West The latter comedy has a scene where L&amp;H perform a softshoe dance; it always brings me to tears Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that Im laughing doesnt dilute the emotional chargeOne of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already Why not marry the two things? Thats what he did in some of his early short films and thats what he does in this feature comedy The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie Jackie Coogan away Meanwhile the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesnt know if shell ever find out what became of himJackie Coogan about five in this film with his charming manners his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy is one of the alltime great child actors Want more evidence of Chaplins genius? Coogan doesnt steal the film from him This is true even though Chaplin as producer star and director makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boys talents Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles like My Boy and Oliver TwistChaplins storytelling—even with the foolish subDickensian plot twists such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed The windowbreaking scene the flophouse scene the dream sequence the tryingtogetridofthebaby scene—theyre perfect Chaplins celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselvesWant me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know I cant even complain about that Its too sweetly naïve And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the very few flawsOne important note children love this movie Show it to them while theyre young and youll make Chaplin fans of them And thats better than their becoming fans of almost anything thats being peddled to them,0
2,tt0012349,Wow is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so That fact that it still entertains over  years after it was made is quite a testimony It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama Charlie Chaplins unique humor combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember Chaplins humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stuntsThe kid  Jackie Coogan  is just as memorable maybe even more so He is unbelievably cute especially in those oldtime clothes he wore Watching the expressions on his face even as a baby are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent eraSo between Chaplin and Coogan and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next its an amazing piece of work This is a very fastpaced story which lasts less than an hourThe special edition twodisc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear actually astounding for its age Excellent entertainment,9
3,tt0012349,THE KID First National Pictures  a comedydrama written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  plays an important part his screen career Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIES PUNCTURED ROMANCE  a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies but releases coming once every two to three years A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in  eventually under the supervision and direction of himself Chaplins methods in movie making improved with each passing film Like himself Jackie Coogan Chaplins littlest costar and title character made such an impression with his initial performance nearly upstaging his impresario that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own becoming Hollywoods first important child starTHE KID starts off with intertitles A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear followed by The woman whose sin was motherhood titles much to the liking of a DW Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish yet in fact might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplins whose very name personifies comedy A young girl Edna Purviance leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father Carl Miller a young artist never returns to her life The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away Crooks enter the scene stealing the car discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else but after stumbling upon a note which reads Please love and care for this orphan child he decides to raise the child himself Five years pass The kid whose name is believed to be John now Charlies adopted son and sidekick start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money As for the kids mother shes become a star of great prominence devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts where lives the kid The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions unaware of each others identities When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention a middleaged country doctor having discovered Charlie not the boys true father sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child awayTHE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product especially for a silent movie made so long ago Chaplin who constructs his gags to perfection has one difficult scene that comes off naturally this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as hes lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot a substitute for a baby bottle back into his mouth Another classic moment on a serious nature is when Charlie is being held back by authorities being forced to watch his crying son taken away from him Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as hes being chased by a policeman from the slanted rooftops The closeup where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on filmChaplin and little Jackie billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin right down to his baggy pants Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances is so convincing that it doesnt take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp From this point onward he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor at the same time adding more plot pathos and truly great comedy routinesAs much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that followsTHE KID which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years was resurrected in the s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in  It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in  as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection double billed along with a comedy short THE IDLE CLASS  In the DVD format the two disc set includes rare outtakes and deleted scenes Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library where it made its debut December   during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights hosted by Robert Osborne and later in March  when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its Star of the MonthFor its age THE KID holds up extremely well thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan Theres no doubt Jackie Coogan  became an overnight star with this one film He was a natural While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again on screen anyway without them there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID ****,10
4,tt0012349,The Kid is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplins oeuvre Chaplin hadnt filled a film so fully with pathos since The Vagabond  and then it was in a very limited way subject to the confines of tworeel length Additionally Sunnyside  was a failure The feature length of The Kid also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags pranks and set pieces and with the support of Jackie Coogan its one of his funniest comediesThe parentchild relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment and for me not many have neared Chaplin in exploiting that formula in The Kid The sequence where they take the kid for a workhouse away from the tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the filmor of all film In addition to Chaplin and Coogan Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture Furthermore Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totherohs photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist but the musical score added to the  release composed by Chaplin taken from Tchaikovsky gives the sentimental parts its most verveOf the slapstick one of my favorite scenes involves the tramp in fear of a bully Its reminiscent of his Mutual short Easy Street  which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film Yet The Kid is much more than that which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplins previous work This was the beginning of the tramp as the sympathetic pitiful hero as well as clown thats so recognizable and beloved to this dayMoreover the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect Its also funny in a silly way Its somewhat analogous to the outer reality story although with much ambiguity I wasnt always sure Chaplin was making any clear point such as with the Christ image earlier in the film but that seems unimportant; The Kid affects the emotions and isnt especially aimed at engaging the mind At six reels with more sets and a developed plot this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplins previous films; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth thus making The Kid Chaplins first complete feature,9
5,tt0012349,It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as The Kid It is a silent movie but so rich winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words Chaplin and year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness And I really never cry in movies And the musicits simply Oscarlevel! The movie is sympathetic full of feeling touchingly funny moments It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over  years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age don´t miss it,10
6,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous His character the Tramp is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early th century but something all of us can overcomeIn one of his first roles with this character he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family Taking himself and this very talented young boy Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote directed starred in and composed the score for this filmHere Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own He hasnt got much but he does have love which is more than can be said for the childs motherFlash forward five years and now the mother wants her son back Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion Even so the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks things not used much at the time in the movies Using these little tricks and ideas Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the storyHowever at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh sometimes in the same scene This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it,8

8,tt0012349,Its easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius but Ill say it once again the man was a genius if only at doing a certain particular kind of film You wouldnt ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film or at least one like out of Germany or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the s and s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and the usual kickedaround word manipulated amid the comedic setups Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the KidAs it stands even at  minutes which was trimmed by Chaplin himself  years after its original release and including a new musical score its just about a perfectly told tale It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that Dreamland sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful lightanddark examination of all the major characters in the picture now with angel wings and devil horns! What its about in complete basics is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she wont be able to take care of him and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at and the Tramp decides to take care of him he even names him in one amusing aside John Then it cuts to  years later and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows eat lots of pancake and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an Older Brother of a kid John gets in a fight with Meanwhile the mother is now a success not knowing her child is somewhere right in front of her noseThis may sound like a bit of story but its told briskly and without a missed beat in editing and Chaplins reedit tightens it to a point where were mostly with the Kid and the Tramp Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be playful absurd cute and bittersweet to a degree We know this cant exactly last but the moment the poor maybesick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic and yet partially triumphant sequences in the movies Its in a case like this where we as the audience tear up more or less as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out and then intercut with Chaplins daring dash across the rooftops to save him that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film silent or otherwise; that its silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true even a beat with the Kid playing with toys an obviously cute bit is great and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like ChaplinFeaturing some excellent setpieces just unto themselves aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that bellylaugh part with the repetitive brickhit to the head or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin and excellent performances from all supporting cast including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance its altogether an aweinspiring feat To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness,10
9,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid the cute little Jackie Coogan has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos and true to what you would expect of his best work does it superbly  The tramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding a little boy to the mix was the finishing touch  Look out too for little Lita Grey in the angel sequence who would become Chaplins nd wife four years after this film was made,0
10,tt0012349,What makes a feature film different to a short? It isnt just length After all some of Charlie Chaplins later shorts were as long as fortyfive minutes while The Kid is barely an hour No when Chaplin made his graduation to fulllength features he also strove to broaden the scope scale and above all the dignity of his work The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplins careerThe Kid begins with a bit of backstory as a few of Chaplins shorts do but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this Here we have the opening of a drama and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief Of course such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short but here that wouldnt be appropriate Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laughoutloud funny but they certainly dont belong in a straight dramatic setting And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room sceneAnd never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration but still very natural by the standards of the time And of course little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive his movements expressions and timings all spoton so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness and he appears more like a human cartoon character Coogan steals the picture with ease and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously asideThis too is an important difference with The Kid Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act famously severing his partnership with the funnyinhisownright Ben Turpin back in  Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own The few examples such as the routine with the policemans wife and the window ledge are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material However he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this outToday The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful featurelength spinoff If you look at something like the minute Christmas special of The Office it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode Chaplins full length features however were far more than just spinoffs and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work,9
11,tt0012349,The Kid became a critically hailed international hit A tramp Charles Chaplin brings up an abandoned baby Jackie Coogan and later loses him to his mother Edna Purviance; but there is a happy endingThe film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums The comedy is sparingly laid on but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest The production is comparatively smooth young Coogan is sensational and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced His inspiration it is suggested was the death of his own first son Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in ,10
12,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins first full length feature film and his biggest success up to that date is a remarkably heartwarming story  which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy It begins with a woman whos sin was motherhood who gives birth to a baby she cant support at a Charity Hospital which is kept padlocked from the inside She is forced to abandon it in an alley and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film as he is casually strolling by and then through a series of odd but entirely believable situations he is unable to get rid of it It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin who was in top form playing the little boy at  years old Charlies life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplins traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed dramatic story The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments sometimes simultaneously if you can believe that but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival and it is never once predictable all the way until the last frameThere is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy and in between rounds  Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well and giving him hints for the rest of the fight Meanwhile the other kids brother shows up a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankensteins monster than anything else What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street This is a slapstick setup that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time were it not for its direct relevance to the storyAt another point there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home as the  version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackies arms I think this is the only time in any film that Ive ever seen genuine lowbrow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident This combination not just here but throughout the film is The Kids biggest achievement There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about although my understanding is that volumes have been written about its symbolic meaning both within the movie and in reference to Chaplins personal life And speaking of which supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing I dont know which story to believe that it was because of Chaplins painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary I would bet its a little of both but the film is here and I guess ultimately thats all that matters In the five or six times that Ive seen The Kid I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramps real son either on screen or off Then again I am looking at it with st century eyes Some of Shirley Temples early films are also a little disturbing to me although for not quite the same reasons By this time Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films and after  short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond along with a few assorted others Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema,10

14,tt0012349,The simple lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch Id say that it is as much funny as sad and the music score couldnt be more accuratePerhaps the most delightful surprise was to In the dreamland scene So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated the scene made me question myself if at the moment I was watching Buñuel and not Chaplin It is not my Chaplins favorite but its for sure one of his bests Totally recommend to be watched Chaplin will never disappoint you thats for sure If you watch this one also with City Lights and Modern Times youll be ready to enjoy his talkies The Great Dictator a classic and the perfect touching till tears Limelight,9
15,tt0012349,Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five yearsIn reading Charlie Chaplins memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him The second thing was Chaplins determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be doneThe success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they dont totally steal the film from youThe Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid Hes the same rapscallion Tramp we all know but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp one of deep feeling and protectiveness Two people who need and love each other very much This film couldnt missFirst National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin the studio and his estranged wife Mildred Harris The Robert Downey Jr biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itselfTill that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid,9
16,tt0012349,The Kid was released in  at the pinnacle of the Silent era when emotions came to screen through looks and body language when we didnt need dialog we had faces And if theres one film where Charlie Chaplins face oddly illuminates the screen its definitely The Kid Sure many fans would argue that City Lights is Chaplins masterpiece but something is too perfect too masterfully directed it was made during the talking era Chaplin was in his s and had more experience while The Kid features a more youthful director It belongs to a whole other era and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed in  Chaplin was  Hitchcock  Brando wasnt even born discovering The Kid is like turning the pages of a dusty yellowpaged historical book one eye is watching the film while the other discovers a period And I dont know if Im the only one but theres something in the setting the location that makes the film look even older For all I saw the movie could have been set in the early century and considering the timing of the film maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin himself The film was made in a difficult personal time when hed just lost his son after his birth There was a great wound in Chaplins heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragementThe context of The Kid is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time which is even more impressive considering his sevenyear experience a short time but enough to create an icon the Little Tramp an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema Chaplins story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and Im sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame  and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a filmmakerThe Emigrant in  was like the first step back into Chaplins past inspired by his own experience The movie doesnt feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future and leaving the motherland wasnt synonym of sadness but the emotions were there beyond the slapstick and the comedy and waiting for another step back to finally explode in an emotional firework which directly transports us to Chaplins past He who grew up without a father and started working at an early age he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living before it cemented his talent he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin And this is how The Kid was made and for the first time Chaplin would become more than a simple clown and get all the respect he needed from his peers as a gifted filmmaker He could finally make his first masterpiece The Gold Rush but The Kid was this necessary last breath before taking the big diveMany aspects of The Kid highlight Chaplins past and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs  a woman abandons a child expecting him to be adopted by a rich family until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramps arms But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who despite the archetypal situations didnt make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt as is the father a nicelooking fellow and a sign that Chaplin doesnt hold any grief against his father These things happen and we shouldnt feel sorry as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos  the Tramp and the KidIn every aspect the Kid is Chaplins alter ego  hes smart tender funny sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing Weve seen so many child performances since  to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is and Jackie Coogan is one of the best if not the best almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy and that the kid didnt become as much a star as Chaplin is one of cinemas cruelest ironies The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense closeups on Chaplins face  his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen and whatever inhabits the Tramps heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himselfChaplin like Disney for animation handled drama with the same strength as for comedy the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy fun cheers and even some dreamy escapism allowing a selfreflexive approach of the magic of childhood The Kid is not perfect but its a masterpiece of sincerity of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music If not his best its his most defining film ,9
17,tt0012349,This is such a incredible movieAlong with City Lights and The Gold Rush this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin and it is also one of the best movies ever madeIt is true that for the modern viewers the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the boxofficeThat doesnt mean this movie isnt entertaining In fact I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny comedies and also way more emotional and engagingI truly loved this film It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldnt be forgotten,10
18,tt0012349,The opening title to this film reads A film with a smile  and perhaps a tear Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken for Charlie Chaplins The Kid has a plethora of smiles from start to finish and yes a few tears as well The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character played by Chaplin The Tramp takes the baby into his own care Five years go by and the Tramp and the Kid portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan are getting along just fine However a turn of events results in the two being separated and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his sonCharlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking and this film is one of his best His direction is truly remarkable being able to manipulate the audiences emotions so much without sound He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget He manages to make you laugh almost nonstop from start to finish and even wind up causing you to shed a tear Its so emotionally gripping and you just fall in love with these characters from the getgo Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinemaAs emotionally wrenching this film is its simply hilarious This film has some great slapstick humor and Chaplin is a true master of it Jackie Coogan is also great If I had to find one flaw with the film it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I dont really mind it despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film Overall The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute then tug at your heartstrings the next Its an absolute riot but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema Ive ever seen And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue its just incredible And not to mention the music is just stellar too Chaplin is a master at composition The Kid is one of my favorite films and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!,10
19,tt0012349,When watching this I wanted to give the film a  rather than an  simply because I do not think it is as good as Modern Times or one or two others However taking into account that this is  and the film technology is not all there I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done it could have been made a decade later and looked the sameChaplin has to of course be given a lot of credit for producing writing directing and starring Being a great comic actor is one thing but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid and they nailed it  hes adorable emotional and seems able to handle any situation,8
20,tt0012349,The worlds most famous tramp is back and this time he has kid sidekick! Sounds kind of gimmicky right? But it works perfectly! Chaplin and child actor Jackie Coogan work extremely well together Their scenes are filled with heart and you can see that they both enjoyed themselves during the making of the movie The movie has the signature Chaplin slapstick that is guaranteed to have you in stitches but it also has some genuinely sad and emotional moments making this movie one of Chaplins most fondly remembered from his gigantic and legendary filmography,10
21,tt0012349,A tramp finds an abandoned kid on the street He tries to get rid of it in Charlie Chaplin way but ends up raising it with road side values Child becomes an apple of his eyes in a few years but the mother comes back to claim her son I had heard that this was the best movie Charlie Chaplin made but I disagree with that statement completely No doubt its a fantastic movie with a very strong story and message but its definitely not his best I found the last scene of the movie a little contrite and compromising The story has been adapted and tried in very many forms Extremely sensitive and though provoking cinema A must see for all,8
22,tt0012349,I was hardly a Chaplin fan in fact I loved Laurel &amp; Hardy and really didnt like Charlie Chaplin until I found that I could impersonate him as a lookalike  Then while viewing his films for the need of impersonating I have become a big Charlie Chaplin fan  His comedy mingled with pasos and pantomime was unique and very funny; and this one is certainly one of his bestIn it a sixyear old Jackie Coogan makes his screen debut as a little orphan that the tramp picks up and cares for five years  Every moment of this film is terrific it moves along swiftly and made me shed a tear three or few times  Chaplins score is undeniably a great piece of artwork and the acting is superb; nobody in this film lacksespecially ChaplinI recommend this film for all to see  Its age has not diminished this little love tale for a family in fact it makes you realize family love even more  Youll laugh cry and have a great time out  Rent it  Buy it View it  Its a film for all to see,0
23,tt0012349,They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but Im not so sure anymore There has been a generational discontinuity at least in the USA that seems to have happened about  or  years ago I suspect that most people over the age of  could identify Charlie Chaplin and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinctionGenerally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation but Jackie Coogan is an exceptionSentimental manipulation there is but its mainly limited to one or two scenes The comedy is pretty acerbic Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again Thats not what passes for sentimentalityBesides Coogan is cute when hes  or  years old a ragamuffin dressed in floppy oversized bags of clothing so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it And the kid can act tooCharlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him which was all he had to do Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because hes too inexperienced to know how to overact Chaplain is good too of course How could one person be so inventive? Its said that TV eats up talent because of the constant demand for new material One of the better series Twilight Zone had about three good years of collaborative effort in it Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in  films and directed something like  of them and he was just getting startedIll give one example of a joke without an iota of sentiment in it to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid a big bully who knocks him about Chaplain spots this interrupts the fight and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing  go for the belly keep your guard up  and sends him back into the fight At this point the bullys hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says If your boy beats my boy Im going to beat you Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bullys chin and flattens him But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back Chaplain dashes over puts his foot on the Coogans chest to hold him down quickly counts to ten rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand  the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy Youll enjoy it Especially if youre one of those rare folks under  with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue,0
24,tt0012349,A picture with a smile and perhaps a tearThat is the first line of the movie as it begins and it stands true We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling Wow I cant say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story Now we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally recent great movie is Finding Nemo But whats special about this movie is simplicty honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into usDone by the genius Chaplin there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling we either smile or bring tears So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do are done there Winning over a fight from a neighbour meeting angels and all Now look at the editing in this less than an hour film its neat and precise The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film Acting is sublime by Chaplin only few can do what he did and even today hardly anyone can match him Its a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch atlas watch it before you die you may learn something you never wanted to miss Its / for one of the finest silent movies ever,10
25,tt0012349,While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplins later features The Kid is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicelyWhile its a fairly simple story this is one of Chaplins most efficiently designed movies  Every scene either is necessary to the plot or is very funny for its own sake or both  Except for Chaplin and Coogan most of the other characters even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance are just there to advance the plot when needed and the two leads are allowed to carry the show which they both do extremely wellThe Kid is also impressive in that while the story is a sentimental one it strikes an ideal balance maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies  Here the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorableThis is one of Chaplins very best movies by any measure  If you enjoy silent comedies dont miss it,0
26,tt0012349,Ive always thought theres a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies even unsentimental ones like Keatons The General or Laurel and Hardys Way Out West The latter comedy has a scene where L&amp;H perform a softshoe dance; it always brings me to tears Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that Im laughing doesnt dilute the emotional chargeOne of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already Why not marry the two things? Thats what he did in some of his early short films and thats what he does in this feature comedy The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie Jackie Coogan away Meanwhile the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesnt know if shell ever find out what became of himJackie Coogan about five in this film with his charming manners his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy is one of the alltime great child actors Want more evidence of Chaplins genius? Coogan doesnt steal the film from him This is true even though Chaplin as producer star and director makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boys talents Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles like My Boy and Oliver TwistChaplins storytelling—even with the foolish subDickensian plot twists such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed The windowbreaking scene the flophouse scene the dream sequence the tryingtogetridofthebaby scene—theyre perfect Chaplins celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselvesWant me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know I cant even complain about that Its too sweetly naïve And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the very few flawsOne important note children love this movie Show it to them while theyre young and youll make Chaplin fans of them And thats better than their becoming fans of almost anything thats being peddled to them,0
27,tt0012349,Wow is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so That fact that it still entertains over  years after it was made is quite a testimony It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama Charlie Chaplins unique humor combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember Chaplins humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stuntsThe kid  Jackie Coogan  is just as memorable maybe even more so He is unbelievably cute especially in those oldtime clothes he wore Watching the expressions on his face even as a baby are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent eraSo between Chaplin and Coogan and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next its an amazing piece of work This is a very fastpaced story which lasts less than an hourThe special edition twodisc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear actually astounding for its age Excellent entertainment,9
28,tt0012349,THE KID First National Pictures  a comedydrama written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  plays an important part his screen career Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIES PUNCTURED ROMANCE  a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies but releases coming once every two to three years A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in  eventually under the supervision and direction of himself Chaplins methods in movie making improved with each passing film Like himself Jackie Coogan Chaplins littlest costar and title character made such an impression with his initial performance nearly upstaging his impresario that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own becoming Hollywoods first important child starTHE KID starts off with intertitles A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear followed by The woman whose sin was motherhood titles much to the liking of a DW Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish yet in fact might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplins whose very name personifies comedy A young girl Edna Purviance leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father Carl Miller a young artist never returns to her life The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away Crooks enter the scene stealing the car discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else but after stumbling upon a note which reads Please love and care for this orphan child he decides to raise the child himself Five years pass The kid whose name is believed to be John now Charlies adopted son and sidekick start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money As for the kids mother shes become a star of great prominence devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts where lives the kid The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions unaware of each others identities When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention a middleaged country doctor having discovered Charlie not the boys true father sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child awayTHE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product especially for a silent movie made so long ago Chaplin who constructs his gags to perfection has one difficult scene that comes off naturally this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as hes lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot a substitute for a baby bottle back into his mouth Another classic moment on a serious nature is when Charlie is being held back by authorities being forced to watch his crying son taken away from him Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as hes being chased by a policeman from the slanted rooftops The closeup where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on filmChaplin and little Jackie billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin right down to his baggy pants Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances is so convincing that it doesnt take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp From this point onward he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor at the same time adding more plot pathos and truly great comedy routinesAs much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that followsTHE KID which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years was resurrected in the s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in  It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in  as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection double billed along with a comedy short THE IDLE CLASS  In the DVD format the two disc set includes rare outtakes and deleted scenes Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library where it made its debut December   during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights hosted by Robert Osborne and later in March  when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its Star of the MonthFor its age THE KID holds up extremely well thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan Theres no doubt Jackie Coogan  became an overnight star with this one film He was a natural While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again on screen anyway without them there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID ****,10
29,tt0012349,The Kid is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplins oeuvre Chaplin hadnt filled a film so fully with pathos since The Vagabond  and then it was in a very limited way subject to the confines of tworeel length Additionally Sunnyside  was a failure The feature length of The Kid also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags pranks and set pieces and with the support of Jackie Coogan its one of his funniest comediesThe parentchild relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment and for me not many have neared Chaplin in exploiting that formula in The Kid The sequence where they take the kid for a workhouse away from the tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the filmor of all film In addition to Chaplin and Coogan Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture Furthermore Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totherohs photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist but the musical score added to the  release composed by Chaplin taken from Tchaikovsky gives the sentimental parts its most verveOf the slapstick one of my favorite scenes involves the tramp in fear of a bully Its reminiscent of his Mutual short Easy Street  which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film Yet The Kid is much more than that which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplins previous work This was the beginning of the tramp as the sympathetic pitiful hero as well as clown thats so recognizable and beloved to this dayMoreover the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect Its also funny in a silly way Its somewhat analogous to the outer reality story although with much ambiguity I wasnt always sure Chaplin was making any clear point such as with the Christ image earlier in the film but that seems unimportant; The Kid affects the emotions and isnt especially aimed at engaging the mind At six reels with more sets and a developed plot this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplins previous films; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth thus making The Kid Chaplins first complete feature,9
30,tt0012349,It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as The Kid It is a silent movie but so rich winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words Chaplin and year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness And I really never cry in movies And the musicits simply Oscarlevel! The movie is sympathetic full of feeling touchingly funny moments It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over  years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age don´t miss it,10
31,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous His character the Tramp is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early th century but something all of us can overcomeIn one of his first roles with this character he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family Taking himself and this very talented young boy Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote directed starred in and composed the score for this filmHere Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own He hasnt got much but he does have love which is more than can be said for the childs motherFlash forward five years and now the mother wants her son back Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion Even so the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks things not used much at the time in the movies Using these little tricks and ideas Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the storyHowever at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh sometimes in the same scene This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it,8
32,tt0012349,Is there a way to name the greatest filmmaker of all time? Probably not to different people its gonna be different person so I can speak only for myself Let me try to describe my favorite contestant for this award,0
33,tt0012349,Its easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius but Ill say it once again the man was a genius if only at doing a certain particular kind of film You wouldnt ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film or at least one like out of Germany or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the s and s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and the usual kickedaround word manipulated amid the comedic setups Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the KidAs it stands even at  minutes which was trimmed by Chaplin himself  years after its original release and including a new musical score its just about a perfectly told tale It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that Dreamland sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful lightanddark examination of all the major characters in the picture now with angel wings and devil horns! What its about in complete basics is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she wont be able to take care of him and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at and the Tramp decides to take care of him he even names him in one amusing aside John Then it cuts to  years later and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows eat lots of pancake and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an Older Brother of a kid John gets in a fight with Meanwhile the mother is now a success not knowing her child is somewhere right in front of her noseThis may sound like a bit of story but its told briskly and without a missed beat in editing and Chaplins reedit tightens it to a point where were mostly with the Kid and the Tramp Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be playful absurd cute and bittersweet to a degree We know this cant exactly last but the moment the poor maybesick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic and yet partially triumphant sequences in the movies Its in a case like this where we as the audience tear up more or less as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out and then intercut with Chaplins daring dash across the rooftops to save him that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film silent or otherwise; that its silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true even a beat with the Kid playing with toys an obviously cute bit is great and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like ChaplinFeaturing some excellent setpieces just unto themselves aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that bellylaugh part with the repetitive brickhit to the head or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin and excellent performances from all supporting cast including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance its altogether an aweinspiring feat To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness,10
34,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid the cute little Jackie Coogan has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos and true to what you would expect of his best work does it superbly  The tramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding a little boy to the mix was the finishing touch  Look out too for little Lita Grey in the angel sequence who would become Chaplins nd wife four years after this film was made,0
35,tt0012349,What makes a feature film different to a short? It isnt just length After all some of Charlie Chaplins later shorts were as long as fortyfive minutes while The Kid is barely an hour No when Chaplin made his graduation to fulllength features he also strove to broaden the scope scale and above all the dignity of his work The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplins careerThe Kid begins with a bit of backstory as a few of Chaplins shorts do but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this Here we have the opening of a drama and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief Of course such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short but here that wouldnt be appropriate Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laughoutloud funny but they certainly dont belong in a straight dramatic setting And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room sceneAnd never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration but still very natural by the standards of the time And of course little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive his movements expressions and timings all spoton so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness and he appears more like a human cartoon character Coogan steals the picture with ease and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously asideThis too is an important difference with The Kid Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act famously severing his partnership with the funnyinhisownright Ben Turpin back in  Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own The few examples such as the routine with the policemans wife and the window ledge are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material However he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this outToday The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful featurelength spinoff If you look at something like the minute Christmas special of The Office it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode Chaplins full length features however were far more than just spinoffs and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work,9
36,tt0012349,The Kid became a critically hailed international hit A tramp Charles Chaplin brings up an abandoned baby Jackie Coogan and later loses him to his mother Edna Purviance; but there is a happy endingThe film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums The comedy is sparingly laid on but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest The production is comparatively smooth young Coogan is sensational and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced His inspiration it is suggested was the death of his own first son Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in ,10
37,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins first full length feature film and his biggest success up to that date is a remarkably heartwarming story  which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy It begins with a woman whos sin was motherhood who gives birth to a baby she cant support at a Charity Hospital which is kept padlocked from the inside She is forced to abandon it in an alley and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film as he is casually strolling by and then through a series of odd but entirely believable situations he is unable to get rid of it It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin who was in top form playing the little boy at  years old Charlies life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplins traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed dramatic story The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments sometimes simultaneously if you can believe that but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival and it is never once predictable all the way until the last frameThere is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy and in between rounds  Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well and giving him hints for the rest of the fight Meanwhile the other kids brother shows up a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankensteins monster than anything else What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street This is a slapstick setup that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time were it not for its direct relevance to the storyAt another point there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home as the  version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackies arms I think this is the only time in any film that Ive ever seen genuine lowbrow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident This combination not just here but throughout the film is The Kids biggest achievement There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about although my understanding is that volumes have been written about its symbolic meaning both within the movie and in reference to Chaplins personal life And speaking of which supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing I dont know which story to believe that it was because of Chaplins painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary I would bet its a little of both but the film is here and I guess ultimately thats all that matters In the five or six times that Ive seen The Kid I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramps real son either on screen or off Then again I am looking at it with st century eyes Some of Shirley Temples early films are also a little disturbing to me although for not quite the same reasons By this time Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films and after  short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond along with a few assorted others Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema,10

39,tt0012349,The simple lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch Id say that it is as much funny as sad and the music score couldnt be more accuratePerhaps the most delightful surprise was to In the dreamland scene So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated the scene made me question myself if at the moment I was watching Buñuel and not Chaplin It is not my Chaplins favorite but its for sure one of his bests Totally recommend to be watched Chaplin will never disappoint you thats for sure If you watch this one also with City Lights and Modern Times youll be ready to enjoy his talkies The Great Dictator a classic and the perfect touching till tears Limelight,9
40,tt0012349,Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five yearsIn reading Charlie Chaplins memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him The second thing was Chaplins determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be doneThe success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they dont totally steal the film from youThe Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid Hes the same rapscallion Tramp we all know but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp one of deep feeling and protectiveness Two people who need and love each other very much This film couldnt missFirst National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin the studio and his estranged wife Mildred Harris The Robert Downey Jr biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itselfTill that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid,9
41,tt0012349,The Kid was released in  at the pinnacle of the Silent era when emotions came to screen through looks and body language when we didnt need dialog we had faces And if theres one film where Charlie Chaplins face oddly illuminates the screen its definitely The Kid Sure many fans would argue that City Lights is Chaplins masterpiece but something is too perfect too masterfully directed it was made during the talking era Chaplin was in his s and had more experience while The Kid features a more youthful director It belongs to a whole other era and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed in  Chaplin was  Hitchcock  Brando wasnt even born discovering The Kid is like turning the pages of a dusty yellowpaged historical book one eye is watching the film while the other discovers a period And I dont know if Im the only one but theres something in the setting the location that makes the film look even older For all I saw the movie could have been set in the early century and considering the timing of the film maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin himself The film was made in a difficult personal time when hed just lost his son after his birth There was a great wound in Chaplins heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragementThe context of The Kid is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time which is even more impressive considering his sevenyear experience a short time but enough to create an icon the Little Tramp an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema Chaplins story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and Im sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame  and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a filmmakerThe Emigrant in  was like the first step back into Chaplins past inspired by his own experience The movie doesnt feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future and leaving the motherland wasnt synonym of sadness but the emotions were there beyond the slapstick and the comedy and waiting for another step back to finally explode in an emotional firework which directly transports us to Chaplins past He who grew up without a father and started working at an early age he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living before it cemented his talent he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin And this is how The Kid was made and for the first time Chaplin would become more than a simple clown and get all the respect he needed from his peers as a gifted filmmaker He could finally make his first masterpiece The Gold Rush but The Kid was this necessary last breath before taking the big diveMany aspects of The Kid highlight Chaplins past and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs  a woman abandons a child expecting him to be adopted by a rich family until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramps arms But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who despite the archetypal situations didnt make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt as is the father a nicelooking fellow and a sign that Chaplin doesnt hold any grief against his father These things happen and we shouldnt feel sorry as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos  the Tramp and the KidIn every aspect the Kid is Chaplins alter ego  hes smart tender funny sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing Weve seen so many child performances since  to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is and Jackie Coogan is one of the best if not the best almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy and that the kid didnt become as much a star as Chaplin is one of cinemas cruelest ironies The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense closeups on Chaplins face  his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen and whatever inhabits the Tramps heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himselfChaplin like Disney for animation handled drama with the same strength as for comedy the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy fun cheers and even some dreamy escapism allowing a selfreflexive approach of the magic of childhood The Kid is not perfect but its a masterpiece of sincerity of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music If not his best its his most defining film ,9
42,tt0012349,This is such a incredible movieAlong with City Lights and The Gold Rush this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin and it is also one of the best movies ever madeIt is true that for the modern viewers the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the boxofficeThat doesnt mean this movie isnt entertaining In fact I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny comedies and also way more emotional and engagingI truly loved this film It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldnt be forgotten,10
43,tt0012349,The opening title to this film reads A film with a smile  and perhaps a tear Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken for Charlie Chaplins The Kid has a plethora of smiles from start to finish and yes a few tears as well The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character played by Chaplin The Tramp takes the baby into his own care Five years go by and the Tramp and the Kid portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan are getting along just fine However a turn of events results in the two being separated and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his sonCharlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking and this film is one of his best His direction is truly remarkable being able to manipulate the audiences emotions so much without sound He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget He manages to make you laugh almost nonstop from start to finish and even wind up causing you to shed a tear Its so emotionally gripping and you just fall in love with these characters from the getgo Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinemaAs emotionally wrenching this film is its simply hilarious This film has some great slapstick humor and Chaplin is a true master of it Jackie Coogan is also great If I had to find one flaw with the film it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I dont really mind it despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film Overall The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute then tug at your heartstrings the next Its an absolute riot but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema Ive ever seen And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue its just incredible And not to mention the music is just stellar too Chaplin is a master at composition The Kid is one of my favorite films and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!,10
44,tt0012349,When watching this I wanted to give the film a  rather than an  simply because I do not think it is as good as Modern Times or one or two others However taking into account that this is  and the film technology is not all there I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done it could have been made a decade later and looked the sameChaplin has to of course be given a lot of credit for producing writing directing and starring Being a great comic actor is one thing but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid and they nailed it  hes adorable emotional and seems able to handle any situation,8
45,tt0012349,The worlds most famous tramp is back and this time he has kid sidekick! Sounds kind of gimmicky right? But it works perfectly! Chaplin and child actor Jackie Coogan work extremely well together Their scenes are filled with heart and you can see that they both enjoyed themselves during the making of the movie The movie has the signature Chaplin slapstick that is guaranteed to have you in stitches but it also has some genuinely sad and emotional moments making this movie one of Chaplins most fondly remembered from his gigantic and legendary filmography,10
46,tt0012349,A tramp finds an abandoned kid on the street He tries to get rid of it in Charlie Chaplin way but ends up raising it with road side values Child becomes an apple of his eyes in a few years but the mother comes back to claim her son I had heard that this was the best movie Charlie Chaplin made but I disagree with that statement completely No doubt its a fantastic movie with a very strong story and message but its definitely not his best I found the last scene of the movie a little contrite and compromising The story has been adapted and tried in very many forms Extremely sensitive and though provoking cinema A must see for all,8
47,tt0012349,I was hardly a Chaplin fan in fact I loved Laurel &amp; Hardy and really didnt like Charlie Chaplin until I found that I could impersonate him as a lookalike  Then while viewing his films for the need of impersonating I have become a big Charlie Chaplin fan  His comedy mingled with pasos and pantomime was unique and very funny; and this one is certainly one of his bestIn it a sixyear old Jackie Coogan makes his screen debut as a little orphan that the tramp picks up and cares for five years  Every moment of this film is terrific it moves along swiftly and made me shed a tear three or few times  Chaplins score is undeniably a great piece of artwork and the acting is superb; nobody in this film lacksespecially ChaplinI recommend this film for all to see  Its age has not diminished this little love tale for a family in fact it makes you realize family love even more  Youll laugh cry and have a great time out  Rent it  Buy it View it  Its a film for all to see,0
48,tt0012349,They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but Im not so sure anymore There has been a generational discontinuity at least in the USA that seems to have happened about  or  years ago I suspect that most people over the age of  could identify Charlie Chaplin and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinctionGenerally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation but Jackie Coogan is an exceptionSentimental manipulation there is but its mainly limited to one or two scenes The comedy is pretty acerbic Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again Thats not what passes for sentimentalityBesides Coogan is cute when hes  or  years old a ragamuffin dressed in floppy oversized bags of clothing so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it And the kid can act tooCharlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him which was all he had to do Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because hes too inexperienced to know how to overact Chaplain is good too of course How could one person be so inventive? Its said that TV eats up talent because of the constant demand for new material One of the better series Twilight Zone had about three good years of collaborative effort in it Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in  films and directed something like  of them and he was just getting startedIll give one example of a joke without an iota of sentiment in it to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid a big bully who knocks him about Chaplain spots this interrupts the fight and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing  go for the belly keep your guard up  and sends him back into the fight At this point the bullys hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says If your boy beats my boy Im going to beat you Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bullys chin and flattens him But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back Chaplain dashes over puts his foot on the Coogans chest to hold him down quickly counts to ten rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand  the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy Youll enjoy it Especially if youre one of those rare folks under  with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue,0
49,tt0012349,A picture with a smile and perhaps a tearThat is the first line of the movie as it begins and it stands true We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling Wow I cant say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story Now we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally recent great movie is Finding Nemo But whats special about this movie is simplicty honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into usDone by the genius Chaplin there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling we either smile or bring tears So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do are done there Winning over a fight from a neighbour meeting angels and all Now look at the editing in this less than an hour film its neat and precise The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film Acting is sublime by Chaplin only few can do what he did and even today hardly anyone can match him Its a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch atlas watch it before you die you may learn something you never wanted to miss Its / for one of the finest silent movies ever,10
50,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is one of Chaplins best films as well as one of his most famous It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by and its not hard to see why Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector a young miner during the gold rush After getting caught in a storm he hurries to the only shelter that he can find a wood cabin in the middle of the storm It turns out that it is already inhabited and by a tough criminal named Black Larson no less and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim another prospector insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film,10
51,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is pure gold  It was Charlie Chaplins third featurelength film and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris  which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp  This movie should be counted among Chaplins best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights which Ive also seen as THE best Chaplin movie but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedys immortal geniusesHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV I saw it again in October  as part of my colleges silentfilm class on a poorquality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen ,10
52,tt0015864,Charles Chaplins The Gold Rush is arguably his finest film He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich What he does not realize is that he may find love in the form of Georgia Hale instead of money In the end that may be all right with him The Gold Rush shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer writer and director he was Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the th Century Chaplin showed humanity love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career The movie is exceptional in every way Although I am not as wellversed with movies from the s as I am with the decades following it I would still probably call The Gold Rush the finest film of that year period Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today  stars out of ,0
53,tt0015864,The  Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious As an unnamed prospector Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner the dancing roles and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff His companion Big Jim McKay Mack Swain at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplins character to be a chicken and before long a bear enters their cabin In the midst of it all the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia Georgia HaleA real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!,10
54,tt0015864,To see Charlie Chaplins The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment One cannot help but enjoy a film as welldone as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered and I can see why It is a masterful blend of comedy drama and romance among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture Like all great movies The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramps flawless physical comedy He was a master of comedic timing and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians Ive ever seen Dont get me wrong this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler The film moves along at a brisk pace following the misadventures of our hero The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin of course as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska Along his journey through the elements the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen Tom Murray a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold Fortunately our friend also comes across a fellow prospector Big Jim McKay Mack Swain who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich But the Lone Prospectors adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere When he is forced back to civilization he falls in love with Georgia Georgia Hale the most beautiful girl in town Of course it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite the handsome ladys man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia as well Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the egomaniacal lady killer All of this would be too much for any one of us but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie I am a fan of Charlie Chaplins movies but as objective as I can possibly be this IS one of the great moviesEssential viewing!,10
55,tt0015864,This silent classic has many strong points  it has a lot of humor interesting characters a good story and good settings  Its the kind of film that shows how much a master filmmaker can communicate in a silent movie  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion but other than that its a fine filmChaplin himself plays the Lone Prospector and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors rickety cabins plus some other good materialThe version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin reedited in the s adding his own narration and deleting the title cards which gives it a slightly different feel  These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who arent used to silent films You can tell from Chaplins narration how fond he must have been of The Gold Rush and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art,0
56,tt0015864,Charlie Chaplins silent film also rereleased with a narration in the early s focuses as usual on the Little Tramp and in this case his attraction to a chorus girl Georgia Hale This is the one where he eats a boot along with its laces and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rollsThe role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin Lita Grey but her pregnancy ruled her out Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions Mack Swain appears as Big Jim who shares a cabin with the Tramp at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and goldrunners as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time as a sound film it is fairly good,8
57,tt0015864,Ive seen both version of this filmthe original silent version from  and the rerelease by Chaplin in the s The difference is that the rerelease was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies To do this title cards were removedhaving Chaplin narrate the film In addition Chaplincreated music for the most partsome were classical pieces sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVDit has both plus excellent DVD extras Otherwise there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out theremany with terrible quality prints or music or both The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the  rereleaseI use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film though I might in the future use it for my Psychology classes as well I teach both because Chaplins genius came from his obsessivecompulsive nature The movie reportedly had  times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than  takes!! The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century Along the way he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb Suffice to say the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch something not true of all fulllength slapstick comediessometimes their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to fulllengthThis is a gorgeous wellexecuted piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac The musical score arranged by Chaplin direction acting and cinematography all are simply perfectmaking this in my opinion the best fulllength silent comedy ever made This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keatons films!,10
58,tt0015864,If any single figure can fairly be said to symbolize the glory years of the silent filmsthe cinemas truly international epochit is Charles Chaplins indomitable tramp The Little Fellow as millions came to call him was at once tatty and debonair browbeaten and irrepressibly optimisticand he was without question the bestloved international star in all of film history His coat was too small his pants too large his mustache patently falseand the resultant silhouette instantly recognizable wherever movies were shown Charlie Chaplins tramp spoke to all walks of lifeand never more eloquently than in such silent films as The Kid and The Gold Rush The Gold Rush is superb It deals with Charlies adventures to win the affection of a local dancehall girl and his hilarious efforts to avoid being eaten by bears and by prospectors who are bigger and hungrier than he The most memorable scene is one in which he dines on an old shoe Chaplins exquisite grace turned the boiled shoe into a gourmet feast he carves it carefully smacks his lips in anticipation and then eats it with gusto and appreciation sucking the nails as if they contained the most juices and twirling the laces around his fork as if they were spaghetti,10
59,tt0015864,In Charles Chaplins  film The Gold Rush a lone prospector travels to California looking for gold and entwines himself in adventures and finds Georgia the woman of his dreams After many hardships including a relocating cabin the lone prospector played by Charles Chaplin finds gold and becomes rich ending in success and unity with Georgia The time period in which this movie was shot compared with the technological innovation and the state of the art filming techniques give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel The use of upclose shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a new feel to the style of silent cinema The scene with the cabin shifting and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin was one of the many stylistic filming techniques that gave The Gold Rush such artistic and ingenious appeal Chaplins ideas and his vision that he brought to life in the movie The Gold Rush make it a great landmark in the beginning of silent films and in film history The intricate but simple story of The Gold Rush brought about many distinct feelings when viewing It gives feelings of happiness during scenes where there is comedic relief and slapstick comedy and also can bring about sadness or pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Years but she never shows up It reveals how silent films can become in touch with a persons feelings making them feel for the protagonist without having to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot These aspects of The Gold Rush make it a milestone in the film industry of the modern world,9
60,tt0015864,One of the best Chaplin movies which means one of the best movies ever made Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as `Eating the shoe and `The Roll Dance Both the original version and the second release have their own charm,10

62,tt0015864,We follow the little fellow Chaplin in his trip to Alaska to find gold  which he ends up succeeding in finding love at the same time The first half of the movie reunites Chaplin another lonesome gold seeker and a moralless scoundrel in a shelter under a particularly horrendous snowstorm There happens one of the most memorable scene of the movie Big Jims delusion that Chaplins is a giant of course bearing Chaplins manners chicken and his desperate attempts to eat him; but Chaplin is saved by a bear showing up which they finally eat Then parting their ways begins the second half of the movie the onesided romance with the beautiful Georgia met in a dance hall How funny was the scene when she invited out of despair our little fellow to dance to avoid dancing with an invading Jake! How genius showed Chaplin to use TchaykovskysBeauy &amp; the Beasts waltz! Bringing to tear and laughters at the same time As Georgia plays nastily and mocks and fools Chaplin with her friends and secretly discovers his love her heart swings But Chaplin is taken away by his former colleague Big Jim to become millionaires ie find gold And they find it! All ends well as the little fellow &amp; big Jim now millionaires leave on a ship While dressed poorly as in his earlier gold seeker day for a photography he falls upon Georgia who indisputably is happy to be with him and even more happy to find him multimillionaires as she hears from the ship crew The moral? Women love damned $$$,10
63,tt0015864,All the best Chaplin films have one unique scene thats very memorable because its either very funny or very touching In this film its one of the funny onesYou see in this film Chaplin jumps on the band wagon to Alaska to participate in the Gold Rush Along the way he runs into some crazy characters and has to stay out in the middle of nowhere with one of them Since they must try to survive in the cold weather Chaplin decides to cook dinner What he cooks and how they eat it is the priceless joke that makes this film so greatIts not just that one joke though there are tons of laughs in this great movie So I highly recommend it for any fan of silent films or comedies Youll have a lot of fun watching itAs of now this is the earliest Charlie Chaplin film that Ive seen but it probably wont be for long I think hes one of the greatest directors and I hope to see more of his films soon,10
64,tt0015864,THE GOLD RUSH United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations So proud of his achievement Chaplin reissued this silent film in  with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself eliminating the use of title cards Then in the summer of  THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting stations week series of The Silent Years as hosted by Orson Welles from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William PerryTHE GOLD RUSH which is set in the turn of the century opens with The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin coming to Alaska A snow storm drives him into the cabin of Black Lawson Tom Murray an outlaw Big Jim McKay Mack Swain another prospector who has found gold on his claim is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin After much struggle Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests Stranded due to the heavy storm Larson finds himself chosen to go out for help While out in the storm he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him He gets away by stealing their dog sled but is later killed in an avalanche Back to the cabin Charlie and Larson almost in near starvation eventually make a meal out of a large bear When the snow storm finally subsides the two men go about their separate ways Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia Georgia Hale a dance hall girl causing jealousy from her suitor Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite As for Jim he has forgotten where his gold claim is and locates Charlie to help him find it separating him from Georgia The results that follow is classic ChaplinAside from a large list of supporting players which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis The Gold Rush contains many now classic comedy supplements including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlies encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement There are tender moments too including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Years Eve dinner with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for themWith THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplins most revived and discussed movie one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed including THE CIRCUS  CITY LIGHTS  MODERN TIMES  and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR  Since the advent of home video in the early s THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores ranging from the use of piano organ or orchestra There are even some editions that have no music track at all along with some copies running different time lengths and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout The  reissue being a shorter print with Chaplins narration not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics but can also be found on Chaplins th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a  comedy short PAY DAY Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection But in spite of numerous editions THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics  and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter  reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector avid lip readers will notice that he is called Charlie by his supporting players especially by Georgia ****,10
65,tt0015864,If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability t you a commend this film as well as City Lights  Modern Times isnt strictly speaking a silent film although Chaplin had no dialogue there  The Gold Rush while not Chaplins best film does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits it must be seen  Excellent film   version redone by Chaplin is a bit better but either will do  Most highly recommended,10
66,tt0015864,To be perfectly honest I wish I could denounce Chaplin more fervently than I find myself able to Right down to my fundamental worldview I am a Buster Keaton person the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness The world as I understand it just doesnt work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay So wishing it did only fosters more painThis is actually worst than The Kid in this respect Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold Oh though filthy rich at that point when in the end he falls practically in the girls arms he is again dressed like a tramp  meaning no doubt he is still the same person  but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul here he gets both There is not even the thought of a compromiseYet I cant help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplins cosmology; the mysterious elusive fates  seemingly random but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose  that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocksNowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside the reality thought to be known understood domesticated into order but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void So every step inside taken casually without much thought is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death Blissful ignorance the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabinIt is a powerful cosmologic symbol what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life With both gold and love impossible love with the dream girl as the chimeras that trick the mindSo Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside but either cannot properly understand – and confuses karma for providential fate  or he does is terrified and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy taleSo however wellmeant its a dishonest patronizing vision of bliss Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging but eventually benevolent whims of providence Its all made right again more than rightNotice how well integrated is this notion inside the film proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the pointofview of the tramp who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger souldefining mechanisms that shape his life that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lessonSo instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill just wait and itll all work out in the end It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the filmSure it is occasionally very funny inventive But were talking here about the more intricate mechanisms that drive a film  and film aspiring to be a truthful reflection of life life itself,0
67,tt0015864,This is the first silent film I have ever seen so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound other than the piano in the background in a  minute movie So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas acrossI felt like they did some of same gags over and over again like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove It just got really old to me quickly I dont know maybe because Im from a different time period and way life but the film just didnt do anything for me I didnt really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only  to  minutes long and nothing would have been lost,3
68,tt0015864,Make them laugh make them laugh The American comic tradition and American movies were made for each other Gold Rush is one example that Charlie Chaplin was the father of American comedy Even though Chaplin loves to press political economical or social messages in his films The Gold Rush remains true to its genre It is a comedy non the less Even at the end of the film when THE TRAMP receives a kiss Chaplin reminds the audience that she has ruined the picture with the kiss This is suppose to be a comedy!,9
69,tt0015864,Spoilers hereinI consider `City Lights to be a masterwork one of the films that every literate person must see This film is often equally celebrated but it seems to be a random collection of integrated ideas to me Some work most dontThe  rescore and voiceover is much tighter visually but sonicly heavy If you have a chance with the DVD see it in the  recut with no sound and subtitlesThe one skit that works the best is the famous dancing rolls bit You really must see three versions of this one after another Look at the original Then see the Robert Downey Jr version done in  almost  years later Notice how much more comic Downeys is because he uses a different timing and is both doing it and referencing the Chaplin dance Then see the Johnny Depp version of the year later which pokes fun at the Downey version and reannotates the original A work of genius overlain on a masterpieceOtherwise there are better silent comedies to see And better ChaplinTeds Evaluation   of  Has some interesting elements,0
70,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is a showcase of sorts for Chaplin In it he provides audiences with a wide range of cinematic elements from his signature slapstick routines to dramatic relationships The rags to riches plot was interesting and witty but felt dragged out While Chaplin is good at emotionally engaging the audience with relateable situations like getting stood up or competing for a woman the lack of serious conflict makes the film seem simple The special effects were handled nicely even by todays standards but the true enjoyment in the film comes from watching the tramp endure hardship as he accidentally progresses into wealthiness and sees his life fall together by favorable coincidence,6
71,tt0015864,Spoiler AlertThe Gold Rush is perhaps one of the best silent movies I have ever seenAlthough it takes a bit to get used to silent movie language youll be rewarded with a marvelousfunny and poignant movieSome of the scenes are hilarious and some really touches your heartstrings Chaplin as performer gives one of his best performances in this movie There are plenty of great scenesChaplin and Mack Swain in the cabincrazy with hunger and cabin feverthe touching New Years Eve party and finally the hilarious finale with the cabin out on the edge of a cliffThe later version which was released with added narration and music wasnt as good as the originalbut easier for modern audiences to watch,8
72,tt0015864,What a delightful film I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them like the eating shoe scene fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Years Eve knowing that he was stoodup I genuinely felt for him Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time Brilliant,10
73,tt0015864,The primitive production values the decrepitlooking camera work and the silent soundtrack with only musical scores to suffice for the lack of the talkie in that era does little to ruin the viewers chance of being entertained by this highly enjoyable classic masterpiece by Charlie Chaplin The Little Tramp finds himself in the Yukon braving the wintery elements bears and a psychopath all for the sake of claiming his own fortune of gold Under his expert direction Chaplin guides THE GOLD RUSH with painstaking detail of what life would be like to live in the freezing extremes having to shack up in a  cabin in danger of toppling over a snowcapped cliff and feasting on shoes for protein Amidst all the atrocities Chaplin being that likeable underdog that everybody roots for and loves overcomes the odds managing to make the best out of a bad read terrible situation He even takes the time to humor himself and a few ladies with a songanddance number involving two forks and a pair of potatoes,0
74,tt0015864,The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights?  There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator  There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramps world City Lights falls short  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what Charlot has been all about all along It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplins works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime  out of ,10
75,tt0012349,While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplins later features The Kid is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicelyWhile its a fairly simple story this is one of Chaplins most efficiently designed movies  Every scene either is necessary to the plot or is very funny for its own sake or both  Except for Chaplin and Coogan most of the other characters even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance are just there to advance the plot when needed and the two leads are allowed to carry the show which they both do extremely wellThe Kid is also impressive in that while the story is a sentimental one it strikes an ideal balance maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies  Here the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorableThis is one of Chaplins very best movies by any measure  If you enjoy silent comedies dont miss it,0
76,tt0012349,Ive always thought theres a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies even unsentimental ones like Keatons The General or Laurel and Hardys Way Out West The latter comedy has a scene where L&amp;H perform a softshoe dance; it always brings me to tears Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that Im laughing doesnt dilute the emotional chargeOne of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already Why not marry the two things? Thats what he did in some of his early short films and thats what he does in this feature comedy The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie Jackie Coogan away Meanwhile the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesnt know if shell ever find out what became of himJackie Coogan about five in this film with his charming manners his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy is one of the alltime great child actors Want more evidence of Chaplins genius? Coogan doesnt steal the film from him This is true even though Chaplin as producer star and director makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boys talents Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles like My Boy and Oliver TwistChaplins storytelling—even with the foolish subDickensian plot twists such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed The windowbreaking scene the flophouse scene the dream sequence the tryingtogetridofthebaby scene—theyre perfect Chaplins celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselvesWant me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know I cant even complain about that Its too sweetly naïve And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the very few flawsOne important note children love this movie Show it to them while theyre young and youll make Chaplin fans of them And thats better than their becoming fans of almost anything thats being peddled to them,0
77,tt0012349,Wow is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so That fact that it still entertains over  years after it was made is quite a testimony It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama Charlie Chaplins unique humor combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember Chaplins humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stuntsThe kid  Jackie Coogan  is just as memorable maybe even more so He is unbelievably cute especially in those oldtime clothes he wore Watching the expressions on his face even as a baby are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent eraSo between Chaplin and Coogan and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next its an amazing piece of work This is a very fastpaced story which lasts less than an hourThe special edition twodisc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear actually astounding for its age Excellent entertainment,9
78,tt0012349,THE KID First National Pictures  a comedydrama written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  plays an important part his screen career Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIES PUNCTURED ROMANCE  a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies but releases coming once every two to three years A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in  eventually under the supervision and direction of himself Chaplins methods in movie making improved with each passing film Like himself Jackie Coogan Chaplins littlest costar and title character made such an impression with his initial performance nearly upstaging his impresario that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own becoming Hollywoods first important child starTHE KID starts off with intertitles A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear followed by The woman whose sin was motherhood titles much to the liking of a DW Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish yet in fact might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplins whose very name personifies comedy A young girl Edna Purviance leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father Carl Miller a young artist never returns to her life The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away Crooks enter the scene stealing the car discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else but after stumbling upon a note which reads Please love and care for this orphan child he decides to raise the child himself Five years pass The kid whose name is believed to be John now Charlies adopted son and sidekick start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money As for the kids mother shes become a star of great prominence devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts where lives the kid The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions unaware of each others identities When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention a middleaged country doctor having discovered Charlie not the boys true father sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child awayTHE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product especially for a silent movie made so long ago Chaplin who constructs his gags to perfection has one difficult scene that comes off naturally this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as hes lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot a substitute for a baby bottle back into his mouth Another classic moment on a serious nature is when Charlie is being held back by authorities being forced to watch his crying son taken away from him Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as hes being chased by a policeman from the slanted rooftops The closeup where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on filmChaplin and little Jackie billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin right down to his baggy pants Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances is so convincing that it doesnt take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp From this point onward he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor at the same time adding more plot pathos and truly great comedy routinesAs much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that followsTHE KID which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years was resurrected in the s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in  It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in  as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection double billed along with a comedy short THE IDLE CLASS  In the DVD format the two disc set includes rare outtakes and deleted scenes Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library where it made its debut December   during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights hosted by Robert Osborne and later in March  when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its Star of the MonthFor its age THE KID holds up extremely well thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan Theres no doubt Jackie Coogan  became an overnight star with this one film He was a natural While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again on screen anyway without them there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID ****,10
79,tt0012349,The Kid is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplins oeuvre Chaplin hadnt filled a film so fully with pathos since The Vagabond  and then it was in a very limited way subject to the confines of tworeel length Additionally Sunnyside  was a failure The feature length of The Kid also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags pranks and set pieces and with the support of Jackie Coogan its one of his funniest comediesThe parentchild relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment and for me not many have neared Chaplin in exploiting that formula in The Kid The sequence where they take the kid for a workhouse away from the tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the filmor of all film In addition to Chaplin and Coogan Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture Furthermore Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totherohs photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist but the musical score added to the  release composed by Chaplin taken from Tchaikovsky gives the sentimental parts its most verveOf the slapstick one of my favorite scenes involves the tramp in fear of a bully Its reminiscent of his Mutual short Easy Street  which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film Yet The Kid is much more than that which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplins previous work This was the beginning of the tramp as the sympathetic pitiful hero as well as clown thats so recognizable and beloved to this dayMoreover the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect Its also funny in a silly way Its somewhat analogous to the outer reality story although with much ambiguity I wasnt always sure Chaplin was making any clear point such as with the Christ image earlier in the film but that seems unimportant; The Kid affects the emotions and isnt especially aimed at engaging the mind At six reels with more sets and a developed plot this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplins previous films; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth thus making The Kid Chaplins first complete feature,9
80,tt0012349,It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as The Kid It is a silent movie but so rich winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words Chaplin and year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness And I really never cry in movies And the musicits simply Oscarlevel! The movie is sympathetic full of feeling touchingly funny moments It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over  years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age don´t miss it,10
81,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous His character the Tramp is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early th century but something all of us can overcomeIn one of his first roles with this character he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family Taking himself and this very talented young boy Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote directed starred in and composed the score for this filmHere Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own He hasnt got much but he does have love which is more than can be said for the childs motherFlash forward five years and now the mother wants her son back Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion Even so the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks things not used much at the time in the movies Using these little tricks and ideas Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the storyHowever at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh sometimes in the same scene This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it,8

83,tt0012349,Its easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius but Ill say it once again the man was a genius if only at doing a certain particular kind of film You wouldnt ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film or at least one like out of Germany or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the s and s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and the usual kickedaround word manipulated amid the comedic setups Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the KidAs it stands even at  minutes which was trimmed by Chaplin himself  years after its original release and including a new musical score its just about a perfectly told tale It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that Dreamland sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful lightanddark examination of all the major characters in the picture now with angel wings and devil horns! What its about in complete basics is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she wont be able to take care of him and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at and the Tramp decides to take care of him he even names him in one amusing aside John Then it cuts to  years later and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows eat lots of pancake and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an Older Brother of a kid John gets in a fight with Meanwhile the mother is now a success not knowing her child is somewhere right in front of her noseThis may sound like a bit of story but its told briskly and without a missed beat in editing and Chaplins reedit tightens it to a point where were mostly with the Kid and the Tramp Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be playful absurd cute and bittersweet to a degree We know this cant exactly last but the moment the poor maybesick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic and yet partially triumphant sequences in the movies Its in a case like this where we as the audience tear up more or less as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out and then intercut with Chaplins daring dash across the rooftops to save him that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film silent or otherwise; that its silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true even a beat with the Kid playing with toys an obviously cute bit is great and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like ChaplinFeaturing some excellent setpieces just unto themselves aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that bellylaugh part with the repetitive brickhit to the head or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin and excellent performances from all supporting cast including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance its altogether an aweinspiring feat To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness,10
84,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid the cute little Jackie Coogan has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos and true to what you would expect of his best work does it superbly  The tramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding a little boy to the mix was the finishing touch  Look out too for little Lita Grey in the angel sequence who would become Chaplins nd wife four years after this film was made,0

It isnt just length After all some of Charlie Chaplins later shorts were as long as fortyfive minutes while The Kid is barely an hour No when Chaplin made his graduation to fulllength features he also strove to broaden the scope scale and above all the dignity of his work The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplins careerThe Kid begins with a bit of backstory as a few of Chaplins shorts do but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this Here we have the opening of a drama and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief Of course such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short but here that wouldnt be appropriate Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laughoutloud funny but they certainly dont belong in a straight dramatic setting And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room sceneAnd never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration but still very natural by the standards of the time And of course little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive his movements expressions and timings all spoton so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness and he appears more like a human cartoon character Coogan steals the picture with ease and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously asideThis too is an important difference with The Kid Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act famously severing his partnership with the funnyinhisownright Ben Turpin back in  Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own The few examples such as the routine with the policemans wife and the window ledge are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material However he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this outToday The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful featurelength spinoff If you look at something like the minute Christmas special of The Office it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode Chaplins full length features however were far more than just spinoffs and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work,9
86,tt0012349,The Kid became a critically hailed international hit A tramp Charles Chaplin brings up an abandoned baby Jackie Coogan and later loses him to his mother Edna Purviance; but there is a happy endingThe film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums The comedy is sparingly laid on but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest The production is comparatively smooth young Coogan is sensational and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced His inspiration it is suggested was the death of his own first son Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in ,10
87,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins first full length feature film and his biggest success up to that date is a remarkably heartwarming story  which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy It begins with a woman whos sin was motherhood who gives birth to a baby she cant support at a Charity Hospital which is kept padlocked from the inside She is forced to abandon it in an alley and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film as he is casually strolling by and then through a series of odd but entirely believable situations he is unable to get rid of it It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin who was in top form playing the little boy at  years old Charlies life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplins traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed dramatic story The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments sometimes simultaneously if you can believe that but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival and it is never once predictable all the way until the last frameThere is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy and in between rounds  Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well and giving him hints for the rest of the fight Meanwhile the other kids brother shows up a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankensteins monster than anything else What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street This is a slapstick setup that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time were it not for its direct relevance to the storyAt another point there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home as the  version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackies arms I think this is the only time in any film that Ive ever seen genuine lowbrow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident This combination not just here but throughout the film is The Kids biggest achievement There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about although my understanding is that volumes have been written about its symbolic meaning both within the movie and in reference to Chaplins personal life And speaking of which supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing I dont know which story to believe that it was because of Chaplins painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary I would bet its a little of both but the film is here and I guess ultimately thats all that matters In the five or six times that Ive seen The Kid I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramps real son either on screen or off Then again I am looking at it with st century eyes Some of Shirley Temples early films are also a little disturbing to me although for not quite the same reasons By this time Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films and after  short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond along with a few assorted others Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema,10

89,tt0012349,The simple lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch Id say that it is as much funny as sad and the music score couldnt be more accuratePerhaps the most delightful surprise was to In the dreamland scene So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated the scene made me question myself if at the moment I was watching Buñuel and not Chaplin It is not my Chaplins favorite but its for sure one of his bests Totally recommend to be watched Chaplin will never disappoint you thats for sure If you watch this one also with City Lights and Modern Times youll be ready to enjoy his talkies The Great Dictator a classic and the perfect touching till tears Limelight,9
90,tt0012349,Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five yearsIn reading Charlie Chaplins memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him The second thing was Chaplins determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be doneThe success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they dont totally steal the film from youThe Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid Hes the same rapscallion Tramp we all know but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp one of deep feeling and protectiveness Two people who need and love each other very much This film couldnt missFirst National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin the studio and his estranged wife Mildred Harris The Robert Downey Jr biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itselfTill that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid,9
91,tt0012349,The Kid was released in  at the pinnacle of the Silent era when emotions came to screen through looks and body language when we didnt need dialog we had faces And if theres one film where Charlie Chaplins face oddly illuminates the screen its definitely The Kid Sure many fans would argue that City Lights is Chaplins masterpiece but something is too perfect too masterfully directed it was made during the talking era Chaplin was in his s and had more experience while The Kid features a more youthful director It belongs to a whole other era and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed in  Chaplin was  Hitchcock  Brando wasnt even born discovering The Kid is like turning the pages of a dusty yellowpaged historical book one eye is watching the film while the other discovers a period And I dont know if Im the only one but theres something in the setting the location that makes the film look even older For all I saw the movie could have been set in the early century and considering the timing of the film maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin himself The film was made in a difficult personal time when hed just lost his son after his birth There was a great wound in Chaplins heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragementThe context of The Kid is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time which is even more impressive considering his sevenyear experience a short time but enough to create an icon the Little Tramp an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema Chaplins story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and Im sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame  and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a filmmakerThe Emigrant in  was like the first step back into Chaplins past inspired by his own experience The movie doesnt feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future and leaving the motherland wasnt synonym of sadness but the emotions were there beyond the slapstick and the comedy and waiting for another step back to finally explode in an emotional firework which directly transports us to Chaplins past He who grew up without a father and started working at an early age he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living before it cemented his talent he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin And this is how The Kid was made and for the first time Chaplin would become more than a simple clown and get all the respect he needed from his peers as a gifted filmmaker He could finally make his first masterpiece The Gold Rush but The Kid was this necessary last breath before taking the big diveMany aspects of The Kid highlight Chaplins past and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs  a woman abandons a child expecting him to be adopted by a rich family until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramps arms But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who despite the archetypal situations didnt make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt as is the father a nicelooking fellow and a sign that Chaplin doesnt hold any grief against his father These things happen and we shouldnt feel sorry as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos  the Tramp and the KidIn every aspect the Kid is Chaplins alter ego  hes smart tender funny sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing Weve seen so many child performances since  to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is and Jackie Coogan is one of the best if not the best almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy and that the kid didnt become as much a star as Chaplin is one of cinemas cruelest ironies The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense closeups on Chaplins face  his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen and whatever inhabits the Tramps heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himselfChaplin like Disney for animation handled drama with the same strength as for comedy the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy fun cheers and even some dreamy escapism allowing a selfreflexive approach of the magic of childhood The Kid is not perfect but its a masterpiece of sincerity of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music If not his best its his most defining film ,9
92,tt0012349,This is such a incredible movieAlong with City Lights and The Gold Rush this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin and it is also one of the best movies ever madeIt is true that for the modern viewers the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the boxofficeThat doesnt mean this movie isnt entertaining In fact I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny comedies and also way more emotional and engagingI truly loved this film It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldnt be forgotten,10
93,tt0012349,The opening title to this film reads A film with a smile  and perhaps a tear Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken for Charlie Chaplins The Kid has a plethora of smiles from start to finish and yes a few tears as well The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character played by Chaplin The Tramp takes the baby into his own care Five years go by and the Tramp and the Kid portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan are getting along just fine However a turn of events results in the two being separated and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his sonCharlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking and this film is one of his best His direction is truly remarkable being able to manipulate the audiences emotions so much without sound He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget He manages to make you laugh almost nonstop from start to finish and even wind up causing you to shed a tear Its so emotionally gripping and you just fall in love with these characters from the getgo Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinemaAs emotionally wrenching this film is its simply hilarious This film has some great slapstick humor and Chaplin is a true master of it Jackie Coogan is also great If I had to find one flaw with the film it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I dont really mind it despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film Overall The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute then tug at your heartstrings the next Its an absolute riot but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema Ive ever seen And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue its just incredible And not to mention the music is just stellar too Chaplin is a master at composition The Kid is one of my favorite films and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!,10
94,tt0012349,When watching this I wanted to give the film a  rather than an  simply because I do not think it is as good as Modern Times or one or two others However taking into account that this is  and the film technology is not all there I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done it could have been made a decade later and looked the sameChaplin has to of course be given a lot of credit for producing writing directing and starring Being a great comic actor is one thing but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid and they nailed it  hes adorable emotional and seems able to handle any situation,8
95,tt0012349,The worlds most famous tramp is back and this time he has kid sidekick! Sounds kind of gimmicky right? But it works perfectly! Chaplin and child actor Jackie Coogan work extremely well together Their scenes are filled with heart and you can see that they both enjoyed themselves during the making of the movie The movie has the signature Chaplin slapstick that is guaranteed to have you in stitches but it also has some genuinely sad and emotional moments making this movie one of Chaplins most fondly remembered from his gigantic and legendary filmography,10
96,tt0012349,A tramp finds an abandoned kid on the street He tries to get rid of it in Charlie Chaplin way but ends up raising it with road side values Child becomes an apple of his eyes in a few years but the mother comes back to claim her son I had heard that this was the best movie Charlie Chaplin made but I disagree with that statement completely No doubt its a fantastic movie with a very strong story and message but its definitely not his best I found the last scene of the movie a little contrite and compromising The story has been adapted and tried in very many forms Extremely sensitive and though provoking cinema A must see for all,8
97,tt0012349,I was hardly a Chaplin fan in fact I loved Laurel &amp; Hardy and really didnt like Charlie Chaplin until I found that I could impersonate him as a lookalike  Then while viewing his films for the need of impersonating I have become a big Charlie Chaplin fan  His comedy mingled with pasos and pantomime was unique and very funny; and this one is certainly one of his bestIn it a sixyear old Jackie Coogan makes his screen debut as a little orphan that the tramp picks up and cares for five years  Every moment of this film is terrific it moves along swiftly and made me shed a tear three or few times  Chaplins score is undeniably a great piece of artwork and the acting is superb; nobody in this film lacksespecially ChaplinI recommend this film for all to see  Its age has not diminished this little love tale for a family in fact it makes you realize family love even more  Youll laugh cry and have a great time out  Rent it  Buy it View it  Its a film for all to see,0
98,tt0012349,They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but Im not so sure anymore There has been a generational discontinuity at least in the USA that seems to have happened about  or  years ago I suspect that most people over the age of  could identify Charlie Chaplin and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinctionGenerally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation but Jackie Coogan is an exceptionSentimental manipulation there is but its mainly limited to one or two scenes The comedy is pretty acerbic Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again Thats not what passes for sentimentalityBesides Coogan is cute when hes  or  years old a ragamuffin dressed in floppy oversized bags of clothing so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it And the kid can act tooCharlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him which was all he had to do Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because hes too inexperienced to know how to overact Chaplain is good too of course How could one person be so inventive? Its said that TV eats up talent because of the constant demand for new material One of the better series Twilight Zone had about three good years of collaborative effort in it Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in  films and directed something like  of them and he was just getting startedIll give one example of a joke without an iota of sentiment in it to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid a big bully who knocks him about Chaplain spots this interrupts the fight and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing  go for the belly keep your guard up  and sends him back into the fight At this point the bullys hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says If your boy beats my boy Im going to beat you Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bullys chin and flattens him But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back Chaplain dashes over puts his foot on the Coogans chest to hold him down quickly counts to ten rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand  the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy Youll enjoy it Especially if youre one of those rare folks under  with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue,0
99,tt0012349,A picture with a smile and perhaps a tearThat is the first line of the movie as it begins and it stands true We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling Wow I cant say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story Now we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally recent great movie is Finding Nemo But whats special about this movie is simplicty honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into usDone by the genius Chaplin there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling we either smile or bring tears So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do are done there Winning over a fight from a neighbour meeting angels and all Now look at the editing in this less than an hour film its neat and precise The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film Acting is sublime by Chaplin only few can do what he did and even today hardly anyone can match him Its a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch atlas watch it before you die you may learn something you never wanted to miss Its / for one of the finest silent movies ever,10
100,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is one of Chaplins best films as well as one of his most famous It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by and its not hard to see why Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector a young miner during the gold rush After getting caught in a storm he hurries to the only shelter that he can find a wood cabin in the middle of the storm It turns out that it is already inhabited and by a tough criminal named Black Larson no less and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim another prospector insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film,10
101,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is pure gold  It was Charlie Chaplins third featurelength film and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris  which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp  This movie should be counted among Chaplins best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights which Ive also seen as THE best Chaplin movie but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedys immortal geniusesHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV I saw it again in October  as part of my colleges silentfilm class on a poorquality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen ,10
102,tt0015864,Charles Chaplins The Gold Rush is arguably his finest film He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich What he does not realize is that he may find love in the form of Georgia Hale instead of money In the end that may be all right with him The Gold Rush shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer writer and director he was Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the th Century Chaplin showed humanity love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career The movie is exceptional in every way Although I am not as wellversed with movies from the s as I am with the decades following it I would still probably call The Gold Rush the finest film of that year period Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today  stars out of ,0
103,tt0015864,The  Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious As an unnamed prospector Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner the dancing roles and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff His companion Big Jim McKay Mack Swain at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplins character to be a chicken and before long a bear enters their cabin In the midst of it all the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia Georgia HaleA real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!,10
104,tt0015864,To see Charlie Chaplins The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment One cannot help but enjoy a film as welldone as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered and I can see why It is a masterful blend of comedy drama and romance among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture Like all great movies The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramps flawless physical comedy He was a master of comedic timing and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians Ive ever seen Dont get me wrong this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler The film moves along at a brisk pace following the misadventures of our hero The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin of course as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska Along his journey through the elements the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen Tom Murray a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold Fortunately our friend also comes across a fellow prospector Big Jim McKay Mack Swain who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich But the Lone Prospectors adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere When he is forced back to civilization he falls in love with Georgia Georgia Hale the most beautiful girl in town Of course it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite the handsome ladys man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia as well Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the egomaniacal lady killer All of this would be too much for any one of us but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie I am a fan of Charlie Chaplins movies but as objective as I can possibly be this IS one of the great moviesEssential viewing!,10
105,tt0015864,This silent classic has many strong points  it has a lot of humor interesting characters a good story and good settings  Its the kind of film that shows how much a master filmmaker can communicate in a silent movie  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion but other than that its a fine filmChaplin himself plays the Lone Prospector and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors rickety cabins plus some other good materialThe version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin reedited in the s adding his own narration and deleting the title cards which gives it a slightly different feel  These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who arent used to silent films You can tell from Chaplins narration how fond he must have been of The Gold Rush and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art,0
106,tt0015864,Charlie Chaplins silent film also rereleased with a narration in the early s focuses as usual on the Little Tramp and in this case his attraction to a chorus girl Georgia Hale This is the one where he eats a boot along with its laces and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rollsThe role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin Lita Grey but her pregnancy ruled her out Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions Mack Swain appears as Big Jim who shares a cabin with the Tramp at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and goldrunners as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time as a sound film it is fairly good,8
107,tt0015864,Ive seen both version of this filmthe original silent version from  and the rerelease by Chaplin in the s The difference is that the rerelease was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies To do this title cards were removedhaving Chaplin narrate the film In addition Chaplincreated music for the most partsome were classical pieces sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVDit has both plus excellent DVD extras Otherwise there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out theremany with terrible quality prints or music or both The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the  rereleaseI use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film though I might in the future use it for my Psychology classes as well I teach both because Chaplins genius came from his obsessivecompulsive nature The movie reportedly had  times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than  takes!! The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century Along the way he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb Suffice to say the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch something not true of all fulllength slapstick comediessometimes their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to fulllengthThis is a gorgeous wellexecuted piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac The musical score arranged by Chaplin direction acting and cinematography all are simply perfectmaking this in my opinion the best fulllength silent comedy ever made This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keatons films!,10
108,tt0015864,If any single figure can fairly be said to symbolize the glory years of the silent filmsthe cinemas truly international epochit is Charles Chaplins indomitable tramp The Little Fellow as millions came to call him was at once tatty and debonair browbeaten and irrepressibly optimisticand he was without question the bestloved international star in all of film history His coat was too small his pants too large his mustache patently falseand the resultant silhouette instantly recognizable wherever movies were shown Charlie Chaplins tramp spoke to all walks of lifeand never more eloquently than in such silent films as The Kid and The Gold Rush The Gold Rush is superb It deals with Charlies adventures to win the affection of a local dancehall girl and his hilarious efforts to avoid being eaten by bears and by prospectors who are bigger and hungrier than he The most memorable scene is one in which he dines on an old shoe Chaplins exquisite grace turned the boiled shoe into a gourmet feast he carves it carefully smacks his lips in anticipation and then eats it with gusto and appreciation sucking the nails as if they contained the most juices and twirling the laces around his fork as if they were spaghetti,10
109,tt0015864,In Charles Chaplins  film The Gold Rush a lone prospector travels to California looking for gold and entwines himself in adventures and finds Georgia the woman of his dreams After many hardships including a relocating cabin the lone prospector played by Charles Chaplin finds gold and becomes rich ending in success and unity with Georgia The time period in which this movie was shot compared with the technological innovation and the state of the art filming techniques give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel The use of upclose shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a new feel to the style of silent cinema The scene with the cabin shifting and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin was one of the many stylistic filming techniques that gave The Gold Rush such artistic and ingenious appeal Chaplins ideas and his vision that he brought to life in the movie The Gold Rush make it a great landmark in the beginning of silent films and in film history The intricate but simple story of The Gold Rush brought about many distinct feelings when viewing It gives feelings of happiness during scenes where there is comedic relief and slapstick comedy and also can bring about sadness or pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Years but she never shows up It reveals how silent films can become in touch with a persons feelings making them feel for the protagonist without having to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot These aspects of The Gold Rush make it a milestone in the film industry of the modern world,9
110,tt0015864,One of the best Chaplin movies which means one of the best movies ever made Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as `Eating the shoe and `The Roll Dance Both the original version and the second release have their own charm,10

112,tt0015864,We follow the little fellow Chaplin in his trip to Alaska to find gold  which he ends up succeeding in finding love at the same time The first half of the movie reunites Chaplin another lonesome gold seeker and a moralless scoundrel in a shelter under a particularly horrendous snowstorm There happens one of the most memorable scene of the movie Big Jims delusion that Chaplins is a giant of course bearing Chaplins manners chicken and his desperate attempts to eat him; but Chaplin is saved by a bear showing up which they finally eat Then parting their ways begins the second half of the movie the onesided romance with the beautiful Georgia met in a dance hall How funny was the scene when she invited out of despair our little fellow to dance to avoid dancing with an invading Jake! How genius showed Chaplin to use TchaykovskysBeauy &amp; the Beasts waltz! Bringing to tear and laughters at the same time As Georgia plays nastily and mocks and fools Chaplin with her friends and secretly discovers his love her heart swings But Chaplin is taken away by his former colleague Big Jim to become millionaires ie find gold And they find it! All ends well as the little fellow &amp; big Jim now millionaires leave on a ship While dressed poorly as in his earlier gold seeker day for a photography he falls upon Georgia who indisputably is happy to be with him and even more happy to find him multimillionaires as she hears from the ship crew The moral? Women love damned $$$,10
113,tt0015864,All the best Chaplin films have one unique scene thats very memorable because its either very funny or very touching In this film its one of the funny onesYou see in this film Chaplin jumps on the band wagon to Alaska to participate in the Gold Rush Along the way he runs into some crazy characters and has to stay out in the middle of nowhere with one of them Since they must try to survive in the cold weather Chaplin decides to cook dinner What he cooks and how they eat it is the priceless joke that makes this film so greatIts not just that one joke though there are tons of laughs in this great movie So I highly recommend it for any fan of silent films or comedies Youll have a lot of fun watching itAs of now this is the earliest Charlie Chaplin film that Ive seen but it probably wont be for long I think hes one of the greatest directors and I hope to see more of his films soon,10
114,tt0015864,THE GOLD RUSH United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations So proud of his achievement Chaplin reissued this silent film in  with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself eliminating the use of title cards Then in the summer of  THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting stations week series of The Silent Years as hosted by Orson Welles from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William PerryTHE GOLD RUSH which is set in the turn of the century opens with The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin coming to Alaska A snow storm drives him into the cabin of Black Lawson Tom Murray an outlaw Big Jim McKay Mack Swain another prospector who has found gold on his claim is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin After much struggle Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests Stranded due to the heavy storm Larson finds himself chosen to go out for help While out in the storm he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him He gets away by stealing their dog sled but is later killed in an avalanche Back to the cabin Charlie and Larson almost in near starvation eventually make a meal out of a large bear When the snow storm finally subsides the two men go about their separate ways Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia Georgia Hale a dance hall girl causing jealousy from her suitor Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite As for Jim he has forgotten where his gold claim is and locates Charlie to help him find it separating him from Georgia The results that follow is classic ChaplinAside from a large list of supporting players which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis The Gold Rush contains many now classic comedy supplements including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlies encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement There are tender moments too including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Years Eve dinner with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for themWith THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplins most revived and discussed movie one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed including THE CIRCUS  CITY LIGHTS  MODERN TIMES  and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR  Since the advent of home video in the early s THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores ranging from the use of piano organ or orchestra There are even some editions that have no music track at all along with some copies running different time lengths and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout The  reissue being a shorter print with Chaplins narration not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics but can also be found on Chaplins th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a  comedy short PAY DAY Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection But in spite of numerous editions THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics  and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter  reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector avid lip readers will notice that he is called Charlie by his supporting players especially by Georgia ****,10
115,tt0015864,If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability t you a commend this film as well as City Lights  Modern Times isnt strictly speaking a silent film although Chaplin had no dialogue there  The Gold Rush while not Chaplins best film does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits it must be seen  Excellent film   version redone by Chaplin is a bit better but either will do  Most highly recommended,10
116,tt0015864,To be perfectly honest I wish I could denounce Chaplin more fervently than I find myself able to Right down to my fundamental worldview I am a Buster Keaton person the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness The world as I understand it just doesnt work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay So wishing it did only fosters more painThis is actually worst than The Kid in this respect Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold Oh though filthy rich at that point when in the end he falls practically in the girls arms he is again dressed like a tramp  meaning no doubt he is still the same person  but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul here he gets both There is not even the thought of a compromiseYet I cant help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplins cosmology; the mysterious elusive fates  seemingly random but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose  that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocksNowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside the reality thought to be known understood domesticated into order but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void So every step inside taken casually without much thought is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death Blissful ignorance the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabinIt is a powerful cosmologic symbol what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life With both gold and love impossible love with the dream girl as the chimeras that trick the mindSo Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside but either cannot properly understand – and confuses karma for providential fate  or he does is terrified and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy taleSo however wellmeant its a dishonest patronizing vision of bliss Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging but eventually benevolent whims of providence Its all made right again more than rightNotice how well integrated is this notion inside the film proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the pointofview of the tramp who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger souldefining mechanisms that shape his life that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lessonSo instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill just wait and itll all work out in the end It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the filmSure it is occasionally very funny inventive But were talking here about the more intricate mechanisms that drive a film  and film aspiring to be a truthful reflection of life life itself,0
117,tt0015864,This is the first silent film I have ever seen so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound other than the piano in the background in a  minute movie So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas acrossI felt like they did some of same gags over and over again like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove It just got really old to me quickly I dont know maybe because Im from a different time period and way life but the film just didnt do anything for me I didnt really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only  to  minutes long and nothing would have been lost,3
118,tt0015864,Make them laugh make them laugh The American comic tradition and American movies were made for each other Gold Rush is one example that Charlie Chaplin was the father of American comedy Even though Chaplin loves to press political economical or social messages in his films The Gold Rush remains true to its genre It is a comedy non the less Even at the end of the film when THE TRAMP receives a kiss Chaplin reminds the audience that she has ruined the picture with the kiss This is suppose to be a comedy!,9
119,tt0015864,Spoilers hereinI consider `City Lights to be a masterwork one of the films that every literate person must see This film is often equally celebrated but it seems to be a random collection of integrated ideas to me Some work most dontThe  rescore and voiceover is much tighter visually but sonicly heavy If you have a chance with the DVD see it in the  recut with no sound and subtitlesThe one skit that works the best is the famous dancing rolls bit You really must see three versions of this one after another Look at the original Then see the Robert Downey Jr version done in  almost  years later Notice how much more comic Downeys is because he uses a different timing and is both doing it and referencing the Chaplin dance Then see the Johnny Depp version of the year later which pokes fun at the Downey version and reannotates the original A work of genius overlain on a masterpieceOtherwise there are better silent comedies to see And better ChaplinTeds Evaluation   of  Has some interesting elements,0
120,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is a showcase of sorts for Chaplin In it he provides audiences with a wide range of cinematic elements from his signature slapstick routines to dramatic relationships The rags to riches plot was interesting and witty but felt dragged out While Chaplin is good at emotionally engaging the audience with relateable situations like getting stood up or competing for a woman the lack of serious conflict makes the film seem simple The special effects were handled nicely even by todays standards but the true enjoyment in the film comes from watching the tramp endure hardship as he accidentally progresses into wealthiness and sees his life fall together by favorable coincidence,6
121,tt0015864,Spoiler AlertThe Gold Rush is perhaps one of the best silent movies I have ever seenAlthough it takes a bit to get used to silent movie language youll be rewarded with a marvelousfunny and poignant movieSome of the scenes are hilarious and some really touches your heartstrings Chaplin as performer gives one of his best performances in this movie There are plenty of great scenesChaplin and Mack Swain in the cabincrazy with hunger and cabin feverthe touching New Years Eve party and finally the hilarious finale with the cabin out on the edge of a cliffThe later version which was released with added narration and music wasnt as good as the originalbut easier for modern audiences to watch,8
122,tt0015864,What a delightful film I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them like the eating shoe scene fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Years Eve knowing that he was stoodup I genuinely felt for him Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time Brilliant,10
123,tt0015864,The primitive production values the decrepitlooking camera work and the silent soundtrack with only musical scores to suffice for the lack of the talkie in that era does little to ruin the viewers chance of being entertained by this highly enjoyable classic masterpiece by Charlie Chaplin The Little Tramp finds himself in the Yukon braving the wintery elements bears and a psychopath all for the sake of claiming his own fortune of gold Under his expert direction Chaplin guides THE GOLD RUSH with painstaking detail of what life would be like to live in the freezing extremes having to shack up in a  cabin in danger of toppling over a snowcapped cliff and feasting on shoes for protein Amidst all the atrocities Chaplin being that likeable underdog that everybody roots for and loves overcomes the odds managing to make the best out of a bad read terrible situation He even takes the time to humor himself and a few ladies with a songanddance number involving two forks and a pair of potatoes,0
124,tt0015864,The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights?  There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator  There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramps world City Lights falls short  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what Charlot has been all about all along It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplins works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime  out of ,10
125,tt0017136,Technically speaking I have seen this Fritz Lang silent scifi before but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the s The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable apocalyptic fantasy and religious allegory It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers who toil in the depths tending the machines and the upper classes who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers The hero the idle pampered son of the citys supervisor Joh Fredersen changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria the Madonna of the workers His father meanwhile is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didnt see In addition to restoring scenes to the film the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version With these changes the story becomes much clearer particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis Perhaps most importantly a whole new subplot is added involving the heros dead mother Hel who was loved by both his father and Rotwang With this clarification of the backstory the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer In some ways it recalls the family backstory of the Star Wars movies Of course the real strength of Metropolis isnt the story which is pretty silly and probably wouldnt have worked in anything but a silent film but its amazing visuals which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to  and Blade Runner Actually though in most respects silent films now look primitive one area in which they have the edge over modern filmmaking is in their frequently grandiose production design Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world The models of the citys towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a s film Even beyond the expansive production design and for the time special effects Langs visuals are all consistently inventive The robot Maria provides some of the movies most iconic images including her transformation into a human being In a later scene she performs for upperclass men in a nightclub and as she performs a striptease that in s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs A sign of Langs visual lavishness and the studios that he doesnt hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a characters state of mind For instance when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idols head into which the workers are being sacrificed At another point while hes sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs labor parable and Lang gives us spectacular images of the towers construction and fall In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and overliteral but theyre what silent cinema does best tell a story without the advantage or obstacle of dialogue The story is a little slow to start but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that Ive seen In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films as the workers riot and sabotage the machines endangering the entire city Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than  years,9
126,tt0017136,Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the s? Sure some science fiction movies are huge today such as George Lucas latest goofy Star Wars movie but in  Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then And sure enough we went right ahead living the way we were living the population got bigger and more crowded and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society Metropolis was run by his father John Frederson the master of Metropolis He lives in a Pleasure Garden high above the level of the workers and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father given the terrible conditions under which they live and work Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic sinister looking machine The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devillooking monster  After countless workers are consumed by it no wonder this was Hitlers favorite film they are immediately replaced by other workers who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements If some of these scenes men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured and the rest of the workers keep right on working hardly even noticingThe way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated `Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups is a saying that doesnt necessarily only apply to stupid people as Metropolis suggests Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue and the result is still compelling today The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways except that the two films can hardly be compared  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least An excellent film Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten,10
127,tt0017136,I doubt that Id ever seen anything resembling a complete version of METROPOLIS before though certain of its scenes were familiar to me if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keatons HEAVEN   In any case whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration  I expected to be distracted by the restorations technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it  As exaggerated as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards some performances such as the Master of the city are amazingly nuanced and layered and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone The meticulous design of the film the unerring camera placement and Langs muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking Id thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity important = dull but now Ive come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been,10
128,tt0017136,Fritz Langs Metropolis is the first true masterpiece of science fiction in film You can see its influence in films such as Star Wars The Matrix Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Blade Runner and countless others Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were in some cases phenomenal I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is  years old because a lot has happened in film since then Yet if you look at the basic elements of this movie  its story characters artwork cinematography etc I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late s Also take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this The performances and set designs are going to be over the top That was part of the style Metropolis may not be for everyone but for those willing to read between the lines this film still has a lot to offer!,8
129,tt0017136,In the future the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes the workers who live in the underground below the machines level and the dominant classes that lives on the surface The workers are controlled by their leader Maria Brigitte Helm who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles Maria meets Freder Fredersen Gustav Fröhlich the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen Alfred Abel in a meeting of the workers and they fall in love for each other Meanwhile Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate themMetropolis is a fantastic futuristic view of the fight of classes When Metropolis was shot it was a romantic revolutionary period of mankind history with socialist movements around the world Fritz Lang directed and wrote the screenplay of this masterpiece certainly inspired in this historical moment and defending a position of agreement and understanding between both sides showing that they need each other I wonder how this great director was able to produce such special effects in  with very primitive cameras and equipment The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art My vote is tenTitle Brazil MetropolisNote On  March  I saw this film again on BluRay,10
130,tt0017136,Metropolis is surely one of the greatest films ever made  Its scope its reach its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by todays standards of filmmaking  Seen in context of its premier in  Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history  Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great and in particular Metropolis  A great film is one that stirs the imagination leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life and achieves a kind of immortality  Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria  Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings halluciatory scenes and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions  There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria  Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups  Lastly Metropolis has stood the test of time  It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre  The story itself is simplea Biblical allegory about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen  The film is anything but simple  It is immense and a rich legacy that director Fritz Lang has left us,0
131,tt0017136,I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie This is without a doubt the best scifi movie Ive ever seen! Let me explain my position We have all seen modern scifi movies and argued over which is the best ever made but those film makers have high speed film and computers Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in  and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must see for all persons interested in the history of film as well as just good fun for everyone The social metaphores as well as the religious and philosophical double meanings are a sight to behold,10
132,tt0017136,This must be one of the greatest movies of all time I found myself almost in a state of shock during the whole movie Everything was perfect The story was great the filming was pure genius and the effects directly from another dimensionI dont think any movie after this one have gotten so much out of the available effects of the time as this one Nowadays they have super computers generating special effects Sure they look good but its no big deal making them Back in  computers werent even invented yet all effects had to be done by hand or in simple editing And when you take a look at all the thins that have been done in this movie its impossible not to get impressed Huge buildings explosions flooding picture phones however did he come up with the very idea? transformation sequences robots and so on No movie has ever pulled the limits of special effects as much as this one Star Wars and Jurassic Park are also known as limit pullers in special effects but they dont even come closeThen you have the filming Everything is perfect The use of body language is tremendous the light setting perfect everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera Ive never been witness to such a treat in filming other placesAnd the story!!! Perfect in every detail Intriguing exciting and thrilling with lots of religious undertones and tyranic leaders No wonder Hitler liked this movieI dont know how the original music of the film was but the new music for the restored  minute version I saw was really good and moodsetingAll in all This is one of the most perfect movies of all time and it deserves anything it can get Never has a / been as secure as for this movie,10
133,tt0017136,Silent movies are not for everyone Neither are subtitles Those brave enough to view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between should definitely enjoy this silent masterpiece One of the biggest productions of its time Metropolis still holds its own when set design and special effects are compared But what Metropolis really has is orginality This GermanExpressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future modern city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern scifi Star Warss CPO was based on Bridgette Helms robot Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis lookalike cities This is a very good movie Its too bad most movies dont have its originality,9
134,tt0017136,Fritz Langs groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema How can a movie thatll soon turn  years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages The world has been divided into two main categories thinkers &amp; workers! If you belong to the first category you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if youre a worker your life isnt worth a penny and youre doomed to perilous labor underground The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself Its essential viewing anyway! Metropolis is a very demanding filmexperience and definitely not always entertaining But as it is often the case with silentcinema classics the respect and admiration youll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoymentaspect Fritz brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to recreate a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines Many supposedly restored versions have been released over the years in  and  for example but the version is still the finest in my opinion even though that one already isnt as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it Metropolis perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made  A Space Odyssey Star Wars and Blade Runner owe their existence or at least their power to it,8
135,tt0017136,Metropolis is my alltime favourite movie so Ive saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb Ive enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies Ive seen but now Im moving on to other passionsAlthough written by Fritz Langs wife Thea von Harbou Metropolis was originally Langs idea he was inspired by the sight of New Yorks skyscrapers when he sailed to America in  During his American trip he visited the set of The Phantom of the Opera and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasnt filmedDespite its epic power Metropolis makes very little sense The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen so why is the one named Freder*sen* the father not son of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwangs crude little cottage the only preFredersen building that wasnt demolished during the construction of this city? Von Harbous very long and unwieldy novelisation of her script establishes this fact but never explains it How and why did Rotwangs hightech laboratory manage to get constructed BENEATH that cottage without disturbing it?For modern viewers some of the plots incoherence can be blamed on missing footage particularly in American prints The distributors for this films original Stateside release commissioned playwright Channing Pollock to translate the German titles A major subplot of the backstory features a deceased woman named Hel who was married to Rotwang but left him to marry Fredersen and give birth to Freder This unseen womans name could not easily be changed for the American version due to a couple of shots of her memorial engraved with the Teutonic name HEL Apparently Pollock feared that American viewers would be offended by this words similarity to Hell so he simply excised the entire subplot from this long movieThe reallife drama on the set of Metropolis mustve been quite interesting in itself Mad scientist Rotwang alias Doctor Strangeglove is played by actor Rudolf KleinRogge who had been married to scenarist von Harbou before she left him to marry Fritz Lang the mastermind of this film In Metropolis Rotwangs wife left him to marry the master of Metropolis Id love to know how KleinRogge felt about the fact that his reallife marital and sexual situation was the inspiration for key plot elements of this movie  and I wonder how KleinRogge felt about knowing that the entire cast and crew knew this as wellMost astonishing about this gargantuan production is the fact that nearly all of Metropolis was actually built to scale with just a couple of miniaturesTrivia tidbit actress Brigitte Helm was cast in the dual female role largely because she was flatchested and therefore she could easily fit inside the mechanical suit for the Robotrix A more busty actress would have suffered constant discomfort inside those galvanised bosoms of the metal costume I learnt this more than  years ago from an eldery Austrian stagehand who worked on the filmFor all its flaws Metropolis will always be my favourite movie Ive enjoyed writing all these reviews for IMDb The joy of posting my reviews on this site has brought me many friendships and a few enemies Well you cant win em allNitrate film stock doesnt last forever and all good things come to a happy ending This is my last review here Ill keep watching movies but other passions are important to me as well Thank you IMDb and thank you to everyone who has read my reviews I will happily rate Metropolis a full  out of ,10
136,tt0017136,One definitely cant fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Langs vision even if as always with depictions of the future there are a few forgivable blind spots The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the s as are the flyingmachines that buzz about them; while the business dress of tomorrows rulers unlike their exotic leisure wear doesnt appear to have advanced one iota!HGWells criticised the film for its adherence to arty image over scientific rigour and as a piece of coherent science fiction its certainly as lacking as he claimed The machines exist to appear awesome and to torment their workers rather than to perform any apparent task and there is no explanation of how this society functions how it evolved or how it is sustained let alone of the incongruities that must surely lie behind such anomalous locations as the catacombs and the cathedral But Wells own futuristic film Things to Come conceived in direct riposte to Langs unscientific approach is tedious and talky as a result didactic in its heavyfooted philosophy and explanations and lacking in artistic vision Metropolis may be soft SF but its approach undoubtedly makes for better cinemaI am not however impressed by it as a film Masterpiece of Modernism it may be  but great design and special effects cant save todays bigbudget clunkers from deficiencies of character and plot and they dont save this one Ironically I suspect that its reputation has benefited greatly from its being the only silent film many of its viewers have ever encountered reading through the IMDb pages I see wellmeaning comments like Great  when you consider how primitive cinema was in  and once you get used to the fact that it takes about ten gestures to convey one sentence It wasnt  and it doesnt!As silent films go this is in many places agonizingly slow and repetitious marred by clumsy acting tendentious titles and overwrought gestures By the late s cinema had progressed far beyond this laboured pantomime in Langs case the heavy stylisation may have been a deliberate choice but compared to the fluidity of contemporaries such as Sjostroms The Wind or The Scarlet Letter Asquiths Underground or Shooting Stars and Murnaus Sunrise the film comes across as ten years behind the times The problem is not necessarily with the actors  Brigitte Helm as has been observed does an excellent job in differentiating her two characters  but with the direction and pacingWe saw the restored version with the original Gottfried Huppertz score; the latter didnt always seem to fit too well with pops jumps and awkward silences but this was I assume due either to the difficulty of fitting it to allow for the missing material or to problems in the projection booth when running a newlyarrived print for the first time However the painstaking summary of the various missing scenes only ended up increasing my appreciation of what a good job had been done in the editingdown in the first place! To take a single example where the edited version conveys Freders sudden recollection that he is supposed to be the workers longawaited mediator via the simple juxtaposition of three shots  the shiftchange whistle announcing the meeting the catacombs and Freder suddenly struck by an idea and rushing off  the restoration betrays the fact that a couple of scenes of mimed dialogue were originally provided to spell out the message at painstaking lengthIt is interesting to see how it was done but most of the cuts are either an improvement or a very clever abridgement and by and large I didnt feel that what was omitted had been any great loss In fact frankly I felt that the film was in need of further editing at certain points such as Rotwangs pursuit of Maria through the catacombs She screams and runs and screams and runs and is pursued by a searchlight effect; its clever selfconsciously clever the first couple of times but the repetition becomes tedious to the point of caricature Plot infelicities abound in increasing numbers culminating in the infamous Hunchback of Notre Damestyle ending where the mad scientist carries off the girl across the roof of the cathedral hotly pursued by Our Hero which raised giggles in a hitherto serious and respectful audience with which I couldnt help but sympathiseThis is a film to see once in a lifetime so that you can say that you have seen it  not least because most of the impact lies in the visuals But its all surface and no substance the characters act arbitrarily the plot is subservient to the Message the pacing is like treacle the storytelling technique is primitive and really all it has going for it is the visual flair and the special effects I quite honestly believe that this work would be better appreciated as a set of stills in a glossy brochure; an exhibit in a design exhibition This is not cinema as I love it  its innovative it may be Art but as an actual film its only a poor shadow,6
137,tt0017136,There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator This is the predominant theme of Metropolis and director Fritz Lang finds numerous ways to say and visualize his message during the course of the film The movie relies on repeated visual imagery to make its point and does so effectively even if tedious at times Particularly effective is the representation of the worker society as an almost single living unit moving trance like to their appointed time and task The use of a ten hour clock in the workers chamber constantly draws our attention as does the hangdog posture of the individual slaves who grind out their workday as if in a dazeAmid this rabble worker Maria Brigitte Helm is the inspirational voice of the workers offering hope for a brighter future by a mediator yet to appear However the Master of Metropolis John Frederson Alfred Abel sees in her a way to quell the underlying frustration of the workers commissioning his scientist Rotwang to create a robot Maria to plant discord among the workers Rotwangs laboratory would have done Frankenstein proud and the creation of the robot is a marvel of cinematic imagery The robot Marias belly dance transforms into a scene of such raw energy and sexual awareness that it awakens the statues of the Seven Deadly Sins one of the master strokes of this expressionist filmSo much imagery in fact is layered into Metropolis that its safe to say that repeat viewings will lead to even more interpretations of its vision and not simply for its denunciation of a class society Both timely and timeless the film captures a dynamism that inspires passion even after nearly eighty years following its original release,8
138,tt0017136,I really hate it when I dont enjoy a classic film I really want to enjoy it but I just cant I want to understand some peoples love for it but I just cant Metropolis falls under this category An unbearably slow film I watched the restoration which is over  hours longthat may have been a bad idea that starts off with interesting ideas but then seems to not really do much with them It is the year  the wealthy rule the city of Metropolis while the lowerclass work for hours on end underground in awful conditions The Master of Metropolis is Joh Fredersen Alfred Abel and his son is Freder Gustav Frohlich who spends his days with other rich people in a place called the pleasure garden where he truly does nothing at all A woman named Maria Brigitte Helm brings a group of working children up for a visit in pleasure garden and Freder is quickly enamored by Maria Freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shocked as an explosion goes off and kills multiple workers He reports this to his father who is disappointed his son was the first to report it over his assistant Josepha Theodor Loos and his assistant is quickly fired This does an immediate job of showing the coldness of Joh but they never do much else with his character In fact very little of the characters are developed in anyway Most of them are completely uninteresting and the setting itself is compelling at first but quickly loses anything interesting halfway through the film as the film moves at a snail pace Anyways the main aspect of the plot here is that the workers are led by Maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of a mediator to make it happen My real issue is that the film starts with such a great idea and had potential to become something like  Im aware it came out afterwords and that its a novel but still just an example but it instead becomes filled with strange religious allusions and becomes a witch hunt essentially by the end They never really do any decent social commentary at all If any at all This wouldnt matter if the film was actually entertaining but it only is in spurts and then quickly becomes a repetitive bore I do think the special effects were impressive and this film is obviously important for being the first full length science fiction filmwell ever That doesnt mean it holds up because it doesnt In fact itd be hard for me to believe the film was entertaining in  I still wonder if I had watched the shorter version of the film how much more I wouldve enjoyed the film It certainly wouldve have been paced better considering so much of this film is unbelievably uninteresting But I dont think that changes the fact that this movie doesnt really do anything It isnt entertaining It doesnt really have a message What is this movie? I guess good special effects for ? Whatever Im glad I gave this classic a chance but I highly doubt Ill revisit it anytime soon,4
139,tt0017136,This review contains Spoilers But since the story is by far the least reason to watch Metropolis feel free to still read it even if you havent watched it yetMetropolis is a film that was far ahead of its time It influenced a great lot of sciencefiction films and how The Blade Runner Batman or Dark City would look like if there wasnt Metropolis  who knows Even The Matrix Reloaded is heavily inspired by this classic that is as old as my grandmother Now what is it all about? About Freder the son of the head of the city of Metropolis a Christlike figure who falls in love with the preacher of the working class a saintlike woman who happens to be named Maria When a robot who is modeled to look like Maria makes the workers almost extinguish their city and their children Maria and Freder save the children and in the end Freder makes his father and the workers cooperate for a brighter futureSounds silly to you? Yes and thats exactly what the story is silly Thats also the reason why still today Metropolis isnt accepted as the masterpiece it is by a few film buffs But these people dont understand one thing A good film does more than only tell a story A film can be great even without a story at all and a silly story combined with amazing visuals can make you forget all the other weaknesses a film has And wow what amazing images Metropolis offers What an art direction! What wonderful special effects! And remember as I already said this film is as old as my grandmother! Just have a look at the workers They hardly ever seem to be individuals In the mass scenes they look like one big creature moving forward or backwards When they are working they look more like machines than like human beings whereas the machines resemble monsters more than they do technical devices best seen in the moments when Freder hallucinates and sees the big machine as a workereating Moloch We also see a worker and later Freder work on a machine that looks like a clock with  blinking light bulbs doing some that looks as exhausting as it looks senseless Or think of Rotwang the mad inventor who lives in a little hut that looks in this film like it was from another world He has a black prosthesis for his right hand its not a coincidence that Stanley Kubrick gave his mad scientist/inventor Dr Strangelove a prosthesis for his right hand too He builds the robot that he makes to look like Maria and that transformation scene is one of the most magnificent scenes ever and looks more convincing than some scenes of modern scifi flicks I also have to mention Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and the robot  and the look in her eyes would already be enough to tell which of her characters is on screen at the moment If something like awards already would have been given in the s she sure would have walked home with quite a bunch of them And just look at her sexy dance! It is just as memorable as the shot of the many eyes watching her dance  or the many faces watching her preach just a few minutes later Metropolis is a film no scififan should miss I had the good luck that my first viewing of Metropolis one year ago was in a cinema when it was a rereleased after its restoration I can only recommend you to watch it in a cinema if you have the possibility to as Metropolis is just as   A Space Odyssey one of those rare films that are masterpieces on your TV set but a revelation on the big screen,10
140,tt0017136,I was very anxious to see Metropolis for the first time I had been into silent movies for a couple of years but hadnt had the opportunity to see Fritz Langs classic I finally saw it at a silent movie theater in Hollywood and my feelings were to say the least mixedThe film is visually stunning Monumental sets brilliantly directed scenes amazing special effects by the standards of the time In fact I might say that I was more enthralled by the visual effects of this movie than I was by say Lord of the Rings or Avatar Whereas Cameron and Jackson used CGI to make their visions come true; Lang had to use camera trickery paint and woodThis movie no doubt set the lexicon for the SciFi and blockbuster genre in stone The images of Metropolis have been repeated in innumerable movies The scene of the underground city being flooded has curious similarities to James Camerons Titanic Even the villainous Rotwang can be seen in the characters Dr Strangelove and Doc Brown from Back to the FutureBut then theres the story And the dialogue And the acting which is overwrought even by the standards of the time But I dont have enough room to go into thatStarting with the opening line LookThese are your brothers a violent cringe would run through my body every time the intertitles would appearThe later line about the head and hands needing the heart as mediator caused a huge outburst of laughter in the theater This serves as the basis for the moral of the story which was eerily similar to How the Grinch Stole Christmas Essentially it can boiled down to this Somebody according to writer Thea von Harbous later beliefs this turned out to be Adolf Hitler needs to appeal to the hearts of capitalist managers and tell them to be nice to their workers The outcome is a grudging handshake between the head manager Joh Frederson and the leader of the workers Grot; and thus begins a shining new day!Metropolis also incorporates religious symbolism which is to say the very least heavyhanded Scenes of the Seven Deadly Sins The Tower of Babel an altar to Moloch and the Flood all warn of doom to decadent societies that exploit the weak and kill the righteousIn the end this muddled mixture of Socialist calls for justice and Christian Apocalypticism creates a political message that Lang himself described as sillyI recommend this film for its artistic brilliance and groundbreaking techniques But dont go into this expecting an award quality filmIf you want to get into silent film this is a relatively easy one to get start with However I dont know if thats a good or a bad thing Ive met too many people whove said that Metropolis was the best silent movie theyve ever seen; which probably means that it was the only one that they ever bothered to watch I would recommend Sunrise or City Lights as a first over this,5
141,tt0017136,Francis Ford Coppola once said that Apocalypse Now wasnt just about Vietnam is was Vietnam In a similar way Metropolis isnt just about the Twentieth Century it is the Twentieth Century Almost every image in it reflects or more often predicts the realities of life in the West over the past hundred years in a way that is truly uncannyFrom small details  the traffic jams and blackouts that plague city dwellers  to major historical events  the climactic flood predicts every industrial disaster that has destroyed the lives of thousands of workers from Chernobyl to the Bhopal disaster whilst Fredersens vision of workers being fed to Moloch cant help but bring to mind the holocaust  Metropolis feels prescient in any number of ways In the image of the Manhattan skyline Lang really did find the perfect symbol of the coming century  progressive new faceless oppressiveThis is far from the simple Marxist fable it is often taken for  although the Socialist message can hardly be ignored Its also a Christian parable Maria flanked by crosses is counterbalanced by the Machine brought to life under a pentagram informed by the book of Revelation; a retelling of the Orpheus myth with Freder as Orpheus and Maria as Eurydice lost in the underworld; and a Kafkaesque nightmare of depersonalisation although the Gothic expressionistic production design is a long way from Kafkas more sterile styleIts also lest we forget a silly adventuremelodrama with a mad scientist an evil twin a bad father with a noble son and an impossibly virtuous idealised heroine In many ways it anticipates Star Wars in dressing up mythic standards with Science Fiction tropes  with Fredersen as the misguided King Freder as the handsome Prince Maria the goodhearted peasants daughter Rotwang as a scheming sorcerer and the Machine as the wicked witch appropriately burnt at the stake by the villagersThe MachineMan a confusing name for a construction so obviously feminine is the single most indelible image of the film; the scene in which Rotwang brings her to life for the first time is a real moment of magic and awe untarnished by eighty subsequent years of cinematic showmanship Even better is the scene in which she becomes a duplicate of Maria  such an obvious influence on James Whales Frankenstein that its hard not to shout out Its alive! The optical effects are years ahead of their time certainly the best of their kind until the sixties at least It also marks the beginning of Brigitte Helms truly extraordinary turn as the false MariaThis is only the third silent film Ive seen after Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and its taken me a while to acclimatise to the acting style which can seem close to parody What it really reminds me of however is modern dance which similarly seeks to communicate with the audience visually rather than verbally Metropolis encourages this comparison with the highly choreographed movements of the workers operating the machinery Bearing this in mind Helm is hugely impressive in multiple roles Maria could be a rather dull and virtuous heroine she enters the film surrounded by poor children in rags but Helm invests her with enormous energy and expressiveness It helps that the script allows her to take an unusually proactive role for a female character organising workers meetings and racing to the rescue of the endangered children However it is her performance as bad Maria vamping up a storm that lingers in the memory  the twitching jerking movements of her head and body the Anne Robinson style halfwink that changes the shape of her face that malicious little grin that makes it hard not to root for her mischief The entirely weird erotic dance that she performs isnt technically very good or erotic but it is utterly unforgettable Subtextually shes the Whore of BabylonThe other performances are mainly very good particularly Alfred Abel as Fredersen proving that it is possible to underplay in a silent film Only Rudolf KleinRogge hits any wrong notes  difficult as it undoubtedly must be to play a mad scientist in a silent film with subtlety some of his more unrestrained gesticulations leave you worried about the safety of the other actorsUltimately though it all inevitably comes back to the imagery Langs film remains unmatched even today Pick a scene any scene  the synchronised shuffling crowds at the shift change; our first sighting of the Metropolis all biplanes skyscrapers and suspended motorways; the vision of Moloch; the MachineMan awakening; Maria pursued along a pitchblack tunnel by a beam of light; the statue of Death coming to life in the Cathedral; disembodied eyes entranced by the twitching false Maria; the crowds swarming up the steps in the Tower of Babel section; the lifts crashing down one by one; desperate children crowding around Maria as the floodwaters close in; and most of all false Maria laughing as she burns on her pyre then transforming back to her metal visage No film before or since matches this for spectacle And if in order to appreciate it you have to swallow a little treacle about the heart being the mediator between head and hands well trust me its worth it,9
142,tt0017136,We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Langs Metropolis are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upperclass and operated by slavelike poor The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan These elements can be found in this films ancestors Frankenstein Batman Gattaca and the cities of Blade Runner Star Wars and The Fifth Element All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Langs workMetropolis has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes After its success in  the film has had an uneasy time Its pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in  Unless a lost version surfaces as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentinos  film Beyond the Rocks the complete work my never be seen again The restored version released on DVD in  was based on a digital restoration at K resolution from all available sources Its the best version that Ive seen and I would highly recommend that one if you havent seen the film The worst is a  print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration the film in grainy and difficult to see it doesnt even have a soundtrack I call that one the worst because Im still a little ambivalent about the  restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting good sound effects not so good and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy Freddy Mercury Bonnie Tyler Adam Ant and Pat Benatar yuck!Those who study the film myself included find the story impenetrable Some films you can easily decipher but Metropolis has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that its hard to pin it down as a whole Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the films chaotic nature It takes place in the future restored versions offer title cards that suggest that its the year  but I dont go by that in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers the Gothic sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives dancing in their penthouses and spending their money The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step They dont so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses slaves building his pyramids The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another One person that isnt ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his officeHis son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the workers children Curious he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there The woman is Maria a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be foundFreder uncovers a plot by Rotwang the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms This leads to the films most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzyThen all Hell breaks loose but the rest I must leave to you to discoverLang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film and therefore less successful the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers At one point Freder disguised as a worker witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen Another suggests an odd device a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around its edge The machine doesnt seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless dayThe film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism astonishing in its use of light and shadow One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in Another brilliant moment comes with Marias erotic dance as the men gawk the camera filled with their moist eyes This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home videoOther moments have deeper resonance There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves Walking to work they march with their heads down dressed in uniforms and caps It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler More obvious are Langs biblical references The rise of the city parallels Marias retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel The giant pentagram in Rotwangs lab as he plays God The breathtaking image of the plaguebringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself There is even a Christlike quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakersThese elements and images are brought to the film because of Langs insistence on no less then absolute perfection He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster working his cast and crew like a dictator He cast some  extras  of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone and worked them from morning till night The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with himI could go on and on this film all great films invite lengthy discussions It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over But when you get down to it the best way to view Metropolis is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of its time Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad,0
143,tt0017136,This truly is a classic masterpiece and honestly one of the best movies ever made The story is brilliant and the visuals amazingI have seen the German  minutes version of the movie without subtitles Yes its a long watch but its worth every second of it Basically only reason why the movie is so long is because they need about ten hand gestures to speak one sentence Its kind of dreadful to look at first but once youre used to it it shouldnt trouble you anymoreIn many ways this movie can be regarded as the Blade Runner of the s Metropolis is set in a futuristic world that has a same kind of atmosphere as in Blade Runner The mix of s cars and propellerplanes with futuristic machines highways buildings and androids is very unusual but an absolutely awesome thing to look at The movie was ahead of its time and in some ways also propheticThe story is absolutely the best thing of the movie Also the way the story is told and directed by Fritz Lang deserves credit The story is tense and has quite some symbolism layers and storylines but remains always easy to follow The ending is truly spectacular and tense The way how spectacular and tense the ending and the entire movie in general was really surprised me in a positive wayThe sets are obviously fake and miniatures at times but they still manage to convince and impress Further more the movie is filled with some fantastic and very convincing early special effectsMan who also deserves credit is Alfred Abel Wow what a great actor he was in this movieAn absolute must see and one of the best movies of all time/http//bobafettblogspotcom/,10
144,tt0017136,MetropolisMetropolis is one of the most exciting and exceptional works of art that humankind has produced This epic science fiction film is one of Germanys famous silent movies created by Fritz Lang and liberated in  the period between the two World WarsThis movie represents the expressionist cinema and shows us the repression of human needs by the machine age Langs creation of a selfdestructive society is a protest against the machine age Metropolis is one of the most magnificent cities of  is kept alive by the unceasing work of the underground people who live in slavery and is enjoyed by wealthy and educated people The Austrian director of the movie Fritz Lang presents the story of a master John Federsen who sees people as machines working constantly to maintain the luxury and technology of his metropolis On the other side his son Freder falls in love with one of the underground workers who is a spiritual leader for the slaves The son recognizes the unsentimental heart of his father and starts a revolution The city gets flooded and Maria Freders love regains the workers trust after a robot had stolen her identity she finds her loved one after saving the citys children and the workers shake hands with the masterExpressionism tries to simplify the world and to understand it emotionally in a subjective way It is very important to understand this definition of this dynamic violent and distorted movement in order to understand that Lang tried to externalize his own internal vision of the world through simple expressions The name metropolis comes from the Greeks and means mothercity It has this significance because a metropolis is the biggest form of a technologically and economically developed city Nevertheless referring to the movie name this film can be considered as the mother city of all cinematic clichés In this story there are two main characters Maria and Freder These two characters are also the heroes of the story because they are the ones who rescue the population from being drowned in the flood John Federson is a person full of empowering feelings who only thinks of himself and of his city forgetting about the ones who work for him All the fantasies that he has come true through the power of his workers but he never thinks about the danger they are in while working for him This man wants so much power that he is almost hypnotized by it; he is obsessed and possessed by the power of inventions and creationsOn the other hand Maria is just a symbol of munificence her soul is pure and she is seen like an angel who brings peace to the world Maria convoys the people in a church settling area She is shown as sanctity a holy person that is surrounded by the light of the candles She is positioned higher than the workers who carefully listen to her as she speaks about peace unity and their salvation by a mediator that will soon come Her eyes inspire confidence and kindness as she kisses Freder in the church scene In general all she does is for the good of humanity One thing that she repeats in the movie is Between the head and hands there must be a heart  This means that she realizes the bad things that the head John Frederson does and the good things that the hands workers do But she knows that these workers should not be treated poorly or like robots and that she can be the heart which can persuade the head and the hands to cooperate to come to common interests Maria as her name suggests is also a biblical motif She explains to the workers the story of the Tower of Babel The workers in the story destroy this tower which parallels how the movie will end with the destruction of the machines by the workforce Maria is still the representation of Jesus mother because she is trying to save the lives of the underground children She would sacrifice herself and alike Mother Mary she has a strong faith in the creator of the world All the scenes of this film are perfectly created at the eye level so that anyone is able to view the action However there is also a birds eye view at the beginning of the movie as the panorama of the city is shown from high above the ground This view was created to give us an impression of how widely extended and huge Metropolis is In addition the focus of the dramatic camera angles with bold shadows is on the disproportioned landscape as well as on the rightangled buildings There are moments in which the camera focuses on fast movement scenes like the dancing of the robot in the nightclub and scenes where it focuses on slow movement like in the beginning of the film where the slaves are shown going into the working area at a certain pace and aligned as robots When more people are involved in a scene like the one in which all the children are surrounding Maria as she rings the danger bell the angles are vertical triangular but when only one person is focused there is a closeup to allow us to read that characters expressions and feelings A good example would be the closeups on the master Fredersons eyes as he asks his secretary why his son was allowed to go underground and as well after that scene when he is thinking in order to suggest this dictators meditation and frustration Another important aspect of the camera and of Expressionism that I have remarked was the scene in which the mad scientist tries to run away from Freder and kidnaps Maria He is walking up on the roof of a sharpangled building holding Maria under his arm as if nothing would happen The same scene was notable in Robert Wienes film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari as Cesare walks up on the roof with the kidnapped fiancé and the city crowd follows himTime also is significant in the film because the clock keeps showing up in the most important scenes Time is evident in Fredersons office as his son challenges him to have mercy for the people as well as he is talking to his secretary Still only a small portion of the clock is shown in these shots and it means the time in which the master can think what decisions to take On the other hand a gigantic clock is shown as Freder finds an exhausted worker trying to turn a wallclock Freder understands the struggle of this man and replaces him There is where he finds out that at  pm Maria will have a meetingBut all that we have seen in this movie is not only made to show us the great importance of this silent SF film that can keep the watcher alive by its impressive music and can inspire contemporary movies like Matrix  but for its great historical importance Fritz Lang expressed a social life in this movie as well as a political one After WWI when Germany had lost a war peoples lives were a disaster Everyone was disoriented and could not keep up with the tragedy that was going on and maybe there were some influences of the great antiSemitism that was supposed to follow But Germany was a great disaster as well and there was nothing it could have done to prevent it because many troubles kept adding up over the years and this country had to be defeated morally and politically as well as economically Even if Germanys wish of reconstruction was as utopic as Fredersens wish of a technological city the postwar inflation had a big contribution on cinemas development,0
145,tt0017136,I typically dont like silent films but I decided to watch this one for two reasons  First I usually like scifi movies and second Metropolis had received so many glowing reviews that I couldnt pass it up  However my opinion of this film is below what most reviewers have been sayingKinos digitally remastered version on DVD is very impressive  The sound and picture quality are both excellent  However I have to conclude that favorable reviews of this film are likely based on nostalgia on the films influence on future films and on the incredible visual effects given its year of release  Film history buffs and silent film fans should see this movie  I thought this was a good film but not a great one  A rating of  is much too high and at # there are plenty of better films ranked below itFirst the good parts of the film  The special effects are excellent for a pres film  The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work the decisions they make and in how easily they are led/misled  The main character is well developed throughout the film and the audience can relate to him well  The film is visually stunning and impressive  The story of the working class vision of the future machinemen etc have had a very strong influence on many films which came later,4
146,tt0017136,For its time this movie has stunning visuals kind of Kubrickesqe in appearance especially the opening scenes of workers going and coming from work Its very strange with the group leaving walking with their heads down like zombiesThe set designs in here are also something that might draw your attention This really has a futuristic look I thought the visuals were fascinating This was German expressionist filmwork at its height I would think Director Fritz Lang went on to become a very famous man in his profession This wasnt his first effort but I think this might have been the film that put him on the map so to speak Several years later he gained a lot more fame with M At any rate with the photography sets and overall Flash Gordontype scifi look this must have been a real eyeopener to movies viewers  years ago I still think they look very cool today The music was also very dramatic at least in this restored  surround sound restoration DVD put out by KlinoObviously the eye makeup on men and the exaggerated motions by actors in silent films look a little hokey but I was mesmerized by Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and her evil clone She is something else! I also appreciated Klinos explanation of lost footage and how they did the best they could do to still make the story flow together They did an outstanding job I wouldnt attempt to watch this on anything less than this DVD which looks pretty darn goodThis is a worker story about a man wanting to trade his comfortable life to join the oppressed workers who do their thing beneath the earth in Metropolis Workers are seen as nothing but replaceable robots If someone gets hurt they get carted away and replaced immediately but some other zombielike human Of course people being mistreated can only take it for so long before rebellion Thats history from the days of the Jewish slaves in Egypt to today so thats part of this story too I wont say more to ruin itI dont want to mislead people on one major point todays audiences watching this Few people in  watch silent movies To ask them to sit through two hours of a silent film is obviously asking a lot I had to break this up into several viewings myself but thats okay I still enjoyed itbut it a silent movie this long is not easy to sit through You have to be a student of film or a big film buff to watch thisbut those people will be rewarded Over  reviews in here show you this film has enough to offer or at least take a look Now that this restored version is available check it out!,7
147,tt0017136,OK first of all Im not some kind of actionjunkie who thinks that the Rambotrilogy is the best movies of all time I am a person who think that other silents like Nosferatu and The Battleship Potemkin are entertainingAlthough I loved the previous movies referred to I thought this was one of the most dull movies ever As entertainment this movie cant go very far On a scale rating its abilities to entertain it gets a / from meAs a milestone in the history of movies it goes all the way to the top The special effects were great to have been made almost  years ago The editing was great It must have been one of the most expensive movie made to that date On the scale of how important a chapter in the cinematic history this is I will rate it a / That means a total / This also means that you should rather check out really good silents like Chaplins Modern Times Eisensteins The Battleship Potemkin and Murnaus Nosferatu,8
148,tt0017136,Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium and his  opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format a fully restored print on the KINO DVD filled with intertitles to keep the story complete that had me appreciate it more but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music ie Giorgio Moroders experimental cut it would still be affecting At the core of the story Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou the sides of good vs evil or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak is set up so strongly that even when it has its fairytale type of heaviness to it it doesnt seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults This is the kind of film that should work for anyone young and old as it deals with universal themes ie The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!The story leaves room for the visual style to come through Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis Joh Frederson He feels the sorrow and pain of the people and goes down to their level to be one of them He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women Maria played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm in multiple roles she plays without a fault who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freders father Enter the robot a marvel of a mad scientist who gets transposed from Maria and becomes the havocwrecker of the part of Metropolis I wont reveal too much of the story except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lapAmidst in all of this Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects cameratricks and of course editing if I wouldnt quite rank Metropolis in my alltime top ten favorites I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day cars moving on roads built to the sky airplanes flying everywhich way and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways But its not just the use of the models or the sets or the backdrops or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Langs shots which are all spectacular its also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene it also appears in other scenes I think Its little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages the superimpositions of faces and eyes in the dreamlike shotsAnd of course Langs greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story he goes beyond his time period in stylizing As I mentioned with the pacing being unique it was surprising though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M that many of the suspense sequences mob scenes/riots chases I knew that this is the same kind of styling thats used today for many of the most modern of sciencefiction/action films In its own way much like Stanley Kubricks  Space Oddysey it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling while not completely abandoning the storytelling form Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries and it hasnt been seen in its full form in almost eighty years what remains doesnt seem at all dated or crude Quite the opposite its visual expressiveness its use of time and character and action and its deliberate pacing makes it ahead of its time and influential and at the same time keeping itself unique Its a tale were all familiar with being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial cruel world which Im sure was even more relevant to post WW Germany at the time filmed with a mix of overthetop melodrama megabudget setpieces and designs that confound the senses Add the appropriate music and youve got a classic fantasy A tremendous film to see two three a dozen times over though some of those too impatient for films without spoken words or by the operatic dramatic side of it all may become disappointed or frustrated,10
149,tt0017136,For many years the initially flopped and consequently butchered Metropolis Fritz Lang made in the mid twenties of the past century could be appreciated at least for its qualities as the indispensable sciencefiction trailblazer in motion picture history What was severely lacking from the plot however finally emerged on screen again after the famous Buenos Aires reel find which brought a quarter of what was missing from the film back from the dead With the new painstaking  restoration effort also came a grandiose symphony orchestra studio recording of the original Gottfried Huppertz score  and the results make movie buffs prone to be blown away and this time for realThe technical brilliance and visual lavishness of Fritz Langs oeuvre was always undisputed already at its time and only matched by fellow German Murnaus ingenious approaches on filmmaking Theres so much and dense imagery that generations of future filmmakers would draw from this newly emerging archetype Among the unforgettable scenes are the giant heart machine which turns into a moloch in one of the heros visions the Babel tower teeming with utopian life the enormous sets elevators and masses and masses of enslaved and rebellious people the staggering creation of the first robot all set against the dominant dichotomy between  literally  those living above and those dying below There are echoes of communism here of nazi ideology of the dangers and abysses of industrialization technology and there are also glimpses of humanity Not perfect in all its components the film nevertheless has everything pioneering in it  and more Fritz Lang while having some reservations himself referred to the picture as a signpost for new destinations and thats exactly what it became now that we can look at the great scifi pictures of the past century In them and through them Metropolis still lives and once we revisit the original again we might yet be surprised that it miraculously still points ahead,10
150,tt0012349,While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplins later features The Kid is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicelyWhile its a fairly simple story this is one of Chaplins most efficiently designed movies  Every scene either is necessary to the plot or is very funny for its own sake or both  Except for Chaplin and Coogan most of the other characters even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance are just there to advance the plot when needed and the two leads are allowed to carry the show which they both do extremely wellThe Kid is also impressive in that while the story is a sentimental one it strikes an ideal balance maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies  Here the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorableThis is one of Chaplins very best movies by any measure  If you enjoy silent comedies dont miss it,0
151,tt0012349,Ive always thought theres a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies even unsentimental ones like Keatons The General or Laurel and Hardys Way Out West The latter comedy has a scene where L&amp;H perform a softshoe dance; it always brings me to tears Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that Im laughing doesnt dilute the emotional chargeOne of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already Why not marry the two things? Thats what he did in some of his early short films and thats what he does in this feature comedy The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie Jackie Coogan away Meanwhile the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesnt know if shell ever find out what became of himJackie Coogan about five in this film with his charming manners his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy is one of the alltime great child actors Want more evidence of Chaplins genius? Coogan doesnt steal the film from him This is true even though Chaplin as producer star and director makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boys talents Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles like My Boy and Oliver TwistChaplins storytelling—even with the foolish subDickensian plot twists such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed The windowbreaking scene the flophouse scene the dream sequence the tryingtogetridofthebaby scene—theyre perfect Chaplins celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselvesWant me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know I cant even complain about that Its too sweetly naïve And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the very few flawsOne important note children love this movie Show it to them while theyre young and youll make Chaplin fans of them And thats better than their becoming fans of almost anything thats being peddled to them,0
152,tt0012349,Wow is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so That fact that it still entertains over  years after it was made is quite a testimony It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama Charlie Chaplins unique humor combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember Chaplins humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stuntsThe kid  Jackie Coogan  is just as memorable maybe even more so He is unbelievably cute especially in those oldtime clothes he wore Watching the expressions on his face even as a baby are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent eraSo between Chaplin and Coogan and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next its an amazing piece of work This is a very fastpaced story which lasts less than an hourThe special edition twodisc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear actually astounding for its age Excellent entertainment,9
153,tt0012349,THE KID First National Pictures  a comedydrama written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  plays an important part his screen career Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIES PUNCTURED ROMANCE  a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies but releases coming once every two to three years A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in  eventually under the supervision and direction of himself Chaplins methods in movie making improved with each passing film Like himself Jackie Coogan Chaplins littlest costar and title character made such an impression with his initial performance nearly upstaging his impresario that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own becoming Hollywoods first important child starTHE KID starts off with intertitles A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear followed by The woman whose sin was motherhood titles much to the liking of a DW Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish yet in fact might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplins whose very name personifies comedy A young girl Edna Purviance leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father Carl Miller a young artist never returns to her life The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away Crooks enter the scene stealing the car discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else but after stumbling upon a note which reads Please love and care for this orphan child he decides to raise the child himself Five years pass The kid whose name is believed to be John now Charlies adopted son and sidekick start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money As for the kids mother shes become a star of great prominence devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts where lives the kid The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions unaware of each others identities When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention a middleaged country doctor having discovered Charlie not the boys true father sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child awayTHE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product especially for a silent movie made so long ago Chaplin who constructs his gags to perfection has one difficult scene that comes off naturally this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as hes lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot a substitute for a baby bottle back into his mouth Another classic moment on a serious nature is when Charlie is being held back by authorities being forced to watch his crying son taken away from him Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as hes being chased by a policeman from the slanted rooftops The closeup where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on filmChaplin and little Jackie billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin right down to his baggy pants Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances is so convincing that it doesnt take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp From this point onward he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor at the same time adding more plot pathos and truly great comedy routinesAs much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that followsTHE KID which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years was resurrected in the s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in  It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in  as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection double billed along with a comedy short THE IDLE CLASS  In the DVD format the two disc set includes rare outtakes and deleted scenes Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library where it made its debut December   during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights hosted by Robert Osborne and later in March  when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its Star of the MonthFor its age THE KID holds up extremely well thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan Theres no doubt Jackie Coogan  became an overnight star with this one film He was a natural While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again on screen anyway without them there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID ****,10
154,tt0012349,The Kid is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplins oeuvre Chaplin hadnt filled a film so fully with pathos since The Vagabond  and then it was in a very limited way subject to the confines of tworeel length Additionally Sunnyside  was a failure The feature length of The Kid also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags pranks and set pieces and with the support of Jackie Coogan its one of his funniest comediesThe parentchild relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment and for me not many have neared Chaplin in exploiting that formula in The Kid The sequence where they take the kid for a workhouse away from the tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the filmor of all film In addition to Chaplin and Coogan Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture Furthermore Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totherohs photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist but the musical score added to the  release composed by Chaplin taken from Tchaikovsky gives the sentimental parts its most verveOf the slapstick one of my favorite scenes involves the tramp in fear of a bully Its reminiscent of his Mutual short Easy Street  which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film Yet The Kid is much more than that which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplins previous work This was the beginning of the tramp as the sympathetic pitiful hero as well as clown thats so recognizable and beloved to this dayMoreover the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect Its also funny in a silly way Its somewhat analogous to the outer reality story although with much ambiguity I wasnt always sure Chaplin was making any clear point such as with the Christ image earlier in the film but that seems unimportant; The Kid affects the emotions and isnt especially aimed at engaging the mind At six reels with more sets and a developed plot this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplins previous films; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth thus making The Kid Chaplins first complete feature,9
155,tt0012349,It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as The Kid It is a silent movie but so rich winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words Chaplin and year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness And I really never cry in movies And the musicits simply Oscarlevel! The movie is sympathetic full of feeling touchingly funny moments It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over  years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age don´t miss it,10
156,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous His character the Tramp is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early th century but something all of us can overcomeIn one of his first roles with this character he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family Taking himself and this very talented young boy Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote directed starred in and composed the score for this filmHere Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own He hasnt got much but he does have love which is more than can be said for the childs motherFlash forward five years and now the mother wants her son back Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion Even so the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks things not used much at the time in the movies Using these little tricks and ideas Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the storyHowever at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh sometimes in the same scene This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it,8

158,tt0012349,Its easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius but Ill say it once again the man was a genius if only at doing a certain particular kind of film You wouldnt ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film or at least one like out of Germany or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the s and s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and the usual kickedaround word manipulated amid the comedic setups Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the KidAs it stands even at  minutes which was trimmed by Chaplin himself  years after its original release and including a new musical score its just about a perfectly told tale It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that Dreamland sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful lightanddark examination of all the major characters in the picture now with angel wings and devil horns! What its about in complete basics is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she wont be able to take care of him and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at and the Tramp decides to take care of him he even names him in one amusing aside John Then it cuts to  years later and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows eat lots of pancake and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an Older Brother of a kid John gets in a fight with Meanwhile the mother is now a success not knowing her child is somewhere right in front of her noseThis may sound like a bit of story but its told briskly and without a missed beat in editing and Chaplins reedit tightens it to a point where were mostly with the Kid and the Tramp Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be playful absurd cute and bittersweet to a degree We know this cant exactly last but the moment the poor maybesick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic and yet partially triumphant sequences in the movies Its in a case like this where we as the audience tear up more or less as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out and then intercut with Chaplins daring dash across the rooftops to save him that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film silent or otherwise; that its silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true even a beat with the Kid playing with toys an obviously cute bit is great and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like ChaplinFeaturing some excellent setpieces just unto themselves aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that bellylaugh part with the repetitive brickhit to the head or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin and excellent performances from all supporting cast including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance its altogether an aweinspiring feat To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness,10
159,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid the cute little Jackie Coogan has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos and true to what you would expect of his best work does it superbly  The tramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding a little boy to the mix was the finishing touch  Look out too for little Lita Grey in the angel sequence who would become Chaplins nd wife four years after this film was made,0

It isnt just length After all some of Charlie Chaplins later shorts were as long as fortyfive minutes while The Kid is barely an hour No when Chaplin made his graduation to fulllength features he also strove to broaden the scope scale and above all the dignity of his work The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplins careerThe Kid begins with a bit of backstory as a few of Chaplins shorts do but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this Here we have the opening of a drama and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief Of course such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short but here that wouldnt be appropriate Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laughoutloud funny but they certainly dont belong in a straight dramatic setting And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room sceneAnd never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration but still very natural by the standards of the time And of course little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive his movements expressions and timings all spoton so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness and he appears more like a human cartoon character Coogan steals the picture with ease and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously asideThis too is an important difference with The Kid Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act famously severing his partnership with the funnyinhisownright Ben Turpin back in  Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own The few examples such as the routine with the policemans wife and the window ledge are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material However he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this outToday The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful featurelength spinoff If you look at something like the minute Christmas special of The Office it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode Chaplins full length features however were far more than just spinoffs and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work,9
161,tt0012349,The Kid became a critically hailed international hit A tramp Charles Chaplin brings up an abandoned baby Jackie Coogan and later loses him to his mother Edna Purviance; but there is a happy endingThe film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums The comedy is sparingly laid on but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest The production is comparatively smooth young Coogan is sensational and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced His inspiration it is suggested was the death of his own first son Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in ,10
162,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins first full length feature film and his biggest success up to that date is a remarkably heartwarming story  which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy It begins with a woman whos sin was motherhood who gives birth to a baby she cant support at a Charity Hospital which is kept padlocked from the inside She is forced to abandon it in an alley and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film as he is casually strolling by and then through a series of odd but entirely believable situations he is unable to get rid of it It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin who was in top form playing the little boy at  years old Charlies life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplins traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed dramatic story The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments sometimes simultaneously if you can believe that but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival and it is never once predictable all the way until the last frameThere is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy and in between rounds  Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well and giving him hints for the rest of the fight Meanwhile the other kids brother shows up a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankensteins monster than anything else What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street This is a slapstick setup that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time were it not for its direct relevance to the storyAt another point there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home as the  version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackies arms I think this is the only time in any film that Ive ever seen genuine lowbrow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident This combination not just here but throughout the film is The Kids biggest achievement There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about although my understanding is that volumes have been written about its symbolic meaning both within the movie and in reference to Chaplins personal life And speaking of which supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing I dont know which story to believe that it was because of Chaplins painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary I would bet its a little of both but the film is here and I guess ultimately thats all that matters In the five or six times that Ive seen The Kid I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramps real son either on screen or off Then again I am looking at it with st century eyes Some of Shirley Temples early films are also a little disturbing to me although for not quite the same reasons By this time Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films and after  short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond along with a few assorted others Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema,10

164,tt0012349,The simple lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch Id say that it is as much funny as sad and the music score couldnt be more accuratePerhaps the most delightful surprise was to In the dreamland scene So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated the scene made me question myself if at the moment I was watching Buñuel and not Chaplin It is not my Chaplins favorite but its for sure one of his bests Totally recommend to be watched Chaplin will never disappoint you thats for sure If you watch this one also with City Lights and Modern Times youll be ready to enjoy his talkies The Great Dictator a classic and the perfect touching till tears Limelight,9
165,tt0012349,Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five yearsIn reading Charlie Chaplins memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him The second thing was Chaplins determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be doneThe success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they dont totally steal the film from youThe Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid Hes the same rapscallion Tramp we all know but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp one of deep feeling and protectiveness Two people who need and love each other very much This film couldnt missFirst National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin the studio and his estranged wife Mildred Harris The Robert Downey Jr biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itselfTill that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid,9
166,tt0012349,The Kid was released in  at the pinnacle of the Silent era when emotions came to screen through looks and body language when we didnt need dialog we had faces And if theres one film where Charlie Chaplins face oddly illuminates the screen its definitely The Kid Sure many fans would argue that City Lights is Chaplins masterpiece but something is too perfect too masterfully directed it was made during the talking era Chaplin was in his s and had more experience while The Kid features a more youthful director It belongs to a whole other era and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed in  Chaplin was  Hitchcock  Brando wasnt even born discovering The Kid is like turning the pages of a dusty yellowpaged historical book one eye is watching the film while the other discovers a period And I dont know if Im the only one but theres something in the setting the location that makes the film look even older For all I saw the movie could have been set in the early century and considering the timing of the film maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin himself The film was made in a difficult personal time when hed just lost his son after his birth There was a great wound in Chaplins heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragementThe context of The Kid is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time which is even more impressive considering his sevenyear experience a short time but enough to create an icon the Little Tramp an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema Chaplins story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and Im sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame  and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a filmmakerThe Emigrant in  was like the first step back into Chaplins past inspired by his own experience The movie doesnt feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future and leaving the motherland wasnt synonym of sadness but the emotions were there beyond the slapstick and the comedy and waiting for another step back to finally explode in an emotional firework which directly transports us to Chaplins past He who grew up without a father and started working at an early age he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living before it cemented his talent he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin And this is how The Kid was made and for the first time Chaplin would become more than a simple clown and get all the respect he needed from his peers as a gifted filmmaker He could finally make his first masterpiece The Gold Rush but The Kid was this necessary last breath before taking the big diveMany aspects of The Kid highlight Chaplins past and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs  a woman abandons a child expecting him to be adopted by a rich family until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramps arms But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who despite the archetypal situations didnt make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt as is the father a nicelooking fellow and a sign that Chaplin doesnt hold any grief against his father These things happen and we shouldnt feel sorry as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos  the Tramp and the KidIn every aspect the Kid is Chaplins alter ego  hes smart tender funny sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing Weve seen so many child performances since  to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is and Jackie Coogan is one of the best if not the best almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy and that the kid didnt become as much a star as Chaplin is one of cinemas cruelest ironies The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense closeups on Chaplins face  his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen and whatever inhabits the Tramps heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himselfChaplin like Disney for animation handled drama with the same strength as for comedy the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy fun cheers and even some dreamy escapism allowing a selfreflexive approach of the magic of childhood The Kid is not perfect but its a masterpiece of sincerity of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music If not his best its his most defining film ,9
167,tt0012349,This is such a incredible movieAlong with City Lights and The Gold Rush this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin and it is also one of the best movies ever madeIt is true that for the modern viewers the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the boxofficeThat doesnt mean this movie isnt entertaining In fact I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny comedies and also way more emotional and engagingI truly loved this film It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldnt be forgotten,10
168,tt0012349,The opening title to this film reads A film with a smile  and perhaps a tear Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken for Charlie Chaplins The Kid has a plethora of smiles from start to finish and yes a few tears as well The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character played by Chaplin The Tramp takes the baby into his own care Five years go by and the Tramp and the Kid portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan are getting along just fine However a turn of events results in the two being separated and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his sonCharlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking and this film is one of his best His direction is truly remarkable being able to manipulate the audiences emotions so much without sound He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget He manages to make you laugh almost nonstop from start to finish and even wind up causing you to shed a tear Its so emotionally gripping and you just fall in love with these characters from the getgo Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinemaAs emotionally wrenching this film is its simply hilarious This film has some great slapstick humor and Chaplin is a true master of it Jackie Coogan is also great If I had to find one flaw with the film it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I dont really mind it despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film Overall The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute then tug at your heartstrings the next Its an absolute riot but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema Ive ever seen And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue its just incredible And not to mention the music is just stellar too Chaplin is a master at composition The Kid is one of my favorite films and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!,10
169,tt0012349,When watching this I wanted to give the film a  rather than an  simply because I do not think it is as good as Modern Times or one or two others However taking into account that this is  and the film technology is not all there I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done it could have been made a decade later and looked the sameChaplin has to of course be given a lot of credit for producing writing directing and starring Being a great comic actor is one thing but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid and they nailed it  hes adorable emotional and seems able to handle any situation,8
170,tt0012349,The worlds most famous tramp is back and this time he has kid sidekick! Sounds kind of gimmicky right? But it works perfectly! Chaplin and child actor Jackie Coogan work extremely well together Their scenes are filled with heart and you can see that they both enjoyed themselves during the making of the movie The movie has the signature Chaplin slapstick that is guaranteed to have you in stitches but it also has some genuinely sad and emotional moments making this movie one of Chaplins most fondly remembered from his gigantic and legendary filmography,10
171,tt0012349,A tramp finds an abandoned kid on the street He tries to get rid of it in Charlie Chaplin way but ends up raising it with road side values Child becomes an apple of his eyes in a few years but the mother comes back to claim her son I had heard that this was the best movie Charlie Chaplin made but I disagree with that statement completely No doubt its a fantastic movie with a very strong story and message but its definitely not his best I found the last scene of the movie a little contrite and compromising The story has been adapted and tried in very many forms Extremely sensitive and though provoking cinema A must see for all,8
172,tt0012349,I was hardly a Chaplin fan in fact I loved Laurel &amp; Hardy and really didnt like Charlie Chaplin until I found that I could impersonate him as a lookalike  Then while viewing his films for the need of impersonating I have become a big Charlie Chaplin fan  His comedy mingled with pasos and pantomime was unique and very funny; and this one is certainly one of his bestIn it a sixyear old Jackie Coogan makes his screen debut as a little orphan that the tramp picks up and cares for five years  Every moment of this film is terrific it moves along swiftly and made me shed a tear three or few times  Chaplins score is undeniably a great piece of artwork and the acting is superb; nobody in this film lacksespecially ChaplinI recommend this film for all to see  Its age has not diminished this little love tale for a family in fact it makes you realize family love even more  Youll laugh cry and have a great time out  Rent it  Buy it View it  Its a film for all to see,0
173,tt0012349,They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but Im not so sure anymore There has been a generational discontinuity at least in the USA that seems to have happened about  or  years ago I suspect that most people over the age of  could identify Charlie Chaplin and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinctionGenerally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation but Jackie Coogan is an exceptionSentimental manipulation there is but its mainly limited to one or two scenes The comedy is pretty acerbic Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again Thats not what passes for sentimentalityBesides Coogan is cute when hes  or  years old a ragamuffin dressed in floppy oversized bags of clothing so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it And the kid can act tooCharlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him which was all he had to do Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because hes too inexperienced to know how to overact Chaplain is good too of course How could one person be so inventive? Its said that TV eats up talent because of the constant demand for new material One of the better series Twilight Zone had about three good years of collaborative effort in it Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in  films and directed something like  of them and he was just getting startedIll give one example of a joke without an iota of sentiment in it to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid a big bully who knocks him about Chaplain spots this interrupts the fight and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing  go for the belly keep your guard up  and sends him back into the fight At this point the bullys hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says If your boy beats my boy Im going to beat you Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bullys chin and flattens him But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back Chaplain dashes over puts his foot on the Coogans chest to hold him down quickly counts to ten rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand  the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy Youll enjoy it Especially if youre one of those rare folks under  with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue,0
174,tt0012349,A picture with a smile and perhaps a tearThat is the first line of the movie as it begins and it stands true We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling Wow I cant say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story Now we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally recent great movie is Finding Nemo But whats special about this movie is simplicty honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into usDone by the genius Chaplin there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling we either smile or bring tears So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do are done there Winning over a fight from a neighbour meeting angels and all Now look at the editing in this less than an hour film its neat and precise The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film Acting is sublime by Chaplin only few can do what he did and even today hardly anyone can match him Its a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch atlas watch it before you die you may learn something you never wanted to miss Its / for one of the finest silent movies ever,10
175,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is one of Chaplins best films as well as one of his most famous It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by and its not hard to see why Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector a young miner during the gold rush After getting caught in a storm he hurries to the only shelter that he can find a wood cabin in the middle of the storm It turns out that it is already inhabited and by a tough criminal named Black Larson no less and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim another prospector insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film,10
176,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is pure gold  It was Charlie Chaplins third featurelength film and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris  which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp  This movie should be counted among Chaplins best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights which Ive also seen as THE best Chaplin movie but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedys immortal geniusesHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV I saw it again in October  as part of my colleges silentfilm class on a poorquality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen ,10
177,tt0015864,Charles Chaplins The Gold Rush is arguably his finest film He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich What he does not realize is that he may find love in the form of Georgia Hale instead of money In the end that may be all right with him The Gold Rush shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer writer and director he was Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the th Century Chaplin showed humanity love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career The movie is exceptional in every way Although I am not as wellversed with movies from the s as I am with the decades following it I would still probably call The Gold Rush the finest film of that year period Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today  stars out of ,0
178,tt0015864,The  Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious As an unnamed prospector Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner the dancing roles and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff His companion Big Jim McKay Mack Swain at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplins character to be a chicken and before long a bear enters their cabin In the midst of it all the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia Georgia HaleA real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!,10
179,tt0015864,To see Charlie Chaplins The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment One cannot help but enjoy a film as welldone as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered and I can see why It is a masterful blend of comedy drama and romance among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture Like all great movies The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramps flawless physical comedy He was a master of comedic timing and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians Ive ever seen Dont get me wrong this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler The film moves along at a brisk pace following the misadventures of our hero The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin of course as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska Along his journey through the elements the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen Tom Murray a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold Fortunately our friend also comes across a fellow prospector Big Jim McKay Mack Swain who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich But the Lone Prospectors adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere When he is forced back to civilization he falls in love with Georgia Georgia Hale the most beautiful girl in town Of course it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite the handsome ladys man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia as well Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the egomaniacal lady killer All of this would be too much for any one of us but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie I am a fan of Charlie Chaplins movies but as objective as I can possibly be this IS one of the great moviesEssential viewing!,10
180,tt0015864,This silent classic has many strong points  it has a lot of humor interesting characters a good story and good settings  Its the kind of film that shows how much a master filmmaker can communicate in a silent movie  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion but other than that its a fine filmChaplin himself plays the Lone Prospector and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors rickety cabins plus some other good materialThe version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin reedited in the s adding his own narration and deleting the title cards which gives it a slightly different feel  These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who arent used to silent films You can tell from Chaplins narration how fond he must have been of The Gold Rush and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art,0
181,tt0015864,Charlie Chaplins silent film also rereleased with a narration in the early s focuses as usual on the Little Tramp and in this case his attraction to a chorus girl Georgia Hale This is the one where he eats a boot along with its laces and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rollsThe role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin Lita Grey but her pregnancy ruled her out Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions Mack Swain appears as Big Jim who shares a cabin with the Tramp at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and goldrunners as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time as a sound film it is fairly good,8
182,tt0015864,Ive seen both version of this filmthe original silent version from  and the rerelease by Chaplin in the s The difference is that the rerelease was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies To do this title cards were removedhaving Chaplin narrate the film In addition Chaplincreated music for the most partsome were classical pieces sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVDit has both plus excellent DVD extras Otherwise there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out theremany with terrible quality prints or music or both The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the  rereleaseI use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film though I might in the future use it for my Psychology classes as well I teach both because Chaplins genius came from his obsessivecompulsive nature The movie reportedly had  times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than  takes!! The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century Along the way he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb Suffice to say the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch something not true of all fulllength slapstick comediessometimes their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to fulllengthThis is a gorgeous wellexecuted piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac The musical score arranged by Chaplin direction acting and cinematography all are simply perfectmaking this in my opinion the best fulllength silent comedy ever made This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keatons films!,10
183,tt0015864,If any single figure can fairly be said to symbolize the glory years of the silent filmsthe cinemas truly international epochit is Charles Chaplins indomitable tramp The Little Fellow as millions came to call him was at once tatty and debonair browbeaten and irrepressibly optimisticand he was without question the bestloved international star in all of film history His coat was too small his pants too large his mustache patently falseand the resultant silhouette instantly recognizable wherever movies were shown Charlie Chaplins tramp spoke to all walks of lifeand never more eloquently than in such silent films as The Kid and The Gold Rush The Gold Rush is superb It deals with Charlies adventures to win the affection of a local dancehall girl and his hilarious efforts to avoid being eaten by bears and by prospectors who are bigger and hungrier than he The most memorable scene is one in which he dines on an old shoe Chaplins exquisite grace turned the boiled shoe into a gourmet feast he carves it carefully smacks his lips in anticipation and then eats it with gusto and appreciation sucking the nails as if they contained the most juices and twirling the laces around his fork as if they were spaghetti,10
184,tt0015864,In Charles Chaplins  film The Gold Rush a lone prospector travels to California looking for gold and entwines himself in adventures and finds Georgia the woman of his dreams After many hardships including a relocating cabin the lone prospector played by Charles Chaplin finds gold and becomes rich ending in success and unity with Georgia The time period in which this movie was shot compared with the technological innovation and the state of the art filming techniques give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel The use of upclose shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a new feel to the style of silent cinema The scene with the cabin shifting and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin was one of the many stylistic filming techniques that gave The Gold Rush such artistic and ingenious appeal Chaplins ideas and his vision that he brought to life in the movie The Gold Rush make it a great landmark in the beginning of silent films and in film history The intricate but simple story of The Gold Rush brought about many distinct feelings when viewing It gives feelings of happiness during scenes where there is comedic relief and slapstick comedy and also can bring about sadness or pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Years but she never shows up It reveals how silent films can become in touch with a persons feelings making them feel for the protagonist without having to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot These aspects of The Gold Rush make it a milestone in the film industry of the modern world,9
185,tt0015864,One of the best Chaplin movies which means one of the best movies ever made Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as `Eating the shoe and `The Roll Dance Both the original version and the second release have their own charm,10

187,tt0015864,We follow the little fellow Chaplin in his trip to Alaska to find gold  which he ends up succeeding in finding love at the same time The first half of the movie reunites Chaplin another lonesome gold seeker and a moralless scoundrel in a shelter under a particularly horrendous snowstorm There happens one of the most memorable scene of the movie Big Jims delusion that Chaplins is a giant of course bearing Chaplins manners chicken and his desperate attempts to eat him; but Chaplin is saved by a bear showing up which they finally eat Then parting their ways begins the second half of the movie the onesided romance with the beautiful Georgia met in a dance hall How funny was the scene when she invited out of despair our little fellow to dance to avoid dancing with an invading Jake! How genius showed Chaplin to use TchaykovskysBeauy &amp; the Beasts waltz!

Women love damned $$$,10
188,tt0015864,All the best Chaplin films have one unique scene thats very memorable because its either very funny or very touching In this film its one of the funny onesYou see in this film Chaplin jumps on the band wagon to Alaska to participate in the Gold Rush Along the way he runs into some crazy characters and has to stay out in the middle of nowhere with one of them Since they must try to survive in the cold weather Chaplin decides to cook dinner What he cooks and how they eat it is the priceless joke that makes this film so greatIts not just that one joke though there are tons of laughs in this great movie So I highly recommend it for any fan of silent films or comedies Youll have a lot of fun watching itAs of now this is the earliest Charlie Chaplin film that Ive seen but it probably wont be for long I think hes one of the greatest directors and I hope to see more of his films soon,10
189,tt0015864,THE GOLD RUSH United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations So proud of his achievement Chaplin reissued this silent film in  with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself eliminating the use of title cards Then in the summer of  THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting stations week series of The Silent Years as hosted by Orson Welles from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William PerryTHE GOLD RUSH which is set in the turn of the century opens with The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin coming to Alaska A snow storm drives him into the cabin of Black Lawson Tom Murray an outlaw Big Jim McKay Mack Swain another prospector who has found gold on his claim is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin After much struggle Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests Stranded due to the heavy storm Larson finds himself chosen to go out for help While out in the storm he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him He gets away by stealing their dog sled but is later killed in an avalanche Back to the cabin Charlie and Larson almost in near starvation eventually make a meal out of a large bear When the snow storm finally subsides the two men go about their separate ways Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia Georgia Hale a dance hall girl causing jealousy from her suitor Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite As for Jim he has forgotten where his gold claim is and locates Charlie to help him find it separating him from Georgia The results that follow is classic ChaplinAside from a large list of supporting players which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis The Gold Rush contains many now classic comedy supplements including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlies encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement There are tender moments too including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Years Eve dinner with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for themWith THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplins most revived and discussed movie one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed including THE CIRCUS  CITY LIGHTS  MODERN TIMES  and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR  Since the advent of home video in the early s THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores ranging from the use of piano organ or orchestra There are even some editions that have no music track at all along with some copies running different time lengths and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout The  reissue being a shorter print with Chaplins narration not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics but can also be found on Chaplins th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a  comedy short PAY DAY Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection But in spite of numerous editions THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics  and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter  reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector avid lip readers will notice that he is called Charlie by his supporting players especially by Georgia ****,10
190,tt0015864,If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability t you a commend this film as well as City Lights  Modern Times isnt strictly speaking a silent film although Chaplin had no dialogue there  The Gold Rush while not Chaplins best film does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits it must be seen  Excellent film   version redone by Chaplin is a bit better but either will do  Most highly recommended,10
191,tt0015864,To be perfectly honest I wish I could denounce Chaplin more fervently than I find myself able to Right down to my fundamental worldview I am a Buster Keaton person the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness The world as I understand it just doesnt work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay So wishing it did only fosters more painThis is actually worst than The Kid in this respect Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold Oh though filthy rich at that point when in the end he falls practically in the girls arms he is again dressed like a tramp  meaning no doubt he is still the same person  but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul here he gets both There is not even the thought of a compromiseYet I cant help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplins cosmology; the mysterious elusive fates  seemingly random but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose  that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocksNowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside the reality thought to be known understood domesticated into order but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void So every step inside taken casually without much thought is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death Blissful ignorance the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabinIt is a powerful cosmologic symbol what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life With both gold and love impossible love with the dream girl as the chimeras that trick the mindSo Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside but either cannot properly understand – and confuses karma for providential fate  or he does is terrified and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy taleSo however wellmeant its a dishonest patronizing vision of bliss Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging but eventually benevolent whims of providence Its all made right again more than rightNotice how well integrated is this notion inside the film proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the pointofview of the tramp who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger souldefining mechanisms that shape his life that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lessonSo instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill just wait and itll all work out in the end It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the filmSure it is occasionally very funny inventive But were talking here about the more intricate mechanisms that drive a film  and film aspiring to be a truthful reflection of life life itself,0
192,tt0015864,This is the first silent film I have ever seen so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound other than the piano in the background in a  minute movie So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas acrossI felt like they did some of same gags over and over again like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove It just got really old to me quickly I dont know maybe because Im from a different time period and way life but the film just didnt do anything for me I didnt really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only  to  minutes long and nothing would have been lost,3
193,tt0015864,Make them laugh make them laugh The American comic tradition and American movies were made for each other Gold Rush is one example that Charlie Chaplin was the father of American comedy Even though Chaplin loves to press political economical or social messages in his films The Gold Rush remains true to its genre It is a comedy non the less Even at the end of the film when THE TRAMP receives a kiss Chaplin reminds the audience that she has ruined the picture with the kiss This is suppose to be a comedy!,9
194,tt0015864,Spoilers hereinI consider `City Lights to be a masterwork one of the films that every literate person must see This film is often equally celebrated but it seems to be a random collection of integrated ideas to me Some work most dontThe  rescore and voiceover is much tighter visually but sonicly heavy If you have a chance with the DVD see it in the  recut with no sound and subtitlesThe one skit that works the best is the famous dancing rolls bit You really must see three versions of this one after another Look at the original Then see the Robert Downey Jr version done in  almost  years later Notice how much more comic Downeys is because he uses a different timing and is both doing it and referencing the Chaplin dance Then see the Johnny Depp version of the year later which pokes fun at the Downey version and reannotates the original A work of genius overlain on a masterpieceOtherwise there are better silent comedies to see And better ChaplinTeds Evaluation   of  Has some interesting elements,0
195,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is a showcase of sorts for Chaplin In it he provides audiences with a wide range of cinematic elements from his signature slapstick routines to dramatic relationships The rags to riches plot was interesting and witty but felt dragged out While Chaplin is good at emotionally engaging the audience with relateable situations like getting stood up or competing for a woman the lack of serious conflict makes the film seem simple The special effects were handled nicely even by todays standards but the true enjoyment in the film comes from watching the tramp endure hardship as he accidentally progresses into wealthiness and sees his life fall together by favorable coincidence,6
196,tt0015864,Spoiler AlertThe Gold Rush is perhaps one of the best silent movies I have ever seenAlthough it takes a bit to get used to silent movie language youll be rewarded with a marvelousfunny and poignant movieSome of the scenes are hilarious and some really touches your heartstrings Chaplin as performer gives one of his best performances in this movie There are plenty of great scenesChaplin and Mack Swain in the cabincrazy with hunger and cabin feverthe touching New Years Eve party and finally the hilarious finale with the cabin out on the edge of a cliffThe later version which was released with added narration and music wasnt as good as the originalbut easier for modern audiences to watch,8
197,tt0015864,What a delightful film I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them like the eating shoe scene fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Years Eve knowing that he was stoodup I genuinely felt for him Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time Brilliant,10
198,tt0015864,The primitive production values the decrepitlooking camera work and the silent soundtrack with only musical scores to suffice for the lack of the talkie in that era does little to ruin the viewers chance of being entertained by this highly enjoyable classic masterpiece by Charlie Chaplin The Little Tramp finds himself in the Yukon braving the wintery elements bears and a psychopath all for the sake of claiming his own fortune of gold Under his expert direction Chaplin guides THE GOLD RUSH with painstaking detail of what life would be like to live in the freezing extremes having to shack up in a  cabin in danger of toppling over a snowcapped cliff and feasting on shoes for protein Amidst all the atrocities Chaplin being that likeable underdog that everybody roots for and loves overcomes the odds managing to make the best out of a bad read terrible situation He even takes the time to humor himself and a few ladies with a songanddance number involving two forks and a pair of potatoes,0
199,tt0015864,The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights?  There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator  There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramps world City Lights falls short  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what Charlot has been all about all along It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplins works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime  out of ,10
200,tt0017136,Technically speaking I have seen this Fritz Lang silent scifi before but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the s The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable apocalyptic fantasy and religious allegory It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers who toil in the depths tending the machines and the upper classes who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers The hero the idle pampered son of the citys supervisor Joh Fredersen changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria the Madonna of the workers His father meanwhile is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didnt see In addition to restoring scenes to the film the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version With these changes the story becomes much clearer particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis Perhaps most importantly a whole new subplot is added involving the heros dead mother Hel who was loved by both his father and Rotwang With this clarification of the backstory the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer In some ways it recalls the family backstory of the Star Wars movies Of course the real strength of Metropolis isnt the story which is pretty silly and probably wouldnt have worked in anything but a silent film but its amazing visuals which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to  and Blade Runner Actually though in most respects silent films now look primitive one area in which they have the edge over modern filmmaking is in their frequently grandiose production design Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world The models of the citys towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a s film Even beyond the expansive production design and for the time special effects Langs visuals are all consistently inventive The robot Maria provides some of the movies most iconic images including her transformation into a human being In a later scene she performs for upperclass men in a nightclub and as she performs a striptease that in s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs A sign of Langs visual lavishness and the studios that he doesnt hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a characters state of mind For instance when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idols head into which the workers are being sacrificed At another point while hes sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs labor parable and Lang gives us spectacular images of the towers construction and fall In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and overliteral but theyre what silent cinema does best tell a story without the advantage or obstacle of dialogue The story is a little slow to start but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that Ive seen In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films as the workers riot and sabotage the machines endangering the entire city Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than  years,9
201,tt0017136,Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the s? Sure some science fiction movies are huge today such as George Lucas latest goofy Star Wars movie but in  Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then And sure enough we went right ahead living the way we were living the population got bigger and more crowded and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society Metropolis was run by his father John Frederson the master of Metropolis He lives in a Pleasure Garden high above the level of the workers and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father given the terrible conditions under which they live and work Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic sinister looking machine The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devillooking monster  After countless workers are consumed by it no wonder this was Hitlers favorite film they are immediately replaced by other workers who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements If some of these scenes men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured and the rest of the workers keep right on working hardly even noticingThe way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated `Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups is a saying that doesnt necessarily only apply to stupid people as Metropolis suggests Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue and the result is still compelling today The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways except that the two films can hardly be compared  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least An excellent film Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten,10
202,tt0017136,I doubt that Id ever seen anything resembling a complete version of METROPOLIS before though certain of its scenes were familiar to me if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keatons HEAVEN   In any case whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration  I expected to be distracted by the restorations technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it  As exaggerated as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards some performances such as the Master of the city are amazingly nuanced and layered and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone The meticulous design of the film the unerring camera placement and Langs muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking Id thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity important = dull but now Ive come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been,10
203,tt0017136,Fritz Langs Metropolis is the first true masterpiece of science fiction in film You can see its influence in films such as Star Wars The Matrix Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Blade Runner and countless others Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were in some cases phenomenal I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is  years old because a lot has happened in film since then Yet if you look at the basic elements of this movie  its story characters artwork cinematography etc I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late s Also take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this The performances and set designs are going to be over the top That was part of the style Metropolis may not be for everyone but for those willing to read between the lines this film still has a lot to offer!,8
204,tt0017136,In the future the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes the workers who live in the underground below the machines level and the dominant classes that lives on the surface The workers are controlled by their leader Maria Brigitte Helm who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles Maria meets Freder Fredersen Gustav Fröhlich the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen Alfred Abel in a meeting of the workers and they fall in love for each other Meanwhile Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate themMetropolis is a fantastic futuristic view of the fight of classes When Metropolis was shot it was a romantic revolutionary period of mankind history with socialist movements around the world Fritz Lang directed and wrote the screenplay of this masterpiece certainly inspired in this historical moment and defending a position of agreement and understanding between both sides showing that they need each other I wonder how this great director was able to produce such special effects in  with very primitive cameras and equipment The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art My vote is tenTitle Brazil MetropolisNote On  March  I saw this film again on BluRay,10
205,tt0017136,Metropolis is surely one of the greatest films ever made  Its scope its reach its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by todays standards of filmmaking  Seen in context of its premier in  Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history  Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great and in particular Metropolis  A great film is one that stirs the imagination leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life and achieves a kind of immortality  Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria  Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings halluciatory scenes and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions  There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria  Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups  Lastly Metropolis has stood the test of time  It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre  The story itself is simplea Biblical allegory about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen  The film is anything but simple  It is immense and a rich legacy that director Fritz Lang has left us,0
206,tt0017136,I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie This is without a doubt the best scifi movie Ive ever seen! Let me explain my position We have all seen modern scifi movies and argued over which is the best ever made but those film makers have high speed film and computers Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in  and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must see for all persons interested in the history of film as well as just good fun for everyone The social metaphores as well as the religious and philosophical double meanings are a sight to behold,10
207,tt0017136,This must be one of the greatest movies of all time I found myself almost in a state of shock during the whole movie Everything was perfect The story was great the filming was pure genius and the effects directly from another dimensionI dont think any movie after this one have gotten so much out of the available effects of the time as this one Nowadays they have super computers generating special effects Sure they look good but its no big deal making them Back in  computers werent even invented yet all effects had to be done by hand or in simple editing And when you take a look at all the thins that have been done in this movie its impossible not to get impressed Huge buildings explosions flooding picture phones however did he come up with the very idea? transformation sequences robots and so on No movie has ever pulled the limits of special effects as much as this one Star Wars and Jurassic Park are also known as limit pullers in special effects but they dont even come closeThen you have the filming Everything is perfect The use of body language is tremendous the light setting perfect everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera Ive never been witness to such a treat in filming other placesAnd the story!!! Perfect in every detail Intriguing exciting and thrilling with lots of religious undertones and tyranic leaders No wonder Hitler liked this movieI dont know how the original music of the film was but the new music for the restored  minute version I saw was really good and moodsetingAll in all This is one of the most perfect movies of all time and it deserves anything it can get Never has a / been as secure as for this movie,10
208,tt0017136,Silent movies are not for everyone Neither are subtitles Those brave enough to view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between should definitely enjoy this silent masterpiece One of the biggest productions of its time Metropolis still holds its own when set design and special effects are compared But what Metropolis really has is orginality This GermanExpressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future modern city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern scifi Star Warss CPO was based on Bridgette Helms robot Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis lookalike cities This is a very good movie Its too bad most movies dont have its originality,9
209,tt0017136,Fritz Langs groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema How can a movie thatll soon turn  years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages The world has been divided into two main categories thinkers &amp; workers! If you belong to the first category you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if youre a worker your life isnt worth a penny and youre doomed to perilous labor underground The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself Its essential viewing anyway! Metropolis is a very demanding filmexperience and definitely not always entertaining But as it is often the case with silentcinema classics the respect and admiration youll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoymentaspect Fritz brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to recreate a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines Many supposedly restored versions have been released over the years in  and  for example but the version is still the finest in my opinion even though that one already isnt as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it Metropolis perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made  A Space Odyssey Star Wars and Blade Runner owe their existence or at least their power to it,8
210,tt0017136,Metropolis is my alltime favourite movie so Ive saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb Ive enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies Ive seen but now Im moving on to other passionsAlthough written by Fritz Langs wife Thea von Harbou Metropolis was originally Langs idea he was inspired by the sight of New Yorks skyscrapers when he sailed to America in  During his American trip he visited the set of The Phantom of the Opera and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasnt filmedDespite its epic power Metropolis makes very little sense The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen so why is the one named Freder*sen* the father not son of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwangs crude little cottage the only preFredersen building that wasnt demolished during the construction of this city? Von Harbous very long and unwieldy novelisation of her script establishes this fact but never explains it How and why did Rotwangs hightech laboratory manage to get constructed BENEATH that cottage without disturbing it?For modern viewers some of the plots incoherence can be blamed on missing footage particularly in American prints The distributors for this films original Stateside release commissioned playwright Channing Pollock to translate the German titles A major subplot of the backstory features a deceased woman named Hel who was married to Rotwang but left him to marry Fredersen and give birth to Freder This unseen womans name could not easily be changed for the American version due to a couple of shots of her memorial engraved with the Teutonic name HEL Apparently Pollock feared that American viewers would be offended by this words similarity to Hell so he simply excised the entire subplot from this long movieThe reallife drama on the set of Metropolis mustve been quite interesting in itself Mad scientist Rotwang alias Doctor Strangeglove is played by actor Rudolf KleinRogge who had been married to scenarist von Harbou before she left him to marry Fritz Lang the mastermind of this film In Metropolis Rotwangs wife left him to marry the master of Metropolis Id love to know how KleinRogge felt about the fact that his reallife marital and sexual situation was the inspiration for key plot elements of this movie  and I wonder how KleinRogge felt about knowing that the entire cast and crew knew this as wellMost astonishing about this gargantuan production is the fact that nearly all of Metropolis was actually built to scale with just a couple of miniaturesTrivia tidbit actress Brigitte Helm was cast in the dual female role largely because she was flatchested and therefore she could easily fit inside the mechanical suit for the Robotrix A more busty actress would have suffered constant discomfort inside those galvanised bosoms of the metal costume I learnt this more than  years ago from an eldery Austrian stagehand who worked on the filmFor all its flaws Metropolis will always be my favourite movie Ive enjoyed writing all these reviews for IMDb The joy of posting my reviews on this site has brought me many friendships and a few enemies Well you cant win em allNitrate film stock doesnt last forever and all good things come to a happy ending This is my last review here Ill keep watching movies but other passions are important to me as well Thank you IMDb and thank you to everyone who has read my reviews I will happily rate Metropolis a full  out of ,10
211,tt0017136,One definitely cant fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Langs vision even if as always with depictions of the future there are a few forgivable blind spots The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the s as are the flyingmachines that buzz about them; while the business dress of tomorrows rulers unlike their exotic leisure wear doesnt appear to have advanced one iota!HGWells criticised the film for its adherence to arty image over scientific rigour and as a piece of coherent science fiction its certainly as lacking as he claimed The machines exist to appear awesome and to torment their workers rather than to perform any apparent task and there is no explanation of how this society functions how it evolved or how it is sustained let alone of the incongruities that must surely lie behind such anomalous locations as the catacombs and the cathedral But Wells own futuristic film Things to Come conceived in direct riposte to Langs unscientific approach is tedious and talky as a result didactic in its heavyfooted philosophy and explanations and lacking in artistic vision Metropolis may be soft SF but its approach undoubtedly makes for better cinemaI am not however impressed by it as a film Masterpiece of Modernism it may be  but great design and special effects cant save todays bigbudget clunkers from deficiencies of character and plot and they dont save this one Ironically I suspect that its reputation has benefited greatly from its being the only silent film many of its viewers have ever encountered reading through the IMDb pages I see wellmeaning comments like Great  when you consider how primitive cinema was in  and once you get used to the fact that it takes about ten gestures to convey one sentence It wasnt  and it doesnt!As silent films go this is in many places agonizingly slow and repetitious marred by clumsy acting tendentious titles and overwrought gestures By the late s cinema had progressed far beyond this laboured pantomime in Langs case the heavy stylisation may have been a deliberate choice but compared to the fluidity of contemporaries such as Sjostroms The Wind or The Scarlet Letter Asquiths Underground or Shooting Stars and Murnaus Sunrise the film comes across as ten years behind the times The problem is not necessarily with the actors  Brigitte Helm as has been observed does an excellent job in differentiating her two characters  but with the direction and pacingWe saw the restored version with the original Gottfried Huppertz score; the latter didnt always seem to fit too well with pops jumps and awkward silences but this was I assume due either to the difficulty of fitting it to allow for the missing material or to problems in the projection booth when running a newlyarrived print for the first time However the painstaking summary of the various missing scenes only ended up increasing my appreciation of what a good job had been done in the editingdown in the first place! To take a single example where the edited version conveys Freders sudden recollection that he is supposed to be the workers longawaited mediator via the simple juxtaposition of three shots  the shiftchange whistle announcing the meeting the catacombs and Freder suddenly struck by an idea and rushing off  the restoration betrays the fact that a couple of scenes of mimed dialogue were originally provided to spell out the message at painstaking lengthIt is interesting to see how it was done but most of the cuts are either an improvement or a very clever abridgement and by and large I didnt feel that what was omitted had been any great loss In fact frankly I felt that the film was in need of further editing at certain points such as Rotwangs pursuit of Maria through the catacombs She screams and runs and screams and runs and is pursued by a searchlight effect; its clever selfconsciously clever the first couple of times but the repetition becomes tedious to the point of caricature Plot infelicities abound in increasing numbers culminating in the infamous Hunchback of Notre Damestyle ending where the mad scientist carries off the girl across the roof of the cathedral hotly pursued by Our Hero which raised giggles in a hitherto serious and respectful audience with which I couldnt help but sympathiseThis is a film to see once in a lifetime so that you can say that you have seen it  not least because most of the impact lies in the visuals But its all surface and no substance the characters act arbitrarily the plot is subservient to the Message the pacing is like treacle the storytelling technique is primitive and really all it has going for it is the visual flair and the special effects I quite honestly believe that this work would be better appreciated as a set of stills in a glossy brochure; an exhibit in a design exhibition This is not cinema as I love it  its innovative it may be Art but as an actual film its only a poor shadow,6
212,tt0017136,There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator This is the predominant theme of Metropolis and director Fritz Lang finds numerous ways to say and visualize his message during the course of the film The movie relies on repeated visual imagery to make its point and does so effectively even if tedious at times Particularly effective is the representation of the worker society as an almost single living unit moving trance like to their appointed time and task The use of a ten hour clock in the workers chamber constantly draws our attention as does the hangdog posture of the individual slaves who grind out their workday as if in a dazeAmid this rabble worker Maria Brigitte Helm is the inspirational voice of the workers offering hope for a brighter future by a mediator yet to appear However the Master of Metropolis John Frederson Alfred Abel sees in her a way to quell the underlying frustration of the workers commissioning his scientist Rotwang to create a robot Maria to plant discord among the workers Rotwangs laboratory would have done Frankenstein proud and the creation of the robot is a marvel of cinematic imagery The robot Marias belly dance transforms into a scene of such raw energy and sexual awareness that it awakens the statues of the Seven Deadly Sins one of the master strokes of this expressionist filmSo much imagery in fact is layered into Metropolis that its safe to say that repeat viewings will lead to even more interpretations of its vision and not simply for its denunciation of a class society Both timely and timeless the film captures a dynamism that inspires passion even after nearly eighty years following its original release,8
213,tt0017136,I really hate it when I dont enjoy a classic film I really want to enjoy it but I just cant I want to understand some peoples love for it but I just cant Metropolis falls under this category An unbearably slow film I watched the restoration which is over  hours longthat may have been a bad idea that starts off with interesting ideas but then seems to not really do much with them It is the year  the wealthy rule the city of Metropolis while the lowerclass work for hours on end underground in awful conditions The Master of Metropolis is Joh Fredersen Alfred Abel and his son is Freder Gustav Frohlich who spends his days with other rich people in a place called the pleasure garden where he truly does nothing at all A woman named Maria Brigitte Helm brings a group of working children up for a visit in pleasure garden and Freder is quickly enamored by Maria Freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shocked as an explosion goes off and kills multiple workers He reports this to his father who is disappointed his son was the first to report it over his assistant Josepha Theodor Loos and his assistant is quickly fired This does an immediate job of showing the coldness of Joh but they never do much else with his character In fact very little of the characters are developed in anyway Most of them are completely uninteresting and the setting itself is compelling at first but quickly loses anything interesting halfway through the film as the film moves at a snail pace Anyways the main aspect of the plot here is that the workers are led by Maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of a mediator to make it happen My real issue is that the film starts with such a great idea and had potential to become something like  Im aware it came out afterwords and that its a novel but still just an example but it instead becomes filled with strange religious allusions and becomes a witch hunt essentially by the end They never really do any decent social commentary at all If any at all This wouldnt matter if the film was actually entertaining but it only is in spurts and then quickly becomes a repetitive bore I do think the special effects were impressive and this film is obviously important for being the first full length science fiction filmwell ever That doesnt mean it holds up because it doesnt In fact itd be hard for me to believe the film was entertaining in  I still wonder if I had watched the shorter version of the film how much more I wouldve enjoyed the film It certainly wouldve have been paced better considering so much of this film is unbelievably uninteresting But I dont think that changes the fact that this movie doesnt really do anything It isnt entertaining It doesnt really have a message What is this movie? I guess good special effects for ? Whatever Im glad I gave this classic a chance but I highly doubt Ill revisit it anytime soon,4
214,tt0017136,This review contains Spoilers But since the story is by far the least reason to watch Metropolis feel free to still read it even if you havent watched it yetMetropolis is a film that was far ahead of its time It influenced a great lot of sciencefiction films and how The Blade Runner Batman or Dark City would look like if there wasnt Metropolis  who knows Even The Matrix Reloaded is heavily inspired by this classic that is as old as my grandmother Now what is it all about? About Freder the son of the head of the city of Metropolis a Christlike figure who falls in love with the preacher of the working class a saintlike woman who happens to be named Maria When a robot who is modeled to look like Maria makes the workers almost extinguish their city and their children Maria and Freder save the children and in the end Freder makes his father and the workers cooperate for a brighter futureSounds silly to you? Yes and thats exactly what the story is silly Thats also the reason why still today Metropolis isnt accepted as the masterpiece it is by a few film buffs But these people dont understand one thing A good film does more than only tell a story A film can be great even without a story at all and a silly story combined with amazing visuals can make you forget all the other weaknesses a film has And wow what amazing images Metropolis offers What an art direction! What wonderful special effects! And remember as I already said this film is as old as my grandmother! Just have a look at the workers They hardly ever seem to be individuals In the mass scenes they look like one big creature moving forward or backwards When they are working they look more like machines than like human beings whereas the machines resemble monsters more than they do technical devices best seen in the moments when Freder hallucinates and sees the big machine as a workereating Moloch We also see a worker and later Freder work on a machine that looks like a clock with  blinking light bulbs doing some that looks as exhausting as it looks senseless Or think of Rotwang the mad inventor who lives in a little hut that looks in this film like it was from another world He has a black prosthesis for his right hand its not a coincidence that Stanley Kubrick gave his mad scientist/inventor Dr Strangelove a prosthesis for his right hand too He builds the robot that he makes to look like Maria and that transformation scene is one of the most magnificent scenes ever and looks more convincing than some scenes of modern scifi flicks I also have to mention Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and the robot  and the look in her eyes would already be enough to tell which of her characters is on screen at the moment If something like awards already would have been given in the s she sure would have walked home with quite a bunch of them And just look at her sexy dance! It is just as memorable as the shot of the many eyes watching her dance  or the many faces watching her preach just a few minutes later Metropolis is a film no scififan should miss I had the good luck that my first viewing of Metropolis one year ago was in a cinema when it was a rereleased after its restoration I can only recommend you to watch it in a cinema if you have the possibility to as Metropolis is just as   A Space Odyssey one of those rare films that are masterpieces on your TV set but a revelation on the big screen,10
215,tt0017136,I was very anxious to see Metropolis for the first time I had been into silent movies for a couple of years but hadnt had the opportunity to see Fritz Langs classic I finally saw it at a silent movie theater in Hollywood and my feelings were to say the least mixedThe film is visually stunning Monumental sets brilliantly directed scenes amazing special effects by the standards of the time In fact I might say that I was more enthralled by the visual effects of this movie than I was by say Lord of the Rings or Avatar Whereas Cameron and Jackson used CGI to make their visions come true; Lang had to use camera trickery paint and woodThis movie no doubt set the lexicon for the SciFi and blockbuster genre in stone The images of Metropolis have been repeated in innumerable movies The scene of the underground city being flooded has curious similarities to James Camerons Titanic Even the villainous Rotwang can be seen in the characters Dr Strangelove and Doc Brown from Back to the FutureBut then theres the story And the dialogue And the acting which is overwrought even by the standards of the time But I dont have enough room to go into thatStarting with the opening line LookThese are your brothers a violent cringe would run through my body every time the intertitles would appearThe later line about the head and hands needing the heart as mediator caused a huge outburst of laughter in the theater This serves as the basis for the moral of the story which was eerily similar to How the Grinch Stole Christmas Essentially it can boiled down to this Somebody according to writer Thea von Harbous later beliefs this turned out to be Adolf Hitler needs to appeal to the hearts of capitalist managers and tell them to be nice to their workers The outcome is a grudging handshake between the head manager Joh Frederson and the leader of the workers Grot; and thus begins a shining new day!Metropolis also incorporates religious symbolism which is to say the very least heavyhanded Scenes of the Seven Deadly Sins The Tower of Babel an altar to Moloch and the Flood all warn of doom to decadent societies that exploit the weak and kill the righteousIn the end this muddled mixture of Socialist calls for justice and Christian Apocalypticism creates a political message that Lang himself described as sillyI recommend this film for its artistic brilliance and groundbreaking techniques But dont go into this expecting an award quality filmIf you want to get into silent film this is a relatively easy one to get start with However I dont know if thats a good or a bad thing Ive met too many people whove said that Metropolis was the best silent movie theyve ever seen; which probably means that it was the only one that they ever bothered to watch I would recommend Sunrise or City Lights as a first over this,5
216,tt0017136,Francis Ford Coppola once said that Apocalypse Now wasnt just about Vietnam is was Vietnam In a similar way Metropolis isnt just about the Twentieth Century it is the Twentieth Century Almost every image in it reflects or more often predicts the realities of life in the West over the past hundred years in a way that is truly uncannyFrom small details  the traffic jams and blackouts that plague city dwellers  to major historical events  the climactic flood predicts every industrial disaster that has destroyed the lives of thousands of workers from Chernobyl to the Bhopal disaster whilst Fredersens vision of workers being fed to Moloch cant help but bring to mind the holocaust  Metropolis feels prescient in any number of ways In the image of the Manhattan skyline Lang really did find the perfect symbol of the coming century  progressive new faceless oppressiveThis is far from the simple Marxist fable it is often taken for  although the Socialist message can hardly be ignored Its also a Christian parable Maria flanked by crosses is counterbalanced by the Machine brought to life under a pentagram informed by the book of Revelation; a retelling of the Orpheus myth with Freder as Orpheus and Maria as Eurydice lost in the underworld; and a Kafkaesque nightmare of depersonalisation although the Gothic expressionistic production design is a long way from Kafkas more sterile styleIts also lest we forget a silly adventuremelodrama with a mad scientist an evil twin a bad father with a noble son and an impossibly virtuous idealised heroine In many ways it anticipates Star Wars in dressing up mythic standards with Science Fiction tropes  with Fredersen as the misguided King Freder as the handsome Prince Maria the goodhearted peasants daughter Rotwang as a scheming sorcerer and the Machine as the wicked witch appropriately burnt at the stake by the villagersThe MachineMan a confusing name for a construction so obviously feminine is the single most indelible image of the film; the scene in which Rotwang brings her to life for the first time is a real moment of magic and awe untarnished by eighty subsequent years of cinematic showmanship Even better is the scene in which she becomes a duplicate of Maria  such an obvious influence on James Whales Frankenstein that its hard not to shout out Its alive! The optical effects are years ahead of their time certainly the best of their kind until the sixties at least It also marks the beginning of Brigitte Helms truly extraordinary turn as the false MariaThis is only the third silent film Ive seen after Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and its taken me a while to acclimatise to the acting style which can seem close to parody What it really reminds me of however is modern dance which similarly seeks to communicate with the audience visually rather than verbally Metropolis encourages this comparison with the highly choreographed movements of the workers operating the machinery Bearing this in mind Helm is hugely impressive in multiple roles Maria could be a rather dull and virtuous heroine she enters the film surrounded by poor children in rags but Helm invests her with enormous energy and expressiveness It helps that the script allows her to take an unusually proactive role for a female character organising workers meetings and racing to the rescue of the endangered children However it is her performance as bad Maria vamping up a storm that lingers in the memory  the twitching jerking movements of her head and body the Anne Robinson style halfwink that changes the shape of her face that malicious little grin that makes it hard not to root for her mischief The entirely weird erotic dance that she performs isnt technically very good or erotic but it is utterly unforgettable Subtextually shes the Whore of BabylonThe other performances are mainly very good particularly Alfred Abel as Fredersen proving that it is possible to underplay in a silent film Only Rudolf KleinRogge hits any wrong notes  difficult as it undoubtedly must be to play a mad scientist in a silent film with subtlety some of his more unrestrained gesticulations leave you worried about the safety of the other actorsUltimately though it all inevitably comes back to the imagery Langs film remains unmatched even today Pick a scene any scene  the synchronised shuffling crowds at the shift change; our first sighting of the Metropolis all biplanes skyscrapers and suspended motorways; the vision of Moloch; the MachineMan awakening; Maria pursued along a pitchblack tunnel by a beam of light; the statue of Death coming to life in the Cathedral; disembodied eyes entranced by the twitching false Maria; the crowds swarming up the steps in the Tower of Babel section; the lifts crashing down one by one; desperate children crowding around Maria as the floodwaters close in; and most of all false Maria laughing as she burns on her pyre then transforming back to her metal visage No film before or since matches this for spectacle And if in order to appreciate it you have to swallow a little treacle about the heart being the mediator between head and hands well trust me its worth it,9
217,tt0017136,We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Langs Metropolis are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upperclass and operated by slavelike poor The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan These elements can be found in this films ancestors Frankenstein Batman Gattaca and the cities of Blade Runner Star Wars and The Fifth Element All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Langs workMetropolis has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes After its success in  the film has had an uneasy time Its pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in  Unless a lost version surfaces as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentinos  film Beyond the Rocks the complete work my never be seen again The restored version released on DVD in  was based on a digital restoration at K resolution from all available sources Its the best version that Ive seen and I would highly recommend that one if you havent seen the film The worst is a  print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration the film in grainy and difficult to see it doesnt even have a soundtrack I call that one the worst because Im still a little ambivalent about the  restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting good sound effects not so good and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy Freddy Mercury Bonnie Tyler Adam Ant and Pat Benatar yuck!Those who study the film myself included find the story impenetrable Some films you can easily decipher but Metropolis has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that its hard to pin it down as a whole Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the films chaotic nature It takes place in the future restored versions offer title cards that suggest that its the year  but I dont go by that in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers the Gothic sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives dancing in their penthouses and spending their money The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step They dont so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses slaves building his pyramids The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another One person that isnt ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his officeHis son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the workers children Curious he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there The woman is Maria a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be foundFreder uncovers a plot by Rotwang the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms This leads to the films most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzyThen all Hell breaks loose but the rest I must leave to you to discoverLang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film and therefore less successful the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers At one point Freder disguised as a worker witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen Another suggests an odd device a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around its edge The machine doesnt seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless dayThe film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism astonishing in its use of light and shadow One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in Another brilliant moment comes with Marias erotic dance as the men gawk the camera filled with their moist eyes This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home videoOther moments have deeper resonance There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves Walking to work they march with their heads down dressed in uniforms and caps It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler More obvious are Langs biblical references The rise of the city parallels Marias retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel The giant pentagram in Rotwangs lab as he plays God The breathtaking image of the plaguebringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself There is even a Christlike quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakersThese elements and images are brought to the film because of Langs insistence on no less then absolute perfection He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster working his cast and crew like a dictator He cast some  extras  of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone and worked them from morning till night The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with himI could go on and on this film all great films invite lengthy discussions It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over But when you get down to it the best way to view Metropolis is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of its time Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad,0
218,tt0017136,This truly is a classic masterpiece and honestly one of the best movies ever made The story is brilliant and the visuals amazingI have seen the German  minutes version of the movie without subtitles Yes its a long watch but its worth every second of it Basically only reason why the movie is so long is because they need about ten hand gestures to speak one sentence Its kind of dreadful to look at first but once youre used to it it shouldnt trouble you anymoreIn many ways this movie can be regarded as the Blade Runner of the s Metropolis is set in a futuristic world that has a same kind of atmosphere as in Blade Runner The mix of s cars and propellerplanes with futuristic machines highways buildings and androids is very unusual but an absolutely awesome thing to look at The movie was ahead of its time and in some ways also propheticThe story is absolutely the best thing of the movie Also the way the story is told and directed by Fritz Lang deserves credit The story is tense and has quite some symbolism layers and storylines but remains always easy to follow The ending is truly spectacular and tense The way how spectacular and tense the ending and the entire movie in general was really surprised me in a positive wayThe sets are obviously fake and miniatures at times but they still manage to convince and impress Further more the movie is filled with some fantastic and very convincing early special effectsMan who also deserves credit is Alfred Abel Wow what a great actor he was in this movieAn absolute must see and one of the best movies of all time/http//bobafettblogspotcom/,10
219,tt0017136,MetropolisMetropolis is one of the most exciting and exceptional works of art that humankind has produced This epic science fiction film is one of Germanys famous silent movies created by Fritz Lang and liberated in  the period between the two World WarsThis movie represents the expressionist cinema and shows us the repression of human needs by the machine age Langs creation of a selfdestructive society is a protest against the machine age Metropolis is one of the most magnificent cities of  is kept alive by the unceasing work of the underground people who live in slavery and is enjoyed by wealthy and educated people The Austrian director of the movie Fritz Lang presents the story of a master John Federsen who sees people as machines working constantly to maintain the luxury and technology of his metropolis On the other side his son Freder falls in love with one of the underground workers who is a spiritual leader for the slaves The son recognizes the unsentimental heart of his father and starts a revolution The city gets flooded and Maria Freders love regains the workers trust after a robot had stolen her identity she finds her loved one after saving the citys children and the workers shake hands with the masterExpressionism tries to simplify the world and to understand it emotionally in a subjective way It is very important to understand this definition of this dynamic violent and distorted movement in order to understand that Lang tried to externalize his own internal vision of the world through simple expressions The name metropolis comes from the Greeks and means mothercity It has this significance because a metropolis is the biggest form of a technologically and economically developed city Nevertheless referring to the movie name this film can be considered as the mother city of all cinematic clichés In this story there are two main characters Maria and Freder These two characters are also the heroes of the story because they are the ones who rescue the population from being drowned in the flood John Federson is a person full of empowering feelings who only thinks of himself and of his city forgetting about the ones who work for him All the fantasies that he has come true through the power of his workers but he never thinks about the danger they are in while working for him This man wants so much power that he is almost hypnotized by it; he is obsessed and possessed by the power of inventions and creationsOn the other hand Maria is just a symbol of munificence her soul is pure and she is seen like an angel who brings peace to the world Maria convoys the people in a church settling area She is shown as sanctity a holy person that is surrounded by the light of the candles She is positioned higher than the workers who carefully listen to her as she speaks about peace unity and their salvation by a mediator that will soon come Her eyes inspire confidence and kindness as she kisses Freder in the church scene In general all she does is for the good of humanity One thing that she repeats in the movie is Between the head and hands there must be a heart  This means that she realizes the bad things that the head John Frederson does and the good things that the hands workers do But she knows that these workers should not be treated poorly or like robots and that she can be the heart which can persuade the head and the hands to cooperate to come to common interests Maria as her name suggests is also a biblical motif She explains to the workers the story of the Tower of Babel The workers in the story destroy this tower which parallels how the movie will end with the destruction of the machines by the workforce Maria is still the representation of Jesus mother because she is trying to save the lives of the underground children She would sacrifice herself and alike Mother Mary she has a strong faith in the creator of the world All the scenes of this film are perfectly created at the eye level so that anyone is able to view the action However there is also a birds eye view at the beginning of the movie as the panorama of the city is shown from high above the ground This view was created to give us an impression of how widely extended and huge Metropolis is In addition the focus of the dramatic camera angles with bold shadows is on the disproportioned landscape as well as on the rightangled buildings There are moments in which the camera focuses on fast movement scenes like the dancing of the robot in the nightclub and scenes where it focuses on slow movement like in the beginning of the film where the slaves are shown going into the working area at a certain pace and aligned as robots When more people are involved in a scene like the one in which all the children are surrounding Maria as she rings the danger bell the angles are vertical triangular but when only one person is focused there is a closeup to allow us to read that characters expressions and feelings A good example would be the closeups on the master Fredersons eyes as he asks his secretary why his son was allowed to go underground and as well after that scene when he is thinking in order to suggest this dictators meditation and frustration Another important aspect of the camera and of Expressionism that I have remarked was the scene in which the mad scientist tries to run away from Freder and kidnaps Maria He is walking up on the roof of a sharpangled building holding Maria under his arm as if nothing would happen The same scene was notable in Robert Wienes film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari as Cesare walks up on the roof with the kidnapped fiancé and the city crowd follows himTime also is significant in the film because the clock keeps showing up in the most important scenes Time is evident in Fredersons office as his son challenges him to have mercy for the people as well as he is talking to his secretary Still only a small portion of the clock is shown in these shots and it means the time in which the master can think what decisions to take On the other hand a gigantic clock is shown as Freder finds an exhausted worker trying to turn a wallclock Freder understands the struggle of this man and replaces him There is where he finds out that at  pm Maria will have a meetingBut all that we have seen in this movie is not only made to show us the great importance of this silent SF film that can keep the watcher alive by its impressive music and can inspire contemporary movies like Matrix  but for its great historical importance Fritz Lang expressed a social life in this movie as well as a political one After WWI when Germany had lost a war peoples lives were a disaster Everyone was disoriented and could not keep up with the tragedy that was going on and maybe there were some influences of the great antiSemitism that was supposed to follow But Germany was a great disaster as well and there was nothing it could have done to prevent it because many troubles kept adding up over the years and this country had to be defeated morally and politically as well as economically Even if Germanys wish of reconstruction was as utopic as Fredersens wish of a technological city the postwar inflation had a big contribution on cinemas development,0
220,tt0017136,I typically dont like silent films but I decided to watch this one for two reasons  First I usually like scifi movies and second Metropolis had received so many glowing reviews that I couldnt pass it up  However my opinion of this film is below what most reviewers have been sayingKinos digitally remastered version on DVD is very impressive  The sound and picture quality are both excellent  However I have to conclude that favorable reviews of this film are likely based on nostalgia on the films influence on future films and on the incredible visual effects given its year of release  Film history buffs and silent film fans should see this movie  I thought this was a good film but not a great one  A rating of  is much too high and at # there are plenty of better films ranked below itFirst the good parts of the film  The special effects are excellent for a pres film  The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work the decisions they make and in how easily they are led/misled  The main character is well developed throughout the film and the audience can relate to him well  The film is visually stunning and impressive  The story of the working class vision of the future machinemen etc have had a very strong influence on many films which came later,4
221,tt0017136,For its time this movie has stunning visuals kind of Kubrickesqe in appearance especially the opening scenes of workers going and coming from work Its very strange with the group leaving walking with their heads down like zombiesThe set designs in here are also something that might draw your attention This really has a futuristic look I thought the visuals were fascinating This was German expressionist filmwork at its height I would think Director Fritz Lang went on to become a very famous man in his profession This wasnt his first effort but I think this might have been the film that put him on the map so to speak Several years later he gained a lot more fame with M At any rate with the photography sets and overall Flash Gordontype scifi look this must have been a real eyeopener to movies viewers  years ago I still think they look very cool today The music was also very dramatic at least in this restored  surround sound restoration DVD put out by KlinoObviously the eye makeup on men and the exaggerated motions by actors in silent films look a little hokey but I was mesmerized by Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and her evil clone She is something else! I also appreciated Klinos explanation of lost footage and how they did the best they could do to still make the story flow together They did an outstanding job I wouldnt attempt to watch this on anything less than this DVD which looks pretty darn goodThis is a worker story about a man wanting to trade his comfortable life to join the oppressed workers who do their thing beneath the earth in Metropolis Workers are seen as nothing but replaceable robots If someone gets hurt they get carted away and replaced immediately but some other zombielike human Of course people being mistreated can only take it for so long before rebellion Thats history from the days of the Jewish slaves in Egypt to today so thats part of this story too I wont say more to ruin itI dont want to mislead people on one major point todays audiences watching this Few people in  watch silent movies To ask them to sit through two hours of a silent film is obviously asking a lot I had to break this up into several viewings myself but thats okay I still enjoyed itbut it a silent movie this long is not easy to sit through You have to be a student of film or a big film buff to watch thisbut those people will be rewarded Over  reviews in here show you this film has enough to offer or at least take a look Now that this restored version is available check it out!,7
222,tt0017136,OK first of all Im not some kind of actionjunkie who thinks that the Rambotrilogy is the best movies of all time I am a person who think that other silents like Nosferatu and The Battleship Potemkin are entertainingAlthough I loved the previous movies referred to I thought this was one of the most dull movies ever As entertainment this movie cant go very far On a scale rating its abilities to entertain it gets a / from meAs a milestone in the history of movies it goes all the way to the top The special effects were great to have been made almost  years ago The editing was great It must have been one of the most expensive movie made to that date On the scale of how important a chapter in the cinematic history this is I will rate it a / That means a total / This also means that you should rather check out really good silents like Chaplins Modern Times Eisensteins The Battleship Potemkin and Murnaus Nosferatu,8
223,tt0017136,Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium and his  opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format a fully restored print on the KINO DVD filled with intertitles to keep the story complete that had me appreciate it more but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music ie Giorgio Moroders experimental cut it would still be affecting At the core of the story Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou the sides of good vs evil or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak is set up so strongly that even when it has its fairytale type of heaviness to it it doesnt seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults This is the kind of film that should work for anyone young and old as it deals with universal themes ie The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!The story leaves room for the visual style to come through Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis Joh Frederson He feels the sorrow and pain of the people and goes down to their level to be one of them He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women Maria played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm in multiple roles she plays without a fault who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freders father Enter the robot a marvel of a mad scientist who gets transposed from Maria and becomes the havocwrecker of the part of Metropolis I wont reveal too much of the story except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lapAmidst in all of this Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects cameratricks and of course editing if I wouldnt quite rank Metropolis in my alltime top ten favorites I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day cars moving on roads built to the sky airplanes flying everywhich way and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways But its not just the use of the models or the sets or the backdrops or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Langs shots which are all spectacular its also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene it also appears in other scenes I think Its little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages the superimpositions of faces and eyes in the dreamlike shotsAnd of course Langs greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story he goes beyond his time period in stylizing As I mentioned with the pacing being unique it was surprising though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M that many of the suspense sequences mob scenes/riots chases I knew that this is the same kind of styling thats used today for many of the most modern of sciencefiction/action films In its own way much like Stanley Kubricks  Space Oddysey it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling while not completely abandoning the storytelling form Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries and it hasnt been seen in its full form in almost eighty years what remains doesnt seem at all dated or crude Quite the opposite its visual expressiveness its use of time and character and action and its deliberate pacing makes it ahead of its time and influential and at the same time keeping itself unique Its a tale were all familiar with being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial cruel world which Im sure was even more relevant to post WW Germany at the time filmed with a mix of overthetop melodrama megabudget setpieces and designs that confound the senses Add the appropriate music and youve got a classic fantasy A tremendous film to see two three a dozen times over though some of those too impatient for films without spoken words or by the operatic dramatic side of it all may become disappointed or frustrated,10
224,tt0017136,For many years the initially flopped and consequently butchered Metropolis Fritz Lang made in the mid twenties of the past century could be appreciated at least for its qualities as the indispensable sciencefiction trailblazer in motion picture history What was severely lacking from the plot however finally emerged on screen again after the famous Buenos Aires reel find which brought a quarter of what was missing from the film back from the dead With the new painstaking  restoration effort also came a grandiose symphony orchestra studio recording of the original Gottfried Huppertz score  and the results make movie buffs prone to be blown away and this time for realThe technical brilliance and visual lavishness of Fritz Langs oeuvre was always undisputed already at its time and only matched by fellow German Murnaus ingenious approaches on filmmaking Theres so much and dense imagery that generations of future filmmakers would draw from this newly emerging archetype Among the unforgettable scenes are the giant heart machine which turns into a moloch in one of the heros visions the Babel tower teeming with utopian life the enormous sets elevators and masses and masses of enslaved and rebellious people the staggering creation of the first robot all set against the dominant dichotomy between  literally  those living above and those dying below There are echoes of communism here of nazi ideology of the dangers and abysses of industrialization technology and there are also glimpses of humanity Not perfect in all its components the film nevertheless has everything pioneering in it  and more Fritz Lang while having some reservations himself referred to the picture as a signpost for new destinations and thats exactly what it became now that we can look at the great scifi pictures of the past century In them and through them Metropolis still lives and once we revisit the original again we might yet be surprised that it miraculously still points ahead,10
225,tt0017925,Probably Buster Keatons best film and oddly enough its not even a straightforward comedy  its actually an action film with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure  `The General which is set during the Civil War is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray Buster Keaton of course who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army    and is turned down because the army feels hed be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier  However through a series of misunderstandings both Johnnys family and his girl think hes a coward and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier  Months pass and Johnny sad and alone is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North  Johnnys efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girls love  become an unbelievably funny and actionpacked series of events as Johnny tries to go from being a sadsack buffoon to being a heroIf you havent watched many silent films they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive as hes fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye  While funny Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well  His timing whether for a joke or for a tender moment is absolutely impeccableWhats also great about `The General is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldnt be made today  No amount of insurance would cover it  Keaton does all his own stunts and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General with a bike he sits on a moving cattlecatcher knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own  All these stunts are fantastic but its scary to think that any one of these probably couldve killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong  ,9
226,tt0017925,Buster Keaton once said that if he hadnt been a comedian he might have been a civil engineer He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics Its no wonder he adored trains the most elegant of machines and brought them into his movies whenever he could When one of Keatons former gagwriters loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this page of history to life His first certainty was that the production had to be so authentic it hurts He even insisted on using historically accurate narrowgauge railroad tracks which he found along with appropriate landscapes near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove OregonMost importantly the area had stretches of parallel tracks which allowed scenes of Buster on his trainagilely scrambling over the cars balancing on the roof to scan the horizon chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind himto be filmed from another train running alongside Buster his train and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Busters hair while smoky pinecovered hills rise and fall around him These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures and they put to shame all later backprojection and process shots models and computergenerated effects The quality of Keatons filmmaking is simplypun intendedunparalleled Every shot in The General is clean fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times The film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional just like the grave masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniformsThe Generals narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look Like a train it stays on track never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline Adapting the historical incident Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train Johnnie Gray rather than one of the raiders As he saw immediately The General is one long chase or rather two chases structured like the flight of a boomerang First Johnnie on a borrowed train the Texas chases his own stolen train the General He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines pursued by the raiders in the Texas who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high commandThe General is not Keatons funniest film but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs A number of the gags like the boxcar that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks have a long buildup for a relatively modest payoff But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings The cannon attached to the back of Busters train goes off just as the train starts around a curve so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders train coming out of the curve Riding on the cowcatcher Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his trains wheels so lost in thought he doesnt notice when the train starts to move carrying him up and down in gentle arcs stillness in motionI agree with author Jim Kline who describes The General as Keatons most personal film the one that best captures his unique vision spirit and personality In many of his films Buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero But his competent ingenious and athletic character in The General who is also modest tireless and underestimated comes much closer to his real nature There is a shot in The General of Busters eye isolated on screen framed by a hole in a white tablecloth that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertovs kinoglaz the cameraeye Keaton melds with his camera; theres no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies They have the same silence the same strictness the same strange blend of gravity and humorThe General might be the most serious comedy every made but its not a tragicomedy That as in Chaplins blending of pathos and low humor was something people took to immediately But no one knew what to make of The General Original reviews accused the film of being dull pretentious unoriginal and unfunny Even today people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing The General is challenging because it doesnt flaunt its virtues; like Keatons concise and economical performance it holds a great deal in reserve Take the movies most famous shot of a train crashing through a burning bridge for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film he doesnt dwell on it or hype it Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience never manipulates never overplays He doesnt show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents nor does he play for sympathy Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold But for those who can see the expressiveness of Busters socalled stone face who get his peculiar dry humor who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated Buster Keaton always has more than hes showing; you can see it in his eyes,10
227,tt0017925,It is generally or should I pun and say General Lee? said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keatons career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past but getting the correct rolling stock costumes weapons and props to make it look correct And it worked so well that Keaton never really could despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR outdo it In fact the closest thing to his best sound film or film that he influenced that was a sound film was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE where he returned to a Civil War themeTHE GENERAL as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE is based on the Andrews Raiders stealing of the Confederate locomotive The General and an attached train which was used to damage tracks and bridges The raid in February  was from northern Georgia into Tennesee It only lasted  miles as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial Others went to southern prisoner of war camps The effect of the incident far outstripped its military success The damage after all could be repaired But like Jimmy Doolittles Raid over Tokyo in April  it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky/Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhileDespite it being a brief incident of the war the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south When Lesney did it famous series of Models of Yesteryear the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was The GeneralThe story however was ultimately a downer But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period First he changes the viewers perspective  it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men but on the Confederates Secondly he builds up the story of Johnny Gray a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier Because Keatons family and girl friend Marion Mack see he is not enlisted they believe he turned cowardJohnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake the General from the raiders and the film has actually two chases in it  first Andrews and his men stealing the train and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking itAlong the way are many comic classic moments such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train or when at a moment of dejection Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase and finding Marion Mack there helping him are wonderful  especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired she throws away the ugly little ones Keatons reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful momentThe classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river and the burning of the railroad bridge with its destruction of a second locomotive It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history By the way the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest He was Mike Turkey Strut Donlin a frequent member and starring player of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the th Century Donlin who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases left baseball to become a film actor he had worked a bit in vaudeville Keaton was a sports fan and showed this in his film COLLEGE where he shows his abilities in several sports and hired Donlin This was the latters most famous performance  look at his reaction to the collapseIt must be regarded as Keatons finest film and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures,10
228,tt0017925,No one will top Keaton for physical risk and risk is what deep film experiences are all about This might be classed as a comedy but for me it touches deeply enough Its about a man who needs to prove himself by taking risks and being true And its by a man who takes even greater risks and is more true True to the spirit of the social compact here displayed as the chummy southHes always done stunts that amaze Many of his other films have things in them that if the timing were only a little off hed be seriously injured or die But this takes the cake Its almost as if he started with the idea that hed have three locos to play with and had a year to think up stunts And the stunts are so physical! And so dangerous And so so very effective His trademark is the deadpan face placed as a sort of innocent cluelessness Its particularly funny when you see the physical movements and you know that  they take incredible preparation and timing to pull off and  the fellow you see that looks so puzzled by the reality you see is the guy that devised and directed those stuntsTeds Evaluation   of  Worth watching,0
229,tt0017925,I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number # on the  version of AFIs Top  Movies of all time list It didnt make the cut at all for the original compilation in  so even before seeing the picture I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion I usually line up with the majority in most cases but I have to admit I dont quite get it with this picture I found it entertaining enough on occasion but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way its heralded on the DVD sleeve I dont think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy so right there my expectations were greatly reduced Keatons somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition dont help On the flip side I wouldnt have expected slapstick to move the story along either so at least I wasnt disappointed in that regardWhat I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity When Johnnie Gray Keaton dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army and pondered his situation while sitting on the trains connecting rod the resulting visual was pure genius The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnies thoughtful reverie and was one of the highlights of the picture for meThe other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge For starters I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb  unbelievableOh yes and I cant forget the sequence where Keatons marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a preCGI world its difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own For that Keaton deserves accoladesIn between all this clever film making however I just wasnt inspired The central plot element doesnt hold up for me  if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer why wasnt he simply told the reason why One could argue that then you wouldnt have a picture but for me it left the story on a shaky footing If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier the picture might have taken a different approach but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero Maybe Im second guessing a master but thats what I come away withConclusion  if this movie didnt make AFIs Top  Film List in  I dont understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top  At the same time Chaplins City Lights in my estimation a superior silent film fell OFF the list while The Gold Rush moved up a few notches I may not be a professional but I know what I like and this one just didnt do it for me,7
230,tt0017925,Buster Keatons The General about a man and his engine puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen From major comic situations to throwaway gags The General always knows what to doThe story begins in leisurely fashion A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray Keaton has two loves in his life his engine and his girlrespectively The General and Annabelle Lee Marion Mack Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle followed by two engineerworshipping boys and unknown to him Annabelle Lee herself He and his entourage arrive at the door; Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs slicks back his hair and gently taps the door with the door knocker Then he turns to notice Annabelle Keatons understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness Any other comedian would have done an explosive doubletakeNow Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor but the boys are there too Johnnie stands up puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave The heroworshippers are ready to follow but Johnnie lets them out first then closes the door on them This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pantsNow the two are alone Annabelles father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon the War Between the States has begun Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist then turns expectantly to Johnnie who cocks his head like a confused puppy She asks Arent you going to enlist? Realization hits him and he leaps off the seat Before he can run out the door Annabelle kisses him This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porchJohnnie races to the general store which is now a makeshift recruitment office Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation but the man rejects him Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer Later Annabelle believes that Johnnie didnt even try to enlist She refuses to speak to him again until hes in uniform What follows is a classic moment Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine Hes so miserable that he doesnt notice when he starts moving up and down until just before the train enters a tunnelTime passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General When nearly everyone is off the train having dinner the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine Annabelle a passenger herself was still on board She is now their prisonerBut Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen possibly by deserters He pursues the engine by taking another The Texas Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas but the Unionists think theyre outnumbered and continue to run What follows is the true joy of the movie two long chases separated by an important plot twist Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop actionI love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas At one point the car which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track reappears in front of the baffled engineer only to disappear later just as mysteriously We see the logical circumstances that lead to the cars seeming magic act and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied preventing him from seeing what we seeComic logic is important to The General In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable In a throwaway gag Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for itWe move to the second chase where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle LeeMarion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was She has hilarious moments The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire She takes a small stick and daintily puts it in Johnnie sarcastically hands her a sliver and she puts that in too Then in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping Johnnie grabs her and halfthrottles her before kissing her insteadThe final section most of it a battle scene includes the shot where The Texas begins to cross a burning bridge only to crash into the river Owing to Keatons disdain of fakery one of several reasons his works seem modern he did not use a model but a real train on a real burning bridge The crash cost $reportedly making it the single most expensive shot ever in a silent filmA worthy closing gag was too taxing even for Keatons ingenuity Johnnies dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers His remedy is only mildly funny Is anyone complaining? The General is a work of art and a work of genius,0
231,tt0017925,This film flopped when it was released in late  for several reasons First its premiere was delayed because Flesh and the Devil was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks Second people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian not Buster the filmmaker and director which is more of the role he played here The film was funny but it was not gag after gag like so many of Keatons other films Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South A title card declares he has two loves  his girl and his engine when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession His girlfriend misunderstands thinks him a coward and says she wont speak to him again until he is in uniformMeanwhile the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Busters train Unknown to Buster his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train still without the knowledge of his girls captivity by the Union armyForgotten with the arrival of sound the film revived  often cut up from its original length  in the s because Buster didnt preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today often with poor video and hideous musical accompanimentToday The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too SHERLOCK JR is clever OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious The General is both of these things Its story driven races to a climax and is fueled by cute clever inventive gagsBuster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in A Southern Yankee,9
232,tt0017925,One of the great masterpieces of cinema Buster Keatons The General combines inventive humor with terrific action and fine melodrama all beautifully and carefully planned and photographed  It is filled with subtle and wonderful details that make it well worth devoting your full attention to watching  As an extra bonus it offers a fascinating look at the Civil War era with many realistic details inspired by a historical incidentAfter a short opening sequence the movie divides nicely into two halves Johnny Keaton is a railway engineer turned down in his attempts to enlist in the Confederate Army and subsequently rejected by his girl  Continuing with the railroad one day his locomotive is stolen by Union spies who also kidnap his girl  Johnny first chases the engine into Union territory to recapture it and then is himself chased by the Northern Army as he attempts to return home  Both chases are filled with excitement and manic fun with some breathtaking stunts by Keaton thrown in  It all leads up to a dramatic and memorable climax that includes many ironic and suggestive touchesKeaton is at his best with the story offering him a perfect showcase for his many talents  His slapstick and acrobatic skills are given free rein and his characters stoic perseverance is a fine complement to the frantic actionThis belongs near the top of any list of great films a classic worth watching and rewatching,0
233,tt0017925,I havent had so much fun watching a movie for a long time The General is a silent comedy mostly slapstick about Johnny Gray a train engineer with two loves his engine and Annabelle Lee Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer Things are then sped up a year where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan As it so happens they steal Johnnys engine a big mistakeBuster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies but of course less old He is often ignorant of what is going on around him leading to plenty of laughs This also makes him a very charismatic characterThere are countless train related jokes The first one comes right at the beginning when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman in a line much like a train The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment The finale is explosiveThe General was a lot of fun to watch It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies and had plenty of substance on top of that This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever After my first viewing it instantly became one of my favorites It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies,10
234,tt0017925,THE GENERAL represents the greatest achievement screen comedy ever accomplished From the brilliant gag construction to the sheer excellence of the filmmaking technique THE GENERAL is a hilarious and amazing journey into comedy Written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman Keaton brings brilliant gags into the story The film begins when Keaton is told he is of no use to the South as a soldier but as a train engineer However his girlfriend refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform After the war has started the girl is kidnapped by some Union raiders on Keatons train and so begins the greatest and funniest chase ever filmed For the next  minutes the viewer is in Keatons world His gags routines and amazing slapstick serve to make this the greatest screen comedy ever filmedMatt age ,0
235,tt0017925,Ive seen one other silent movie in my life but it was Mel Brookss The Silent Movie so I dont know if it really counts I really enjoyed The General overall more than I thought I would as someone who was born after The GodfatherThe main thing that surprised me was the fact that I couldnt look down to write very many notes; any time I took my eyes off the screen I ran a serious risk of missing something It seems to me that the film even though it was long or seemed so it was very dense in terms of action I imagine that since the movie has no dialogue the filmmakers must make up for it by making it as visually interesting and entertaining as possible I am accustomed to more modern movies with snappy dialogue and special effects and suchmovies in which you can look down at your popcorn or kiss your date and not miss too much because you can hear pretty much whats happening This was a nice change for meObviously Ive never seen a Buster Keaton film and Im not even sure if Id heard of him before this class But I can see why he is so appealing in his films I loved his facial expressions particularly the stoicbutcrestfallen look in his eyes on the train when something else goes wrong He also has great control of his body as we discussed in class and a fine sense of comic timingI found the film surprisingly funny Many modern films that I think are funny eg Austin Powers Toy Story American Beauty rely largely on witty or outrageous dialogue for their humor As a silent film The General must rely mainly on images for its humorthe slapstick images of Johnnie falling over constantly the unusual image of Johnnie riding up and down on the crossbar between the train wheels the stereotype exploitation in the scene when the girl sweeps out the locomotive Im sure that some of the things that I considered amusing might not have been considered funny by the original audience such as the recordscratch lightning bolts,0
236,tt0017925, Georgia USA The American Civil War is in its second year and Johnnie Gray is barred from enlisting He is a train engineer and the Confederate Army feel he is more valuable to the Southern cause in his current role than in the army This frustrates Johnnie and has estranged him from his sweetheart Annabelle who views him as a coward Then his beloved engine The General is stolen by Union spies and is heading for Union lines Moreover Annabelle is on board Johnnie sets off after the two loves of his lifeGreat comedy from the silent era directed and starring one of the greatest comedy directors and actors of that era Buster Keaton This is a rollicking adventure complete with wonderfully thoughtout and performed physical comedy and other sight gags Some very clever use of the plot to generate the comedyThe plot itself isnt overly profound but crams in a lot of action and adventure plus some romanceVery entertaining,8
237,tt0017925,THE GENERAL When one watches for the first time the General great things happen laughter relief a neverending smileand that old sniff of old good cinema I must admit not many films out there give the pleasure this one has It is like everything just falls right into place Overall the movie is a perfect account of all the things that make comedy great Simplicity good and twisted plot a sense of the unexpected becoming more and more realDo you feel me dont you? It has been attributed to Chalie Chaplin the following sentence to make a comedy film you only need three things a park a woman and a police officer We can safely say The General stands up to it Well there is no park in The General although the landscape is used wisely but theres a woman As for the police officerwell not exactly What we do have in the film are soldiers Im afraid of telling you the plot of the story because I dont want to spoil anything I reckon itd be better if you find it out for yourselves Well lets just say that Buster Keaton plays the main character an engineer whose beloved locomotive has been stolen by Union spies From that point on he does everything in his power to get it back Theres nothing more for me to say butEnjoy yourselves!!,8
238,tt0017925,To watch The General is to be both awed and amused at what takes place The consensus view is correct This is an amazing movieYou know whats more amazing? Despite what most critics say Buster Keaton made funnier better films than thisKeaton a lifelong railroad buff is engineer Johnny Gray captain of The General a locomotive which carries passengers and freight across the American South When the Civil War breaks out he tries to enlist and thus please his girl Annabelle Lee Marion Mack but the authorities deem him more useful running trains When Union spies seize the General with an idea of using it to burn bridges and disrupt the Confederate supply line its up to Gray to save the dayNew York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall reviewed The General back in  and expressed disappointment This is by no means so good as Mr Keatons previous efforts he wrote People cite Halls review as a classic example of whatdocriticsknow but the more I read the more I agreed with him The fun is not exactly plentiful he wrote noting Keaton here was too much the acrobat too little the clownWhen I watched The General I felt disappointment too Like Halls it wasnt total; its exciting and inventive and boasts some of the finest screen compositions Ive ever seen The technical expertise on display is astounding Its just that the overall experience left me a bit flatFirst you have what Roger Ebert liked to call the idiot plot Gray tries to enlist and is rejected by the army because hes too valuable as a train engineer Annabelle apparently never learns this for she rejects him as a coward I dont want you to speak to me again until youre in uniform she huffsEither hes an idiot for not explaining the truth of the matter or shes an idiot for preferring her lover be cannon fodder than a real asset to their cause Anyway Buster does manage to make this play later on When he finally speaks to her he is in uniform an enemy uniformThe other main issue involves what Lincoln called the slows A lot of the story is literally trainwatching Buster does some brave amazing stuntwork and throws in some clever gags later joined by Mack whos no Sibil Seely but still quite game but its basically a lot of watching trains go by The craft here is in the precision of the camerawork and the splitsecond timing not so much the comedy In fact except for Buster himself everyone plays it completely straight probably because this is real history being presented Compared to other Keaton comedies it feels a bit straitjacketed by thatThe General is still a solid thrill comedy with some amusing one liners If you lose this war dont blame me Johnny yells after being rejected and brilliant sight gags like the fussy Annabelles rejection of unattractive firewood while Buster struggles to stoke the engineTo me thats enough for The General to be another good reason for loving Buster Keaton I just cant understand it being the preeminent reason Maybe critics cant really love a comedy for just making you laugh and laugh Im just glad Keaton made other movies at least as brilliant as The General and funnier too,7
239,tt0017925,Buster Keaton s performance in The General was purely enjoyable The story takes place during the civil war on centers on Johnnie Gray Keaton a train operator in the South Johnnie is not accepted for service in the confederate army because of his value on the railroad and suffers the shame of being home while the other men are fighting a war When his beloved engine is hijacked by Union soldiers the unpredictable story goes into overdrive Johnnies adventure includes train chases rescuing the love of his life a daring escape and a climactic battle This film has a distinct action/adventure aspect but at its core it is a brilliant comedy/drama Keatons performance is superb He has the ability to effortlessly change your mood and the mood of the film with his facial expressions and physical comedy Keatons character seems to make endless mistakes that work for the best and good decisions in dangerous situations It is easy to imagine Keaton as a major influence for a future comedians and I personally felt like I was watching the Mel Brooks of a previous generation The General was a fun film to watch with a true star Buster Keaton turning in a timeless heartfelt performance,7
240,tt0017925,When watching The General  the similarities between Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin are almost unmistakable The story was original and humorous and the performance by Buster Keaton was pleasing What I didnt like was the fact that the protagonist still was pursuing the girl who was so quick to leave him when she thought he wasnt brave and then ends up staying with her at the end He is too good for her I thought the stunt where the bridge gives out and the train falls was very well done and must have cost a fortune There were scenes where I found myself laughing out loud and scenes where I was bored So unfortunately the film doesnt do a great job at keeping the viewer glued to the screen but overall it was enjoyable,7
241,tt0017925,I feel the The General is a great silent film because even though the story line is relatively complicated the way in which each character played their part and the way it was filmed made it easy to follow I am fairly new to the silent film experience and when I saw that this movie was partially a comedy I was expecting something more along the lines of Charlie Chaplin however I was pleasantly surprised at Buster Keatons more subtle comedic style I felt that the film was well shot shot considering the technology of the day I was actually shocked during the scene where the Rock River Bridge collapsed under The Texas Knowing full well it was not special effects I couldnt believe the producers would spare the expense of destroying a locomotive and an entire bridge This movie is sure to be one of my favorite silent films,7
242,tt0017925,Buster Keaton always amazes me He was truly one of the most hilarious deadpan screen clowns of early cinema And The General even clocking in at around three hours is surprisingly watchable based on his physical performance aloneGranted I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything thats unnecessary but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments There are multiple points in the General a story about a Southern engineer that has to rescue his beloved from the clutches of the North in the Civil War where Keatons character Johnnie Gray has to stop his train jump out and remove something from the tracks which in itself can be quite boring but the way that Keaton injects physical comedy into those moments keeps me entertainedAnd its a marvel how so many realistic yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with Its nothing fantastic like some of his other films but its still funny And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversitybut he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and its just enough to know that he is frightened but that the rest of him doesnt react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny Whether hes pratfalling due to surprise or erroneously succeeding at something hes unskilled in and being shocked by it that response of his is winningBut the General does show its age a little It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesnt get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context I wouldnt dare cut those moments out of this film even if I could reedit it because the space always had something going on but at the same time this film if made today would be cut to oneandahalf or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly The plot and story are simple but exist more than to just help the comedy move alongexcept at the end when the first story was accomplished Then we move into a second extraneous but still amusing story regarding a battle between the North and the South that couldve been excised and still having a decent though simple storyI didnt really love the score that the DVD company attached to it which is a number of classical pieces end on end I think a new commissioned soundtrack wouldve better matched the piece but I guess we get what we get And on the plus side you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of itIs it perfect? No But despite the age it shows it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinemas greatest physical comedians If you want to spend three hours with a silent clown this is not a bad way to go /,8
243,tt0017925,Have a lot of appreciation for comedy especially the witty and sophisticated kinds and there are a good deal of classic comedies that go for the broad approach too Am significantly less keen though on the vulgar puerile style of humour that is seen quite a lot today the worst of it veering on the offensive There are many instances of silent films/comedies seen with Charlie Chaplin prime Laurel and Hardy and with Buster KeatonKeaton is seen as one of the greats by many but for some reason doesnt seem to be quite as well known even with a just as good reputation critically as Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy who transitioned better into sound maybe when at his best in the s an extraordinary period with a deservedly lauded reputation he was every bit as great as funny and as likeable His daring physical comedy and stoic deadpan expressions were unique and ahead of its time at the time and still amaze and are distinct now plus he was a bigger risktaker with bolder material and immense courage that most wish they could have Which perhaps hasnt been more apparent than in this film The General often considered one of his best and most important films or even his masterpiece though with other just as worthy efforts it has been debated and justifiably so This paragraph is very subjective of course and probably wont be agreed with but that is just my respectful stanceThe General to this day still looks great and remarkably lavish something of a technical achievement in its day It also should be used as an example of how to have effects that still look good and like a lot of effort and care went into them and also use them properly rather than overusing and abusing them to gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now The locomotive features heavily here and to ingenious and quite imaginative effect The direction keeps the momentum going with ease and balances all The Generals elements every bit as adeptlyWhen it comes to the humour which is very physical it is never less than very funny and is timed inventively throughout no corniness at all and it gels very well But The General is much more than just a comedy and one can say that its not really one It has other elements too and executes them even better actually especially the action the scope dexterity and boldness of it and especially those stunts absolutely jawdropping and truly exciting to watch It is also an example of how to have action that thrills while being easy on the eyes coherent and not being too noisy or busy something to learn fromAlso here is a tender understated quality that is very surprising and the romantic element is genuinely charming without being sappy The film also has a story thats easy to follow and at the same time is logical and interesting indicating a film with brains as well as soul that treats the viewer with respect rather than getting irritated by credibility straining and logic lapses Keaton is superb here not only is his comic timing on point but he provides a character thats endearing and worth rooting for His physicality and how he copes with the stunts is aweinspiring and he is one of not many to make deadpan interesting and entertaining because he still makes it very expressive and nuanced The rest of the cast are easy to overlook but are just as strong even if with not as much to do or with material that sticks in the mind as muchOverall brilliant and a Buster Keaton essential / Bethany Cox,10
244,tt0017925,There are some truly wonderful scenes in this film which is full of adventure comedy and some pretty impressive stuntwork on moving trains by Buster Keaton and the other actors The premise is that Keaton a train conductor has volunteered to fight for the South at the outset of the Civil War but been turned down When his train is stolen by Union soldiers he immediately gives chase on foot then a handcar briefly a bicycle and then finally another train not knowing quite yet that his girlfriend Marion Mack was inadvertently also kidnappedIn one of the memorable early scenes Keaton is sitting on the connecting rod of the locomotive lost in thought when it starts up bobbing him up and down In another he packs a cannon on his train with a massive charge and as its angle slowly descends before firing it appears hes going to blow himself up until his train at the last minute hits a curve and he nearly hits his intended target Its just wonderful There is also of course the scene with a Union train going out onto a burning bridge which then collapses one of the most iconic and expensive scenes of the eraIn addition to those big moments there are also innumerable little things Keaton does which highlight his genius He is just so lovable and talented He uses one of the large railroad ties intended to derail him to knock another off the track as his train is moving When hes hiding under a table surrounded by Union officers hes subtly kicked and jostled in funny ways As he makes his escape with Mack he stuffs her into a large sack that he had emptied of shoes only to lose his own shoe in the process and struggle to locate it I also thought I saw bits of Woody Allen in the scene where he urges her to be quiet only to knock things over and make noise himselfAmbitious aweinspiring influential clever and still funny + years later Is it the best ever? I dont know I liked The Cameraman  even more but still – damn good,9
245,tt0017925,Buster Keaton is Johnnie Gray a southerner who wants to fight for the cause but gets rejected because he could be of more use as an engineer than as a soldier Unfortunately hes not told why he was turned down and his gal just assumes that hes a coward Not so because when a Yankee scallywag steals his beloved steam engine the titular The General Johnnie heads north to recover the engine and through a series of misadventures becomes a hero of the Confederacy and rescues Annabelle Lee Glorious sight gags abound as Old Stone Face deals with errant cannon loose sword blades uncooperative firewood inexplicable soakings and a lessthanhelpful rescuee not to mention an entire army of bluebellies Great fun from another era and a wonderful example of the silent genre,8
246,tt0017925,Buster Keaton plays the lead in this silent era masterpiece that takes its inspiration from the Great Locomotive Chase which in turn was a real event during the American Civil War in which a train was stolen by the North and sped over the lines in preparation for the coming offenseThe General has some definitive upsides working in its favour Buster Keaton is an amazingly versatile performer able to go from clownish jokester to a saddened victim of war and poor circumstances in a heartbeat The film is also really ambitious in scope Keaton performs all of his stunts most of them hairraisingly dangerous and completely unimaginable nowadays Plus very little money is spared and the film famously has some of the most expensive set pieces and stunts of the silent eraThe plot of the film is also a lot more cohesive than say in the films made by Charlie Chaplin in the same decade Chaplins films usually contain segments that have little to do with anything except the need for funny situations The General is also a comedy but with a clear clean story arcOn the other hand I didnt find the humour or the characters as captivating Theyre okay but in this regard the decades of cultural development between the film and yours truly work against the film I just didnt find the slapstick all that funnyStill The General is a great watch for all interested in early cinema or really involved physical humour,0
247,tt0017925,The General is one of the great films and treasures of the silent era Its among the best movies of the talented comedy actor Buster Keaton In this film Keaton shows the athletic ability and courage that made him one of the best of the early comedians who performed their own stunts His physical antics on and off his train The General support his title as king of comedy stunts All the silent era comedy actors seemed to have lots of energy And many had daring courage and even madness at times Those were the actors who did all or most of their own stunts While there were some stunt men around in the early s it wasnt until the last of the silent years and dawn of sound pictures that stuntmen were a regular part of the cast of films that required any amount of derringdo And while a small number of actors today will still do some of their own stunts nothing can compare to the actors of old who performed their own highrisk and dangerous stunts – and sometimes those for other actors The five best early actors at doing stunts were Buster Keaton Douglas Fairbanks Sr Harold Lloyd Tom Mix and Yakima Canutt The latter two specialized in Westerns and besides acting and doing stunt work Mix and Canutt regularly rode and performed in the rodeo circuit Lloyd was versatile in his venues but excelled at high stunts on buildings and sometimes with wild animals Fairbanks excelled in swashbuckler stunts sliding down the sails of ships swinging from anything hanging aloft and jumping with the help of trampolines into windows Keaton was even more versatile As a child actor in vaudeville Keaton learned how to fall to avoid injury He called his technique soft falls or landings But even with his training and practice his film roles with derringdo often left him bruised at the least At other times he had suffered injuries from slight to serious Still he had become known for his physical resiliency During the filming of The General in  Keaton was knocked unconscious by canon fire He suffered a broken ankle while filming the  short The Electric House And he broke his neck during the  shooting of Sherlock Jr but didnt know it until years later This movie has an interesting plot set during the US Civil War It opens with a scene and script that reads The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marietta Georgia in the spring of  The train seems to be traveling about  miles per hour But the film is almost entirely about action and the comedy in the action involving the train There is an element of romance The cast all are very good The photography is superb Much of the action with trains is filmed in Westcentral Oregon from Eugene to Cottage Grove Theres no information about sound at all so I assume the music we hear with the film is soundtrack that was added for modern viewing It probably is meant to replicate the piano accompaniment that was usual with silent films in theaters of the day This is one instance when I think the piano playing would have been better The music seems to go overboard at times This is one of the early great films from the silent era that showcase the talent and early mastery of moviemaking skills Its a fun movie with strong visuals that even a modern family of all ages should enjoy,10
248,tt0017925,Johnnie Gray a train engineer tries to enlist in the Confederate Army to impress his girlfriend Unfortunately he is rejected because his role as engineer is deemed more important Lucky for Gray he is given the opportunity to prove himself when a band of Union soldiers in disguise hijack a trainAt the time of this films release it was a flop and considered to be not very funny Since then it has gone on to be declared one of the greatest films of all time Funny how that works I would tend to agree that it isnt really very funny but it is a great film for a variety of reasonsBuster Keaton was an amazing actor and director He was willing to put himself in dangerous situations for a laugh  he was his own stuntman right there when the train falls in the water really sitting on the side of a moving train and on the front of it he could have been killed And this was captured on film flawlesslyPersonally I enjoyed his Sherlock Jr better I thought the tricks were better and the action funnier It had a faster pace too that kept me hooked enough to watch it a few times The General was not boring but as a silent film it could have done more to grab the audience and Im not sure that it did,7
249,tt0012349,While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplins later features The Kid is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicelyWhile its a fairly simple story this is one of Chaplins most efficiently designed movies  Every scene either is necessary to the plot or is very funny for its own sake or both  Except for Chaplin and Coogan most of the other characters even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance are just there to advance the plot when needed and the two leads are allowed to carry the show which they both do extremely wellThe Kid is also impressive in that while the story is a sentimental one it strikes an ideal balance maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies  Here the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorableThis is one of Chaplins very best movies by any measure  If you enjoy silent comedies dont miss it,0
250,tt0012349,Ive always thought theres a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies even unsentimental ones like Keatons The General or Laurel and Hardys Way Out West The latter comedy has a scene where L&amp;H perform a softshoe dance; it always brings me to tears Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that Im laughing doesnt dilute the emotional chargeOne of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already Why not marry the two things? Thats what he did in some of his early short films and thats what he does in this feature comedy The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie Jackie Coogan away Meanwhile the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesnt know if shell ever find out what became of himJackie Coogan about five in this film with his charming manners his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy is one of the alltime great child actors Want more evidence of Chaplins genius? Coogan doesnt steal the film from him This is true even though Chaplin as producer star and director makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boys talents Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles like My Boy and Oliver TwistChaplins storytelling—even with the foolish subDickensian plot twists such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed The windowbreaking scene the flophouse scene the dream sequence the tryingtogetridofthebaby scene—theyre perfect Chaplins celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselvesWant me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know I cant even complain about that Its too sweetly naïve And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the very few flawsOne important note children love this movie Show it to them while theyre young and youll make Chaplin fans of them And thats better than their becoming fans of almost anything thats being peddled to them,0
251,tt0012349,Wow is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so That fact that it still entertains over  years after it was made is quite a testimony It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama Charlie Chaplins unique humor combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember Chaplins humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stuntsThe kid  Jackie Coogan  is just as memorable maybe even more so He is unbelievably cute especially in those oldtime clothes he wore Watching the expressions on his face even as a baby are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent eraSo between Chaplin and Coogan and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next its an amazing piece of work This is a very fastpaced story which lasts less than an hourThe special edition twodisc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear actually astounding for its age Excellent entertainment,9
252,tt0012349,THE KID First National Pictures  a comedydrama written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  plays an important part his screen career Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIES PUNCTURED ROMANCE  a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies but releases coming once every two to three years A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in  eventually under the supervision and direction of himself Chaplins methods in movie making improved with each passing film Like himself Jackie Coogan Chaplins littlest costar and title character made such an impression with his initial performance nearly upstaging his impresario that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own becoming Hollywoods first important child starTHE KID starts off with intertitles A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear followed by The woman whose sin was motherhood titles much to the liking of a DW Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish yet in fact might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplins whose very name personifies comedy A young girl Edna Purviance leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father Carl Miller a young artist never returns to her life The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away Crooks enter the scene stealing the car discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else but after stumbling upon a note which reads Please love and care for this orphan child he decides to raise the child himself Five years pass The kid whose name is believed to be John now Charlies adopted son and sidekick start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money As for the kids mother shes become a star of great prominence devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts where lives the kid The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions unaware of each others identities When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention a middleaged country doctor having discovered Charlie not the boys true father sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child awayTHE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product especially for a silent movie made so long ago Chaplin who constructs his gags to perfection has one difficult scene that comes off naturally this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as hes lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot a substitute for a baby bottle back into his mouth Another classic moment on a serious nature is when Charlie is being held back by authorities being forced to watch his crying son taken away from him Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as hes being chased by a policeman from the slanted rooftops The closeup where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on filmChaplin and little Jackie billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin right down to his baggy pants Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances is so convincing that it doesnt take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp From this point onward he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor at the same time adding more plot pathos and truly great comedy routinesAs much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that followsTHE KID which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years was resurrected in the s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in  It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in  as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection double billed along with a comedy short THE IDLE CLASS  In the DVD format the two disc set includes rare outtakes and deleted scenes Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library where it made its debut December   during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights hosted by Robert Osborne and later in March  when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its Star of the MonthFor its age THE KID holds up extremely well thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan Theres no doubt Jackie Coogan  became an overnight star with this one film He was a natural While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again on screen anyway without them there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID ****,10
253,tt0012349,The Kid is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplins oeuvre Chaplin hadnt filled a film so fully with pathos since The Vagabond  and then it was in a very limited way subject to the confines of tworeel length Additionally Sunnyside  was a failure The feature length of The Kid also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags pranks and set pieces and with the support of Jackie Coogan its one of his funniest comediesThe parentchild relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment and for me not many have neared Chaplin in exploiting that formula in The Kid The sequence where they take the kid for a workhouse away from the tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the filmor of all film In addition to Chaplin and Coogan Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture Furthermore Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totherohs photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist but the musical score added to the  release composed by Chaplin taken from Tchaikovsky gives the sentimental parts its most verveOf the slapstick one of my favorite scenes involves the tramp in fear of a bully Its reminiscent of his Mutual short Easy Street  which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film Yet The Kid is much more than that which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplins previous work This was the beginning of the tramp as the sympathetic pitiful hero as well as clown thats so recognizable and beloved to this dayMoreover the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect Its also funny in a silly way Its somewhat analogous to the outer reality story although with much ambiguity I wasnt always sure Chaplin was making any clear point such as with the Christ image earlier in the film but that seems unimportant; The Kid affects the emotions and isnt especially aimed at engaging the mind At six reels with more sets and a developed plot this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplins previous films; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth thus making The Kid Chaplins first complete feature,9
254,tt0012349,It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as The Kid It is a silent movie but so rich winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words Chaplin and year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness And I really never cry in movies And the musicits simply Oscarlevel! The movie is sympathetic full of feeling touchingly funny moments It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over  years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age don´t miss it,10
255,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous His character the Tramp is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early th century but something all of us can overcomeIn one of his first roles with this character he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family Taking himself and this very talented young boy Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote directed starred in and composed the score for this filmHere Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own He hasnt got much but he does have love which is more than can be said for the childs motherFlash forward five years and now the mother wants her son back Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion Even so the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks things not used much at the time in the movies Using these little tricks and ideas Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the storyHowever at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh sometimes in the same scene This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it,8
256,tt0012349,Is there a way to name the greatest filmmaker of all time? Probably not to different people its gonna be different person so I can speak only for myself Let me try to describe my favorite contestant for this award,0
257,tt0012349,Its easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius but Ill say it once again the man was a genius if only at doing a certain particular kind of film You wouldnt ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film or at least one like out of Germany or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the s and s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and the usual kickedaround word manipulated amid the comedic setups Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the KidAs it stands even at  minutes which was trimmed by Chaplin himself  years after its original release and including a new musical score its just about a perfectly told tale It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that Dreamland sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful lightanddark examination of all the major characters in the picture now with angel wings and devil horns! What its about in complete basics is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she wont be able to take care of him and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at and the Tramp decides to take care of him he even names him in one amusing aside John Then it cuts to  years later and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows eat lots of pancake and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an Older Brother of a kid John gets in a fight with Meanwhile the mother is now a success not knowing her child is somewhere right in front of her noseThis may sound like a bit of story but its told briskly and without a missed beat in editing and Chaplins reedit tightens it to a point where were mostly with the Kid and the Tramp Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be playful absurd cute and bittersweet to a degree We know this cant exactly last but the moment the poor maybesick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic and yet partially triumphant sequences in the movies Its in a case like this where we as the audience tear up more or less as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out and then intercut with Chaplins daring dash across the rooftops to save him that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film silent or otherwise; that its silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true even a beat with the Kid playing with toys an obviously cute bit is great and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like ChaplinFeaturing some excellent setpieces just unto themselves aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that bellylaugh part with the repetitive brickhit to the head or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin and excellent performances from all supporting cast including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance its altogether an aweinspiring feat To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness,10
258,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid the cute little Jackie Coogan has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos and true to what you would expect of his best work does it superbly  The tramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding a little boy to the mix was the finishing touch  Look out too for little Lita Grey in the angel sequence who would become Chaplins nd wife four years after this film was made,0
259,tt0012349,What makes a feature film different to a short? It isnt just length After all some of Charlie Chaplins later shorts were as long as fortyfive minutes while The Kid is barely an hour No when Chaplin made his graduation to fulllength features he also strove to broaden the scope scale and above all the dignity of his work The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplins careerThe Kid begins with a bit of backstory as a few of Chaplins shorts do but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this Here we have the opening of a drama and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief Of course such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short but here that wouldnt be appropriate Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laughoutloud funny but they certainly dont belong in a straight dramatic setting And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room sceneAnd never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration but still very natural by the standards of the time And of course little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive his movements expressions and timings all spoton so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness and he appears more like a human cartoon character Coogan steals the picture with ease and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously asideThis too is an important difference with The Kid Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act famously severing his partnership with the funnyinhisownright Ben Turpin back in  Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own The few examples such as the routine with the policemans wife and the window ledge are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material However he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this outToday The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful featurelength spinoff If you look at something like the minute Christmas special of The Office it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode Chaplins full length features however were far more than just spinoffs and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work,9
260,tt0012349,The Kid became a critically hailed international hit A tramp Charles Chaplin brings up an abandoned baby Jackie Coogan and later loses him to his mother Edna Purviance; but there is a happy endingThe film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums The comedy is sparingly laid on but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest The production is comparatively smooth young Coogan is sensational and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced His inspiration it is suggested was the death of his own first son Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in ,10
261,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins first full length feature film and his biggest success up to that date is a remarkably heartwarming story  which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy It begins with a woman whos sin was motherhood who gives birth to a baby she cant support at a Charity Hospital which is kept padlocked from the inside She is forced to abandon it in an alley and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film as he is casually strolling by and then through a series of odd but entirely believable situations he is unable to get rid of it It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin who was in top form playing the little boy at  years old Charlies life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplins traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed dramatic story The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments sometimes simultaneously if you can believe that but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival and it is never once predictable all the way until the last frameThere is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy and in between rounds  Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well and giving him hints for the rest of the fight Meanwhile the other kids brother shows up a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankensteins monster than anything else What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street This is a slapstick setup that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time were it not for its direct relevance to the storyAt another point there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home as the  version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackies arms I think this is the only time in any film that Ive ever seen genuine lowbrow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident This combination not just here but throughout the film is The Kids biggest achievement There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about although my understanding is that volumes have been written about its symbolic meaning both within the movie and in reference to Chaplins personal life And speaking of which supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing I dont know which story to believe that it was because of Chaplins painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary I would bet its a little of both but the film is here and I guess ultimately thats all that matters In the five or six times that Ive seen The Kid I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramps real son either on screen or off Then again I am looking at it with st century eyes Some of Shirley Temples early films are also a little disturbing to me although for not quite the same reasons By this time Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films and after  short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond along with a few assorted others Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema,10

263,tt0012349,The simple lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch Id say that it is as much funny as sad and the music score couldnt be more accuratePerhaps the most delightful surprise was to In the dreamland scene So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated the scene made me question myself if at the moment I was watching Buñuel and not Chaplin It is not my Chaplins favorite but its for sure one of his bests Totally recommend to be watched Chaplin will never disappoint you thats for sure If you watch this one also with City Lights and Modern Times youll be ready to enjoy his talkies The Great Dictator a classic and the perfect touching till tears Limelight,9
264,tt0012349,Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five yearsIn reading Charlie Chaplins memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him The second thing was Chaplins determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be doneThe success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they dont totally steal the film from youThe Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid Hes the same rapscallion Tramp we all know but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp one of deep feeling and protectiveness Two people who need and love each other very much This film couldnt missFirst National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin the studio and his estranged wife Mildred Harris The Robert Downey Jr biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itselfTill that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid,9
265,tt0012349,The Kid was released in  at the pinnacle of the Silent era when emotions came to screen through looks and body language when we didnt need dialog we had faces And if theres one film where Charlie Chaplins face oddly illuminates the screen its definitely The Kid Sure many fans would argue that City Lights is Chaplins masterpiece but something is too perfect too masterfully directed it was made during the talking era Chaplin was in his s and had more experience while The Kid features a more youthful director It belongs to a whole other era and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed in  Chaplin was  Hitchcock  Brando wasnt even born discovering The Kid is like turning the pages of a dusty yellowpaged historical book one eye is watching the film while the other discovers a period And I dont know if Im the only one but theres something in the setting the location that makes the film look even older For all I saw the movie could have been set in the early century and considering the timing of the film maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin himself The film was made in a difficult personal time when hed just lost his son after his birth There was a great wound in Chaplins heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragementThe context of The Kid is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time which is even more impressive considering his sevenyear experience a short time but enough to create an icon the Little Tramp an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema Chaplins story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and Im sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame  and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a filmmakerThe Emigrant in  was like the first step back into Chaplins past inspired by his own experience The movie doesnt feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future and leaving the motherland wasnt synonym of sadness but the emotions were there beyond the slapstick and the comedy and waiting for another step back to finally explode in an emotional firework which directly transports us to Chaplins past He who grew up without a father and started working at an early age he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living before it cemented his talent he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin And this is how The Kid was made and for the first time Chaplin would become more than a simple clown and get all the respect he needed from his peers as a gifted filmmaker He could finally make his first masterpiece The Gold Rush but The Kid was this necessary last breath before taking the big diveMany aspects of The Kid highlight Chaplins past and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs  a woman abandons a child expecting him to be adopted by a rich family until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramps arms But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who despite the archetypal situations didnt make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt as is the father a nicelooking fellow and a sign that Chaplin doesnt hold any grief against his father These things happen and we shouldnt feel sorry as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos  the Tramp and the KidIn every aspect the Kid is Chaplins alter ego  hes smart tender funny sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing Weve seen so many child performances since  to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is and Jackie Coogan is one of the best if not the best almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy and that the kid didnt become as much a star as Chaplin is one of cinemas cruelest ironies The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense closeups on Chaplins face  his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen and whatever inhabits the Tramps heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himselfChaplin like Disney for animation handled drama with the same strength as for comedy the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy fun cheers and even some dreamy escapism allowing a selfreflexive approach of the magic of childhood The Kid is not perfect but its a masterpiece of sincerity of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music If not his best its his most defining film ,9
266,tt0012349,This is such a incredible movieAlong with City Lights and The Gold Rush this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin and it is also one of the best movies ever madeIt is true that for the modern viewers the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the boxofficeThat doesnt mean this movie isnt entertaining In fact I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny comedies and also way more emotional and engagingI truly loved this film It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldnt be forgotten,10
267,tt0012349,The opening title to this film reads A film with a smile  and perhaps a tear Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken for Charlie Chaplins The Kid has a plethora of smiles from start to finish and yes a few tears as well The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character played by Chaplin The Tramp takes the baby into his own care Five years go by and the Tramp and the Kid portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan are getting along just fine However a turn of events results in the two being separated and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his sonCharlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking and this film is one of his best His direction is truly remarkable being able to manipulate the audiences emotions so much without sound He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget He manages to make you laugh almost nonstop from start to finish and even wind up causing you to shed a tear Its so emotionally gripping and you just fall in love with these characters from the getgo Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinemaAs emotionally wrenching this film is its simply hilarious This film has some great slapstick humor and Chaplin is a true master of it Jackie Coogan is also great If I had to find one flaw with the film it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I dont really mind it despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film Overall The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute then tug at your heartstrings the next Its an absolute riot but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema Ive ever seen And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue its just incredible And not to mention the music is just stellar too Chaplin is a master at composition The Kid is one of my favorite films and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!,10
268,tt0012349,When watching this I wanted to give the film a  rather than an  simply because I do not think it is as good as Modern Times or one or two others However taking into account that this is  and the film technology is not all there I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done it could have been made a decade later and looked the sameChaplin has to of course be given a lot of credit for producing writing directing and starring Being a great comic actor is one thing but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid and they nailed it  hes adorable emotional and seems able to handle any situation,8
269,tt0012349,The worlds most famous tramp is back and this time he has kid sidekick! Sounds kind of gimmicky right? But it works perfectly! Chaplin and child actor Jackie Coogan work extremely well together Their scenes are filled with heart and you can see that they both enjoyed themselves during the making of the movie The movie has the signature Chaplin slapstick that is guaranteed to have you in stitches but it also has some genuinely sad and emotional moments making this movie one of Chaplins most fondly remembered from his gigantic and legendary filmography,10
270,tt0012349,A tramp finds an abandoned kid on the street He tries to get rid of it in Charlie Chaplin way but ends up raising it with road side values Child becomes an apple of his eyes in a few years but the mother comes back to claim her son I had heard that this was the best movie Charlie Chaplin made but I disagree with that statement completely No doubt its a fantastic movie with a very strong story and message but its definitely not his best I found the last scene of the movie a little contrite and compromising The story has been adapted and tried in very many forms Extremely sensitive and though provoking cinema A must see for all,8
271,tt0012349,I was hardly a Chaplin fan in fact I loved Laurel &amp; Hardy and really didnt like Charlie Chaplin until I found that I could impersonate him as a lookalike  Then while viewing his films for the need of impersonating I have become a big Charlie Chaplin fan  His comedy mingled with pasos and pantomime was unique and very funny; and this one is certainly one of his bestIn it a sixyear old Jackie Coogan makes his screen debut as a little orphan that the tramp picks up and cares for five years  Every moment of this film is terrific it moves along swiftly and made me shed a tear three or few times  Chaplins score is undeniably a great piece of artwork and the acting is superb; nobody in this film lacksespecially ChaplinI recommend this film for all to see  Its age has not diminished this little love tale for a family in fact it makes you realize family love even more  Youll laugh cry and have a great time out  Rent it  Buy it View it  Its a film for all to see,0
272,tt0012349,They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but Im not so sure anymore There has been a generational discontinuity at least in the USA that seems to have happened about  or  years ago I suspect that most people over the age of  could identify Charlie Chaplin and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinctionGenerally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation but Jackie Coogan is an exceptionSentimental manipulation there is but its mainly limited to one or two scenes The comedy is pretty acerbic Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again Thats not what passes for sentimentalityBesides Coogan is cute when hes  or  years old a ragamuffin dressed in floppy oversized bags of clothing so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it And the kid can act tooCharlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him which was all he had to do Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because hes too inexperienced to know how to overact Chaplain is good too of course How could one person be so inventive? Its said that TV eats up talent because of the constant demand for new material One of the better series Twilight Zone had about three good years of collaborative effort in it Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in  films and directed something like  of them and he was just getting startedIll give one example of a joke without an iota of sentiment in it to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid a big bully who knocks him about Chaplain spots this interrupts the fight and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing  go for the belly keep your guard up  and sends him back into the fight At this point the bullys hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says If your boy beats my boy Im going to beat you Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bullys chin and flattens him But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back Chaplain dashes over puts his foot on the Coogans chest to hold him down quickly counts to ten rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand  the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy Youll enjoy it Especially if youre one of those rare folks under  with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue,0
273,tt0012349,A picture with a smile and perhaps a tearThat is the first line of the movie as it begins and it stands true We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling Wow I cant say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story Now we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally recent great movie is Finding Nemo But whats special about this movie is simplicty honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into usDone by the genius Chaplin there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling we either smile or bring tears So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do are done there Winning over a fight from a neighbour meeting angels and all Now look at the editing in this less than an hour film its neat and precise The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film Acting is sublime by Chaplin only few can do what he did and even today hardly anyone can match him Its a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch atlas watch it before you die you may learn something you never wanted to miss Its / for one of the finest silent movies ever,10
274,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is one of Chaplins best films as well as one of his most famous It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by and its not hard to see why Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector a young miner during the gold rush After getting caught in a storm he hurries to the only shelter that he can find a wood cabin in the middle of the storm It turns out that it is already inhabited and by a tough criminal named Black Larson no less and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim another prospector insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film,10
275,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is pure gold  It was Charlie Chaplins third featurelength film and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris  which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp  This movie should be counted among Chaplins best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights which Ive also seen as THE best Chaplin movie but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedys immortal geniusesHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV I saw it again in October  as part of my colleges silentfilm class on a poorquality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen ,10
276,tt0015864,Charles Chaplins The Gold Rush is arguably his finest film He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich What he does not realize is that he may find love in the form of Georgia Hale instead of money In the end that may be all right with him The Gold Rush shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer writer and director he was Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the th Century Chaplin showed humanity love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career The movie is exceptional in every way Although I am not as wellversed with movies from the s as I am with the decades following it I would still probably call The Gold Rush the finest film of that year period Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today  stars out of ,0
277,tt0015864,The  Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious As an unnamed prospector Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner the dancing roles and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff His companion Big Jim McKay Mack Swain at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplins character to be a chicken and before long a bear enters their cabin In the midst of it all the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia Georgia HaleA real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!,10
278,tt0015864,To see Charlie Chaplins The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment One cannot help but enjoy a film as welldone as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered and I can see why It is a masterful blend of comedy drama and romance among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture Like all great movies The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramps flawless physical comedy He was a master of comedic timing and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians Ive ever seen Dont get me wrong this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler The film moves along at a brisk pace following the misadventures of our hero The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin of course as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska Along his journey through the elements the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen Tom Murray a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold Fortunately our friend also comes across a fellow prospector Big Jim McKay Mack Swain who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich But the Lone Prospectors adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere When he is forced back to civilization he falls in love with Georgia Georgia Hale the most beautiful girl in town Of course it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite the handsome ladys man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia as well Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the egomaniacal lady killer All of this would be too much for any one of us but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie I am a fan of Charlie Chaplins movies but as objective as I can possibly be this IS one of the great moviesEssential viewing!,10
279,tt0015864,This silent classic has many strong points  it has a lot of humor interesting characters a good story and good settings  Its the kind of film that shows how much a master filmmaker can communicate in a silent movie  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion but other than that its a fine filmChaplin himself plays the Lone Prospector and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors rickety cabins plus some other good materialThe version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin reedited in the s adding his own narration and deleting the title cards which gives it a slightly different feel  These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who arent used to silent films You can tell from Chaplins narration how fond he must have been of The Gold Rush and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art,0
280,tt0015864,Charlie Chaplins silent film also rereleased with a narration in the early s focuses as usual on the Little Tramp and in this case his attraction to a chorus girl Georgia Hale This is the one where he eats a boot along with its laces and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rollsThe role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin Lita Grey but her pregnancy ruled her out Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions Mack Swain appears as Big Jim who shares a cabin with the Tramp at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and goldrunners as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time as a sound film it is fairly good,8
281,tt0015864,Ive seen both version of this filmthe original silent version from  and the rerelease by Chaplin in the s The difference is that the rerelease was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies To do this title cards were removedhaving Chaplin narrate the film In addition Chaplincreated music for the most partsome were classical pieces sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVDit has both plus excellent DVD extras Otherwise there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out theremany with terrible quality prints or music or both The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the  rereleaseI use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film though I might in the future use it for my Psychology classes as well I teach both because Chaplins genius came from his obsessivecompulsive nature The movie reportedly had  times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than  takes!! The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century Along the way he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb Suffice to say the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch something not true of all fulllength slapstick comediessometimes their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to fulllengthThis is a gorgeous wellexecuted piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac The musical score arranged by Chaplin direction acting and cinematography all are simply perfectmaking this in my opinion the best fulllength silent comedy ever made This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keatons films!,10
282,tt0015864,If any single figure can fairly be said to symbolize the glory years of the silent filmsthe cinemas truly international epochit is Charles Chaplins indomitable tramp The Little Fellow as millions came to call him was at once tatty and debonair browbeaten and irrepressibly optimisticand he was without question the bestloved international star in all of film history His coat was too small his pants too large his mustache patently falseand the resultant silhouette instantly recognizable wherever movies were shown Charlie Chaplins tramp spoke to all walks of lifeand never more eloquently than in such silent films as The Kid and The Gold Rush The Gold Rush is superb It deals with Charlies adventures to win the affection of a local dancehall girl and his hilarious efforts to avoid being eaten by bears and by prospectors who are bigger and hungrier than he The most memorable scene is one in which he dines on an old shoe Chaplins exquisite grace turned the boiled shoe into a gourmet feast he carves it carefully smacks his lips in anticipation and then eats it with gusto and appreciation sucking the nails as if they contained the most juices and twirling the laces around his fork as if they were spaghetti,10
283,tt0015864,In Charles Chaplins  film The Gold Rush a lone prospector travels to California looking for gold and entwines himself in adventures and finds Georgia the woman of his dreams After many hardships including a relocating cabin the lone prospector played by Charles Chaplin finds gold and becomes rich ending in success and unity with Georgia The time period in which this movie was shot compared with the technological innovation and the state of the art filming techniques give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel The use of upclose shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a new feel to the style of silent cinema The scene with the cabin shifting and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin was one of the many stylistic filming techniques that gave The Gold Rush such artistic and ingenious appeal Chaplins ideas and his vision that he brought to life in the movie The Gold Rush make it a great landmark in the beginning of silent films and in film history The intricate but simple story of The Gold Rush brought about many distinct feelings when viewing It gives feelings of happiness during scenes where there is comedic relief and slapstick comedy and also can bring about sadness or pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Years but she never shows up It reveals how silent films can become in touch with a persons feelings making them feel for the protagonist without having to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot These aspects of The Gold Rush make it a milestone in the film industry of the modern world,9
284,tt0015864,One of the best Chaplin movies which means one of the best movies ever made Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as `Eating the shoe and `The Roll Dance Both the original version and the second release have their own charm,10

286,tt0015864,We follow the little fellow Chaplin in his trip to Alaska to find gold  which he ends up succeeding in finding love at the same time The first half of the movie reunites Chaplin another lonesome gold seeker and a moralless scoundrel in a shelter under a particularly horrendous snowstorm There happens one of the most memorable scene of the movie Big Jims delusion that Chaplins is a giant of course bearing Chaplins manners chicken and his desperate attempts to eat him; but Chaplin is saved by a bear showing up which they finally eat Then parting their ways begins the second half of the movie the onesided romance with the beautiful Georgia met in a dance hall How funny was the scene when she invited out of despair our little fellow to dance to avoid dancing with an invading Jake!

288,tt0015864,THE GOLD RUSH United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations So proud of his achievement Chaplin reissued this silent film in  with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself eliminating the use of title cards Then in the summer of  THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting stations week series of The Silent Years as hosted by Orson Welles from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William PerryTHE GOLD RUSH which is set in the turn of the century opens with The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin coming to Alaska A snow storm drives him into the cabin of Black Lawson Tom Murray an outlaw Big Jim McKay Mack Swain another prospector who has found gold on his claim is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin After much struggle Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests Stranded due to the heavy storm Larson finds himself chosen to go out for help While out in the storm he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him He gets away by stealing their dog sled but is later killed in an avalanche Back to the cabin Charlie and Larson almost in near starvation eventually make a meal out of a large bear When the snow storm finally subsides the two men go about their separate ways Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia Georgia Hale a dance hall girl causing jealousy from her suitor Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite As for Jim he has forgotten where his gold claim is and locates Charlie to help him find it separating him from Georgia The results that follow is classic ChaplinAside from a large list of supporting players which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis The Gold Rush contains many now classic comedy supplements including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlies encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement There are tender moments too including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Years Eve dinner with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for themWith THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplins most revived and discussed movie one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed including THE CIRCUS  CITY LIGHTS  MODERN TIMES  and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR  Since the advent of home video in the early s THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores ranging from the use of piano organ or orchestra There are even some editions that have no music track at all along with some copies running different time lengths and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout The  reissue being a shorter print with Chaplins narration not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics but can also be found on Chaplins th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a  comedy short PAY DAY Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection But in spite of numerous editions THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics  and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter  reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector avid lip readers will notice that he is called Charlie by his supporting players especially by Georgia ****,10
289,tt0015864,If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability t you a commend this film as well as City Lights  Modern Times isnt strictly speaking a silent film although Chaplin had no dialogue there  The Gold Rush while not Chaplins best film does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits it must be seen  Excellent film   version redone by Chaplin is a bit better but either will do  Most highly recommended,10
290,tt0015864,To be perfectly honest I wish I could denounce Chaplin more fervently than I find myself able to Right down to my fundamental worldview I am a Buster Keaton person the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness The world as I understand it just doesnt work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay So wishing it did only fosters more painThis is actually worst than The Kid in this respect Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold Oh though filthy rich at that point when in the end he falls practically in the girls arms he is again dressed like a tramp  meaning no doubt he is still the same person  but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul here he gets both There is not even the thought of a compromiseYet I cant help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplins cosmology; the mysterious elusive fates  seemingly random but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose  that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocksNowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside the reality thought to be known understood domesticated into order but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void So every step inside taken casually without much thought is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death Blissful ignorance the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabinIt is a powerful cosmologic symbol what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life With both gold and love impossible love with the dream girl as the chimeras that trick the mindSo Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside but either cannot properly understand – and confuses karma for providential fate  or he does is terrified and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy taleSo however wellmeant its a dishonest patronizing vision of bliss Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging but eventually benevolent whims of providence Its all made right again more than rightNotice how well integrated is this notion inside the film proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the pointofview of the tramp who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger souldefining mechanisms that shape his life that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lessonSo instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill just wait and itll all work out in the end It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the filmSure it is occasionally very funny inventive But were talking here about the more intricate mechanisms that drive a film  and film aspiring to be a truthful reflection of life life itself,0
291,tt0015864,This is the first silent film I have ever seen so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound other than the piano in the background in a  minute movie So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas acrossI felt like they did some of same gags over and over again like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove It just got really old to me quickly I dont know maybe because Im from a different time period and way life but the film just didnt do anything for me I didnt really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only  to  minutes long and nothing would have been lost,3
292,tt0015864,Make them laugh make them laugh The American comic tradition and American movies were made for each other Gold Rush is one example that Charlie Chaplin was the father of American comedy Even though Chaplin loves to press political economical or social messages in his films The Gold Rush remains true to its genre It is a comedy non the less Even at the end of the film when THE TRAMP receives a kiss Chaplin reminds the audience that she has ruined the picture with the kiss This is suppose to be a comedy!,9
293,tt0015864,Spoilers hereinI consider `City Lights to be a masterwork one of the films that every literate person must see This film is often equally celebrated but it seems to be a random collection of integrated ideas to me Some work most dontThe  rescore and voiceover is much tighter visually but sonicly heavy If you have a chance with the DVD see it in the  recut with no sound and subtitlesThe one skit that works the best is the famous dancing rolls bit You really must see three versions of this one after another Look at the original Then see the Robert Downey Jr version done in  almost  years later Notice how much more comic Downeys is because he uses a different timing and is both doing it and referencing the Chaplin dance Then see the Johnny Depp version of the year later which pokes fun at the Downey version and reannotates the original A work of genius overlain on a masterpieceOtherwise there are better silent comedies to see And better ChaplinTeds Evaluation   of  Has some interesting elements,0
294,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is a showcase of sorts for Chaplin In it he provides audiences with a wide range of cinematic elements from his signature slapstick routines to dramatic relationships The rags to riches plot was interesting and witty but felt dragged out While Chaplin is good at emotionally engaging the audience with relateable situations like getting stood up or competing for a woman the lack of serious conflict makes the film seem simple The special effects were handled nicely even by todays standards but the true enjoyment in the film comes from watching the tramp endure hardship as he accidentally progresses into wealthiness and sees his life fall together by favorable coincidence,6
295,tt0015864,Spoiler AlertThe Gold Rush is perhaps one of the best silent movies I have ever seenAlthough it takes a bit to get used to silent movie language youll be rewarded with a marvelousfunny and poignant movieSome of the scenes are hilarious and some really touches your heartstrings Chaplin as performer gives one of his best performances in this movie There are plenty of great scenesChaplin and Mack Swain in the cabincrazy with hunger and cabin feverthe touching New Years Eve party and finally the hilarious finale with the cabin out on the edge of a cliffThe later version which was released with added narration and music wasnt as good as the originalbut easier for modern audiences to watch,8
296,tt0015864,What a delightful film I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them like the eating shoe scene fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Years Eve knowing that he was stoodup I genuinely felt for him Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time Brilliant,10
297,tt0015864,The primitive production values the decrepitlooking camera work and the silent soundtrack with only musical scores to suffice for the lack of the talkie in that era does little to ruin the viewers chance of being entertained by this highly enjoyable classic masterpiece by Charlie Chaplin The Little Tramp finds himself in the Yukon braving the wintery elements bears and a psychopath all for the sake of claiming his own fortune of gold Under his expert direction Chaplin guides THE GOLD RUSH with painstaking detail of what life would be like to live in the freezing extremes having to shack up in a  cabin in danger of toppling over a snowcapped cliff and feasting on shoes for protein Amidst all the atrocities Chaplin being that likeable underdog that everybody roots for and loves overcomes the odds managing to make the best out of a bad read terrible situation He even takes the time to humor himself and a few ladies with a songanddance number involving two forks and a pair of potatoes,0
298,tt0015864,The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights?  There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator  There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramps world City Lights falls short  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what Charlot has been all about all along It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplins works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime  out of ,10
299,tt0017136,Technically speaking I have seen this Fritz Lang silent scifi before but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the s The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable apocalyptic fantasy and religious allegory It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers who toil in the depths tending the machines and the upper classes who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers The hero the idle pampered son of the citys supervisor Joh Fredersen changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria the Madonna of the workers His father meanwhile is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didnt see In addition to restoring scenes to the film the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version With these changes the story becomes much clearer particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis Perhaps most importantly a whole new subplot is added involving the heros dead mother Hel who was loved by both his father and Rotwang With this clarification of the backstory the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer In some ways it recalls the family backstory of the Star Wars movies Of course the real strength of Metropolis isnt the story which is pretty silly and probably wouldnt have worked in anything but a silent film but its amazing visuals which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to  and Blade Runner Actually though in most respects silent films now look primitive one area in which they have the edge over modern filmmaking is in their frequently grandiose production design Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world The models of the citys towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a s film Even beyond the expansive production design and for the time special effects Langs visuals are all consistently inventive The robot Maria provides some of the movies most iconic images including her transformation into a human being In a later scene she performs for upperclass men in a nightclub and as she performs a striptease that in s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs A sign of Langs visual lavishness and the studios that he doesnt hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a characters state of mind For instance when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idols head into which the workers are being sacrificed At another point while hes sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs labor parable and Lang gives us spectacular images of the towers construction and fall In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and overliteral but theyre what silent cinema does best tell a story without the advantage or obstacle of dialogue The story is a little slow to start but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that Ive seen In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films as the workers riot and sabotage the machines endangering the entire city Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than  years,9
300,tt0017136,Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the s? Sure some science fiction movies are huge today such as George Lucas latest goofy Star Wars movie but in  Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then And sure enough we went right ahead living the way we were living the population got bigger and more crowded and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society Metropolis was run by his father John Frederson the master of Metropolis He lives in a Pleasure Garden high above the level of the workers and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father given the terrible conditions under which they live and work Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic sinister looking machine The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devillooking monster  After countless workers are consumed by it no wonder this was Hitlers favorite film they are immediately replaced by other workers who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements If some of these scenes men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured and the rest of the workers keep right on working hardly even noticingThe way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated `Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups is a saying that doesnt necessarily only apply to stupid people as Metropolis suggests Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue and the result is still compelling today The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways except that the two films can hardly be compared  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least An excellent film Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten,10
301,tt0017136,I doubt that Id ever seen anything resembling a complete version of METROPOLIS before though certain of its scenes were familiar to me if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keatons HEAVEN   In any case whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration  I expected to be distracted by the restorations technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it  As exaggerated as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards some performances such as the Master of the city are amazingly nuanced and layered and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone The meticulous design of the film the unerring camera placement and Langs muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking Id thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity important = dull but now Ive come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been,10
302,tt0017136,Fritz Langs Metropolis is the first true masterpiece of science fiction in film You can see its influence in films such as Star Wars The Matrix Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Blade Runner and countless others Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were in some cases phenomenal I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is  years old because a lot has happened in film since then Yet if you look at the basic elements of this movie  its story characters artwork cinematography etc I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late s Also take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this The performances and set designs are going to be over the top That was part of the style Metropolis may not be for everyone but for those willing to read between the lines this film still has a lot to offer!,8
303,tt0017136,In the future the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes the workers who live in the underground below the machines level and the dominant classes that lives on the surface The workers are controlled by their leader Maria Brigitte Helm who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles Maria meets Freder Fredersen Gustav Fröhlich the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen Alfred Abel in a meeting of the workers and they fall in love for each other Meanwhile Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate themMetropolis is a fantastic futuristic view of the fight of classes When Metropolis was shot it was a romantic revolutionary period of mankind history with socialist movements around the world Fritz Lang directed and wrote the screenplay of this masterpiece certainly inspired in this historical moment and defending a position of agreement and understanding between both sides showing that they need each other I wonder how this great director was able to produce such special effects in  with very primitive cameras and equipment The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art My vote is tenTitle Brazil MetropolisNote On  March  I saw this film again on BluRay,10
304,tt0017136,Metropolis is surely one of the greatest films ever made  Its scope its reach its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by todays standards of filmmaking  Seen in context of its premier in  Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history  Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great and in particular Metropolis  A great film is one that stirs the imagination leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life and achieves a kind of immortality  Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria  Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings halluciatory scenes and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions  There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria  Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups  Lastly Metropolis has stood the test of time  It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre  The story itself is simplea Biblical allegory about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen  The film is anything but simple  It is immense and a rich legacy that director Fritz Lang has left us,0
305,tt0017136,I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie This is without a doubt the best scifi movie Ive ever seen! Let me explain my position We have all seen modern scifi movies and argued over which is the best ever made but those film makers have high speed film and computers Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in  and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must see for all persons interested in the history of film as well as just good fun for everyone The social metaphores as well as the religious and philosophical double meanings are a sight to behold,10
306,tt0017136,This must be one of the greatest movies of all time I found myself almost in a state of shock during the whole movie Everything was perfect The story was great the filming was pure genius and the effects directly from another dimensionI dont think any movie after this one have gotten so much out of the available effects of the time as this one Nowadays they have super computers generating special effects Sure they look good but its no big deal making them Back in  computers werent even invented yet all effects had to be done by hand or in simple editing And when you take a look at all the thins that have been done in this movie its impossible not to get impressed Huge buildings explosions flooding picture phones however did he come up with the very idea? transformation sequences robots and so on No movie has ever pulled the limits of special effects as much as this one Star Wars and Jurassic Park are also known as limit pullers in special effects but they dont even come closeThen you have the filming Everything is perfect The use of body language is tremendous the light setting perfect everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera Ive never been witness to such a treat in filming other placesAnd the story!!! Perfect in every detail Intriguing exciting and thrilling with lots of religious undertones and tyranic leaders No wonder Hitler liked this movieI dont know how the original music of the film was but the new music for the restored  minute version I saw was really good and moodsetingAll in all This is one of the most perfect movies of all time and it deserves anything it can get Never has a / been as secure as for this movie,10
307,tt0017136,Silent movies are not for everyone Neither are subtitles Those brave enough to view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between should definitely enjoy this silent masterpiece One of the biggest productions of its time Metropolis still holds its own when set design and special effects are compared But what Metropolis really has is orginality This GermanExpressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future modern city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern scifi Star Warss CPO was based on Bridgette Helms robot Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis lookalike cities This is a very good movie Its too bad most movies dont have its originality,9
308,tt0017136,Fritz Langs groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema How can a movie thatll soon turn  years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages The world has been divided into two main categories thinkers &amp; workers! If you belong to the first category you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if youre a worker your life isnt worth a penny and youre doomed to perilous labor underground The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself Its essential viewing anyway! Metropolis is a very demanding filmexperience and definitely not always entertaining But as it is often the case with silentcinema classics the respect and admiration youll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoymentaspect Fritz brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to recreate a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines Many supposedly restored versions have been released over the years in  and  for example but the version is still the finest in my opinion even though that one already isnt as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it Metropolis perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made  A Space Odyssey Star Wars and Blade Runner owe their existence or at least their power to it,8
309,tt0017136,Metropolis is my alltime favourite movie so Ive saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb Ive enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies Ive seen but now Im moving on to other passionsAlthough written by Fritz Langs wife Thea von Harbou Metropolis was originally Langs idea he was inspired by the sight of New Yorks skyscrapers when he sailed to America in  During his American trip he visited the set of The Phantom of the Opera and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasnt filmedDespite its epic power Metropolis makes very little sense The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen so why is the one named Freder*sen* the father not son of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwangs crude little cottage the only preFredersen building that wasnt demolished during the construction of this city? Von Harbous very long and unwieldy novelisation of her script establishes this fact but never explains it How and why did Rotwangs hightech laboratory manage to get constructed BENEATH that cottage without disturbing it?For modern viewers some of the plots incoherence can be blamed on missing footage particularly in American prints The distributors for this films original Stateside release commissioned playwright Channing Pollock to translate the German titles A major subplot of the backstory features a deceased woman named Hel who was married to Rotwang but left him to marry Fredersen and give birth to Freder This unseen womans name could not easily be changed for the American version due to a couple of shots of her memorial engraved with the Teutonic name HEL Apparently Pollock feared that American viewers would be offended by this words similarity to Hell so he simply excised the entire subplot from this long movieThe reallife drama on the set of Metropolis mustve been quite interesting in itself Mad scientist Rotwang alias Doctor Strangeglove is played by actor Rudolf KleinRogge who had been married to scenarist von Harbou before she left him to marry Fritz Lang the mastermind of this film In Metropolis Rotwangs wife left him to marry the master of Metropolis Id love to know how KleinRogge felt about the fact that his reallife marital and sexual situation was the inspiration for key plot elements of this movie  and I wonder how KleinRogge felt about knowing that the entire cast and crew knew this as wellMost astonishing about this gargantuan production is the fact that nearly all of Metropolis was actually built to scale with just a couple of miniaturesTrivia tidbit actress Brigitte Helm was cast in the dual female role largely because she was flatchested and therefore she could easily fit inside the mechanical suit for the Robotrix A more busty actress would have suffered constant discomfort inside those galvanised bosoms of the metal costume I learnt this more than  years ago from an eldery Austrian stagehand who worked on the filmFor all its flaws Metropolis will always be my favourite movie Ive enjoyed writing all these reviews for IMDb The joy of posting my reviews on this site has brought me many friendships and a few enemies Well you cant win em allNitrate film stock doesnt last forever and all good things come to a happy ending This is my last review here Ill keep watching movies but other passions are important to me as well Thank you IMDb and thank you to everyone who has read my reviews I will happily rate Metropolis a full  out of ,10
310,tt0017136,One definitely cant fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Langs vision even if as always with depictions of the future there are a few forgivable blind spots The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the s as are the flyingmachines that buzz about them; while the business dress of tomorrows rulers unlike their exotic leisure wear doesnt appear to have advanced one iota!HGWells criticised the film for its adherence to arty image over scientific rigour and as a piece of coherent science fiction its certainly as lacking as he claimed The machines exist to appear awesome and to torment their workers rather than to perform any apparent task and there is no explanation of how this society functions how it evolved or how it is sustained let alone of the incongruities that must surely lie behind such anomalous locations as the catacombs and the cathedral But Wells own futuristic film Things to Come conceived in direct riposte to Langs unscientific approach is tedious and talky as a result didactic in its heavyfooted philosophy and explanations and lacking in artistic vision Metropolis may be soft SF but its approach undoubtedly makes for better cinemaI am not however impressed by it as a film Masterpiece of Modernism it may be  but great design and special effects cant save todays bigbudget clunkers from deficiencies of character and plot and they dont save this one Ironically I suspect that its reputation has benefited greatly from its being the only silent film many of its viewers have ever encountered reading through the IMDb pages I see wellmeaning comments like Great  when you consider how primitive cinema was in  and once you get used to the fact that it takes about ten gestures to convey one sentence It wasnt  and it doesnt!As silent films go this is in many places agonizingly slow and repetitious marred by clumsy acting tendentious titles and overwrought gestures By the late s cinema had progressed far beyond this laboured pantomime in Langs case the heavy stylisation may have been a deliberate choice but compared to the fluidity of contemporaries such as Sjostroms The Wind or The Scarlet Letter Asquiths Underground or Shooting Stars and Murnaus Sunrise the film comes across as ten years behind the times The problem is not necessarily with the actors  Brigitte Helm as has been observed does an excellent job in differentiating her two characters  but with the direction and pacingWe saw the restored version with the original Gottfried Huppertz score; the latter didnt always seem to fit too well with pops jumps and awkward silences but this was I assume due either to the difficulty of fitting it to allow for the missing material or to problems in the projection booth when running a newlyarrived print for the first time However the painstaking summary of the various missing scenes only ended up increasing my appreciation of what a good job had been done in the editingdown in the first place! To take a single example where the edited version conveys Freders sudden recollection that he is supposed to be the workers longawaited mediator via the simple juxtaposition of three shots  the shiftchange whistle announcing the meeting the catacombs and Freder suddenly struck by an idea and rushing off  the restoration betrays the fact that a couple of scenes of mimed dialogue were originally provided to spell out the message at painstaking lengthIt is interesting to see how it was done but most of the cuts are either an improvement or a very clever abridgement and by and large I didnt feel that what was omitted had been any great loss In fact frankly I felt that the film was in need of further editing at certain points such as Rotwangs pursuit of Maria through the catacombs She screams and runs and screams and runs and is pursued by a searchlight effect; its clever selfconsciously clever the first couple of times but the repetition becomes tedious to the point of caricature Plot infelicities abound in increasing numbers culminating in the infamous Hunchback of Notre Damestyle ending where the mad scientist carries off the girl across the roof of the cathedral hotly pursued by Our Hero which raised giggles in a hitherto serious and respectful audience with which I couldnt help but sympathiseThis is a film to see once in a lifetime so that you can say that you have seen it  not least because most of the impact lies in the visuals But its all surface and no substance the characters act arbitrarily the plot is subservient to the Message the pacing is like treacle the storytelling technique is primitive and really all it has going for it is the visual flair and the special effects I quite honestly believe that this work would be better appreciated as a set of stills in a glossy brochure; an exhibit in a design exhibition This is not cinema as I love it  its innovative it may be Art but as an actual film its only a poor shadow,6
311,tt0017136,There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator This is the predominant theme of Metropolis and director Fritz Lang finds numerous ways to say and visualize his message during the course of the film The movie relies on repeated visual imagery to make its point and does so effectively even if tedious at times Particularly effective is the representation of the worker society as an almost single living unit moving trance like to their appointed time and task The use of a ten hour clock in the workers chamber constantly draws our attention as does the hangdog posture of the individual slaves who grind out their workday as if in a dazeAmid this rabble worker Maria Brigitte Helm is the inspirational voice of the workers offering hope for a brighter future by a mediator yet to appear However the Master of Metropolis John Frederson Alfred Abel sees in her a way to quell the underlying frustration of the workers commissioning his scientist Rotwang to create a robot Maria to plant discord among the workers Rotwangs laboratory would have done Frankenstein proud and the creation of the robot is a marvel of cinematic imagery The robot Marias belly dance transforms into a scene of such raw energy and sexual awareness that it awakens the statues of the Seven Deadly Sins one of the master strokes of this expressionist filmSo much imagery in fact is layered into Metropolis that its safe to say that repeat viewings will lead to even more interpretations of its vision and not simply for its denunciation of a class society Both timely and timeless the film captures a dynamism that inspires passion even after nearly eighty years following its original release,8
312,tt0017136,I really hate it when I dont enjoy a classic film I really want to enjoy it but I just cant I want to understand some peoples love for it but I just cant Metropolis falls under this category An unbearably slow film I watched the restoration which is over  hours longthat may have been a bad idea that starts off with interesting ideas but then seems to not really do much with them It is the year  the wealthy rule the city of Metropolis while the lowerclass work for hours on end underground in awful conditions The Master of Metropolis is Joh Fredersen Alfred Abel and his son is Freder Gustav Frohlich who spends his days with other rich people in a place called the pleasure garden where he truly does nothing at all A woman named Maria Brigitte Helm brings a group of working children up for a visit in pleasure garden and Freder is quickly enamored by Maria Freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shocked as an explosion goes off and kills multiple workers He reports this to his father who is disappointed his son was the first to report it over his assistant Josepha Theodor Loos and his assistant is quickly fired This does an immediate job of showing the coldness of Joh but they never do much else with his character In fact very little of the characters are developed in anyway Most of them are completely uninteresting and the setting itself is compelling at first but quickly loses anything interesting halfway through the film as the film moves at a snail pace Anyways the main aspect of the plot here is that the workers are led by Maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of a mediator to make it happen My real issue is that the film starts with such a great idea and had potential to become something like  Im aware it came out afterwords and that its a novel but still just an example but it instead becomes filled with strange religious allusions and becomes a witch hunt essentially by the end They never really do any decent social commentary at all If any at all This wouldnt matter if the film was actually entertaining but it only is in spurts and then quickly becomes a repetitive bore I do think the special effects were impressive and this film is obviously important for being the first full length science fiction filmwell ever That doesnt mean it holds up because it doesnt In fact itd be hard for me to believe the film was entertaining in  I still wonder if I had watched the shorter version of the film how much more I wouldve enjoyed the film It certainly wouldve have been paced better considering so much of this film is unbelievably uninteresting But I dont think that changes the fact that this movie doesnt really do anything It isnt entertaining It doesnt really have a message What is this movie? I guess good special effects for ? Whatever Im glad I gave this classic a chance but I highly doubt Ill revisit it anytime soon,4
313,tt0017136,This review contains Spoilers But since the story is by far the least reason to watch Metropolis feel free to still read it even if you havent watched it yetMetropolis is a film that was far ahead of its time It influenced a great lot of sciencefiction films and how The Blade Runner Batman or Dark City would look like if there wasnt Metropolis  who knows Even The Matrix Reloaded is heavily inspired by this classic that is as old as my grandmother Now what is it all about? About Freder the son of the head of the city of Metropolis a Christlike figure who falls in love with the preacher of the working class a saintlike woman who happens to be named Maria When a robot who is modeled to look like Maria makes the workers almost extinguish their city and their children Maria and Freder save the children and in the end Freder makes his father and the workers cooperate for a brighter futureSounds silly to you? Yes and thats exactly what the story is silly Thats also the reason why still today Metropolis isnt accepted as the masterpiece it is by a few film buffs But these people dont understand one thing A good film does more than only tell a story A film can be great even without a story at all and a silly story combined with amazing visuals can make you forget all the other weaknesses a film has And wow what amazing images Metropolis offers What an art direction! What wonderful special effects! And remember as I already said this film is as old as my grandmother! Just have a look at the workers They hardly ever seem to be individuals In the mass scenes they look like one big creature moving forward or backwards When they are working they look more like machines than like human beings whereas the machines resemble monsters more than they do technical devices best seen in the moments when Freder hallucinates and sees the big machine as a workereating Moloch We also see a worker and later Freder work on a machine that looks like a clock with  blinking light bulbs doing some that looks as exhausting as it looks senseless Or think of Rotwang the mad inventor who lives in a little hut that looks in this film like it was from another world He has a black prosthesis for his right hand its not a coincidence that Stanley Kubrick gave his mad scientist/inventor Dr Strangelove a prosthesis for his right hand too He builds the robot that he makes to look like Maria and that transformation scene is one of the most magnificent scenes ever and looks more convincing than some scenes of modern scifi flicks I also have to mention Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and the robot  and the look in her eyes would already be enough to tell which of her characters is on screen at the moment If something like awards already would have been given in the s she sure would have walked home with quite a bunch of them And just look at her sexy dance! It is just as memorable as the shot of the many eyes watching her dance  or the many faces watching her preach just a few minutes later Metropolis is a film no scififan should miss I had the good luck that my first viewing of Metropolis one year ago was in a cinema when it was a rereleased after its restoration I can only recommend you to watch it in a cinema if you have the possibility to as Metropolis is just as   A Space Odyssey one of those rare films that are masterpieces on your TV set but a revelation on the big screen,10
314,tt0017136,I was very anxious to see Metropolis for the first time I had been into silent movies for a couple of years but hadnt had the opportunity to see Fritz Langs classic I finally saw it at a silent movie theater in Hollywood and my feelings were to say the least mixedThe film is visually stunning Monumental sets brilliantly directed scenes amazing special effects by the standards of the time In fact I might say that I was more enthralled by the visual effects of this movie than I was by say Lord of the Rings or Avatar Whereas Cameron and Jackson used CGI to make their visions come true; Lang had to use camera trickery paint and woodThis movie no doubt set the lexicon for the SciFi and blockbuster genre in stone The images of Metropolis have been repeated in innumerable movies The scene of the underground city being flooded has curious similarities to James Camerons Titanic Even the villainous Rotwang can be seen in the characters Dr Strangelove and Doc Brown from Back to the FutureBut then theres the story And the dialogue And the acting which is overwrought even by the standards of the time But I dont have enough room to go into thatStarting with the opening line LookThese are your brothers a violent cringe would run through my body every time the intertitles would appearThe later line about the head and hands needing the heart as mediator caused a huge outburst of laughter in the theater This serves as the basis for the moral of the story which was eerily similar to How the Grinch Stole Christmas Essentially it can boiled down to this Somebody according to writer Thea von Harbous later beliefs this turned out to be Adolf Hitler needs to appeal to the hearts of capitalist managers and tell them to be nice to their workers The outcome is a grudging handshake between the head manager Joh Frederson and the leader of the workers Grot; and thus begins a shining new day!Metropolis also incorporates religious symbolism which is to say the very least heavyhanded Scenes of the Seven Deadly Sins The Tower of Babel an altar to Moloch and the Flood all warn of doom to decadent societies that exploit the weak and kill the righteousIn the end this muddled mixture of Socialist calls for justice and Christian Apocalypticism creates a political message that Lang himself described as sillyI recommend this film for its artistic brilliance and groundbreaking techniques But dont go into this expecting an award quality filmIf you want to get into silent film this is a relatively easy one to get start with However I dont know if thats a good or a bad thing Ive met too many people whove said that Metropolis was the best silent movie theyve ever seen; which probably means that it was the only one that they ever bothered to watch I would recommend Sunrise or City Lights as a first over this,5
315,tt0017136,Francis Ford Coppola once said that Apocalypse Now wasnt just about Vietnam is was Vietnam In a similar way Metropolis isnt just about the Twentieth Century it is the Twentieth Century Almost every image in it reflects or more often predicts the realities of life in the West over the past hundred years in a way that is truly uncannyFrom small details  the traffic jams and blackouts that plague city dwellers  to major historical events  the climactic flood predicts every industrial disaster that has destroyed the lives of thousands of workers from Chernobyl to the Bhopal disaster whilst Fredersens vision of workers being fed to Moloch cant help but bring to mind the holocaust  Metropolis feels prescient in any number of ways In the image of the Manhattan skyline Lang really did find the perfect symbol of the coming century  progressive new faceless oppressiveThis is far from the simple Marxist fable it is often taken for  although the Socialist message can hardly be ignored Its also a Christian parable Maria flanked by crosses is counterbalanced by the Machine brought to life under a pentagram informed by the book of Revelation; a retelling of the Orpheus myth with Freder as Orpheus and Maria as Eurydice lost in the underworld; and a Kafkaesque nightmare of depersonalisation although the Gothic expressionistic production design is a long way from Kafkas more sterile styleIts also lest we forget a silly adventuremelodrama with a mad scientist an evil twin a bad father with a noble son and an impossibly virtuous idealised heroine In many ways it anticipates Star Wars in dressing up mythic standards with Science Fiction tropes  with Fredersen as the misguided King Freder as the handsome Prince Maria the goodhearted peasants daughter Rotwang as a scheming sorcerer and the Machine as the wicked witch appropriately burnt at the stake by the villagersThe MachineMan a confusing name for a construction so obviously feminine is the single most indelible image of the film; the scene in which Rotwang brings her to life for the first time is a real moment of magic and awe untarnished by eighty subsequent years of cinematic showmanship Even better is the scene in which she becomes a duplicate of Maria  such an obvious influence on James Whales Frankenstein that its hard not to shout out Its alive! The optical effects are years ahead of their time certainly the best of their kind until the sixties at least It also marks the beginning of Brigitte Helms truly extraordinary turn as the false MariaThis is only the third silent film Ive seen after Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and its taken me a while to acclimatise to the acting style which can seem close to parody What it really reminds me of however is modern dance which similarly seeks to communicate with the audience visually rather than verbally Metropolis encourages this comparison with the highly choreographed movements of the workers operating the machinery Bearing this in mind Helm is hugely impressive in multiple roles Maria could be a rather dull and virtuous heroine she enters the film surrounded by poor children in rags but Helm invests her with enormous energy and expressiveness It helps that the script allows her to take an unusually proactive role for a female character organising workers meetings and racing to the rescue of the endangered children However it is her performance as bad Maria vamping up a storm that lingers in the memory  the twitching jerking movements of her head and body the Anne Robinson style halfwink that changes the shape of her face that malicious little grin that makes it hard not to root for her mischief The entirely weird erotic dance that she performs isnt technically very good or erotic but it is utterly unforgettable Subtextually shes the Whore of BabylonThe other performances are mainly very good particularly Alfred Abel as Fredersen proving that it is possible to underplay in a silent film Only Rudolf KleinRogge hits any wrong notes  difficult as it undoubtedly must be to play a mad scientist in a silent film with subtlety some of his more unrestrained gesticulations leave you worried about the safety of the other actorsUltimately though it all inevitably comes back to the imagery Langs film remains unmatched even today Pick a scene any scene  the synchronised shuffling crowds at the shift change; our first sighting of the Metropolis all biplanes skyscrapers and suspended motorways; the vision of Moloch; the MachineMan awakening; Maria pursued along a pitchblack tunnel by a beam of light; the statue of Death coming to life in the Cathedral; disembodied eyes entranced by the twitching false Maria; the crowds swarming up the steps in the Tower of Babel section; the lifts crashing down one by one; desperate children crowding around Maria as the floodwaters close in; and most of all false Maria laughing as she burns on her pyre then transforming back to her metal visage No film before or since matches this for spectacle And if in order to appreciate it you have to swallow a little treacle about the heart being the mediator between head and hands well trust me its worth it,9
316,tt0017136,We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Langs Metropolis are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upperclass and operated by slavelike poor The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan These elements can be found in this films ancestors Frankenstein Batman Gattaca and the cities of Blade Runner Star Wars and The Fifth Element All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Langs workMetropolis has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes After its success in  the film has had an uneasy time Its pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in  Unless a lost version surfaces as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentinos  film Beyond the Rocks the complete work my never be seen again The restored version released on DVD in  was based on a digital restoration at K resolution from all available sources Its the best version that Ive seen and I would highly recommend that one if you havent seen the film The worst is a  print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration the film in grainy and difficult to see it doesnt even have a soundtrack I call that one the worst because Im still a little ambivalent about the  restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting good sound effects not so good and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy Freddy Mercury Bonnie Tyler Adam Ant and Pat Benatar yuck!Those who study the film myself included find the story impenetrable Some films you can easily decipher but Metropolis has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that its hard to pin it down as a whole Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the films chaotic nature It takes place in the future restored versions offer title cards that suggest that its the year  but I dont go by that in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers the Gothic sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives dancing in their penthouses and spending their money The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step They dont so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses slaves building his pyramids The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another One person that isnt ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his officeHis son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the workers children Curious he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there The woman is Maria a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be foundFreder uncovers a plot by Rotwang the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms This leads to the films most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzyThen all Hell breaks loose but the rest I must leave to you to discoverLang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film and therefore less successful the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers At one point Freder disguised as a worker witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen Another suggests an odd device a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around its edge The machine doesnt seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless dayThe film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism astonishing in its use of light and shadow One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in Another brilliant moment comes with Marias erotic dance as the men gawk the camera filled with their moist eyes This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home videoOther moments have deeper resonance There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves Walking to work they march with their heads down dressed in uniforms and caps It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler More obvious are Langs biblical references The rise of the city parallels Marias retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel The giant pentagram in Rotwangs lab as he plays God The breathtaking image of the plaguebringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself There is even a Christlike quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakersThese elements and images are brought to the film because of Langs insistence on no less then absolute perfection He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster working his cast and crew like a dictator He cast some  extras  of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone and worked them from morning till night The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with himI could go on and on this film all great films invite lengthy discussions It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over But when you get down to it the best way to view Metropolis is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of its time Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad,0
317,tt0017136,This truly is a classic masterpiece and honestly one of the best movies ever made The story is brilliant and the visuals amazingI have seen the German  minutes version of the movie without subtitles Yes its a long watch but its worth every second of it Basically only reason why the movie is so long is because they need about ten hand gestures to speak one sentence Its kind of dreadful to look at first but once youre used to it it shouldnt trouble you anymoreIn many ways this movie can be regarded as the Blade Runner of the s Metropolis is set in a futuristic world that has a same kind of atmosphere as in Blade Runner The mix of s cars and propellerplanes with futuristic machines highways buildings and androids is very unusual but an absolutely awesome thing to look at The movie was ahead of its time and in some ways also propheticThe story is absolutely the best thing of the movie Also the way the story is told and directed by Fritz Lang deserves credit The story is tense and has quite some symbolism layers and storylines but remains always easy to follow The ending is truly spectacular and tense The way how spectacular and tense the ending and the entire movie in general was really surprised me in a positive wayThe sets are obviously fake and miniatures at times but they still manage to convince and impress Further more the movie is filled with some fantastic and very convincing early special effectsMan who also deserves credit is Alfred Abel Wow what a great actor he was in this movieAn absolute must see and one of the best movies of all time/http//bobafettblogspotcom/,10
318,tt0017136,MetropolisMetropolis is one of the most exciting and exceptional works of art that humankind has produced This epic science fiction film is one of Germanys famous silent movies created by Fritz Lang and liberated in  the period between the two World WarsThis movie represents the expressionist cinema and shows us the repression of human needs by the machine age Langs creation of a selfdestructive society is a protest against the machine age Metropolis is one of the most magnificent cities of  is kept alive by the unceasing work of the underground people who live in slavery and is enjoyed by wealthy and educated people The Austrian director of the movie Fritz Lang presents the story of a master John Federsen who sees people as machines working constantly to maintain the luxury and technology of his metropolis On the other side his son Freder falls in love with one of the underground workers who is a spiritual leader for the slaves The son recognizes the unsentimental heart of his father and starts a revolution The city gets flooded and Maria Freders love regains the workers trust after a robot had stolen her identity she finds her loved one after saving the citys children and the workers shake hands with the masterExpressionism tries to simplify the world and to understand it emotionally in a subjective way It is very important to understand this definition of this dynamic violent and distorted movement in order to understand that Lang tried to externalize his own internal vision of the world through simple expressions The name metropolis comes from the Greeks and means mothercity It has this significance because a metropolis is the biggest form of a technologically and economically developed city Nevertheless referring to the movie name this film can be considered as the mother city of all cinematic clichés In this story there are two main characters Maria and Freder These two characters are also the heroes of the story because they are the ones who rescue the population from being drowned in the flood John Federson is a person full of empowering feelings who only thinks of himself and of his city forgetting about the ones who work for him All the fantasies that he has come true through the power of his workers but he never thinks about the danger they are in while working for him This man wants so much power that he is almost hypnotized by it; he is obsessed and possessed by the power of inventions and creationsOn the other hand Maria is just a symbol of munificence her soul is pure and she is seen like an angel who brings peace to the world Maria convoys the people in a church settling area She is shown as sanctity a holy person that is surrounded by the light of the candles She is positioned higher than the workers who carefully listen to her as she speaks about peace unity and their salvation by a mediator that will soon come Her eyes inspire confidence and kindness as she kisses Freder in the church scene In general all she does is for the good of humanity One thing that she repeats in the movie is Between the head and hands there must be a heart  This means that she realizes the bad things that the head John Frederson does and the good things that the hands workers do But she knows that these workers should not be treated poorly or like robots and that she can be the heart which can persuade the head and the hands to cooperate to come to common interests Maria as her name suggests is also a biblical motif She explains to the workers the story of the Tower of Babel The workers in the story destroy this tower which parallels how the movie will end with the destruction of the machines by the workforce Maria is still the representation of Jesus mother because she is trying to save the lives of the underground children She would sacrifice herself and alike Mother Mary she has a strong faith in the creator of the world All the scenes of this film are perfectly created at the eye level so that anyone is able to view the action However there is also a birds eye view at the beginning of the movie as the panorama of the city is shown from high above the ground This view was created to give us an impression of how widely extended and huge Metropolis is In addition the focus of the dramatic camera angles with bold shadows is on the disproportioned landscape as well as on the rightangled buildings There are moments in which the camera focuses on fast movement scenes like the dancing of the robot in the nightclub and scenes where it focuses on slow movement like in the beginning of the film where the slaves are shown going into the working area at a certain pace and aligned as robots When more people are involved in a scene like the one in which all the children are surrounding Maria as she rings the danger bell the angles are vertical triangular but when only one person is focused there is a closeup to allow us to read that characters expressions and feelings A good example would be the closeups on the master Fredersons eyes as he asks his secretary why his son was allowed to go underground and as well after that scene when he is thinking in order to suggest this dictators meditation and frustration Another important aspect of the camera and of Expressionism that I have remarked was the scene in which the mad scientist tries to run away from Freder and kidnaps Maria He is walking up on the roof of a sharpangled building holding Maria under his arm as if nothing would happen The same scene was notable in Robert Wienes film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari as Cesare walks up on the roof with the kidnapped fiancé and the city crowd follows himTime also is significant in the film because the clock keeps showing up in the most important scenes Time is evident in Fredersons office as his son challenges him to have mercy for the people as well as he is talking to his secretary Still only a small portion of the clock is shown in these shots and it means the time in which the master can think what decisions to take On the other hand a gigantic clock is shown as Freder finds an exhausted worker trying to turn a wallclock Freder understands the struggle of this man and replaces him There is where he finds out that at  pm Maria will have a meetingBut all that we have seen in this movie is not only made to show us the great importance of this silent SF film that can keep the watcher alive by its impressive music and can inspire contemporary movies like Matrix  but for its great historical importance Fritz Lang expressed a social life in this movie as well as a political one After WWI when Germany had lost a war peoples lives were a disaster Everyone was disoriented and could not keep up with the tragedy that was going on and maybe there were some influences of the great antiSemitism that was supposed to follow But Germany was a great disaster as well and there was nothing it could have done to prevent it because many troubles kept adding up over the years and this country had to be defeated morally and politically as well as economically Even if Germanys wish of reconstruction was as utopic as Fredersens wish of a technological city the postwar inflation had a big contribution on cinemas development,0
319,tt0017136,I typically dont like silent films but I decided to watch this one for two reasons  First I usually like scifi movies and second Metropolis had received so many glowing reviews that I couldnt pass it up  However my opinion of this film is below what most reviewers have been sayingKinos digitally remastered version on DVD is very impressive  The sound and picture quality are both excellent  However I have to conclude that favorable reviews of this film are likely based on nostalgia on the films influence on future films and on the incredible visual effects given its year of release  Film history buffs and silent film fans should see this movie  I thought this was a good film but not a great one  A rating of  is much too high and at # there are plenty of better films ranked below itFirst the good parts of the film  The special effects are excellent for a pres film  The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work the decisions they make and in how easily they are led/misled  The main character is well developed throughout the film and the audience can relate to him well  The film is visually stunning and impressive  The story of the working class vision of the future machinemen etc have had a very strong influence on many films which came later,4
320,tt0017136,For its time this movie has stunning visuals kind of Kubrickesqe in appearance especially the opening scenes of workers going and coming from work Its very strange with the group leaving walking with their heads down like zombiesThe set designs in here are also something that might draw your attention This really has a futuristic look I thought the visuals were fascinating This was German expressionist filmwork at its height I would think Director Fritz Lang went on to become a very famous man in his profession This wasnt his first effort but I think this might have been the film that put him on the map so to speak Several years later he gained a lot more fame with M At any rate with the photography sets and overall Flash Gordontype scifi look this must have been a real eyeopener to movies viewers  years ago I still think they look very cool today The music was also very dramatic at least in this restored  surround sound restoration DVD put out by KlinoObviously the eye makeup on men and the exaggerated motions by actors in silent films look a little hokey but I was mesmerized by Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and her evil clone She is something else! I also appreciated Klinos explanation of lost footage and how they did the best they could do to still make the story flow together They did an outstanding job I wouldnt attempt to watch this on anything less than this DVD which looks pretty darn goodThis is a worker story about a man wanting to trade his comfortable life to join the oppressed workers who do their thing beneath the earth in Metropolis Workers are seen as nothing but replaceable robots If someone gets hurt they get carted away and replaced immediately but some other zombielike human Of course people being mistreated can only take it for so long before rebellion Thats history from the days of the Jewish slaves in Egypt to today so thats part of this story too I wont say more to ruin itI dont want to mislead people on one major point todays audiences watching this Few people in  watch silent movies To ask them to sit through two hours of a silent film is obviously asking a lot I had to break this up into several viewings myself but thats okay I still enjoyed itbut it a silent movie this long is not easy to sit through You have to be a student of film or a big film buff to watch thisbut those people will be rewarded Over  reviews in here show you this film has enough to offer or at least take a look Now that this restored version is available check it out!,7
321,tt0017136,OK first of all Im not some kind of actionjunkie who thinks that the Rambotrilogy is the best movies of all time I am a person who think that other silents like Nosferatu and The Battleship Potemkin are entertainingAlthough I loved the previous movies referred to I thought this was one of the most dull movies ever As entertainment this movie cant go very far On a scale rating its abilities to entertain it gets a / from meAs a milestone in the history of movies it goes all the way to the top The special effects were great to have been made almost  years ago The editing was great It must have been one of the most expensive movie made to that date On the scale of how important a chapter in the cinematic history this is I will rate it a / That means a total / This also means that you should rather check out really good silents like Chaplins Modern Times Eisensteins The Battleship Potemkin and Murnaus Nosferatu,8
322,tt0017136,Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium and his  opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format a fully restored print on the KINO DVD filled with intertitles to keep the story complete that had me appreciate it more but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music ie Giorgio Moroders experimental cut it would still be affecting At the core of the story Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou the sides of good vs evil or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak is set up so strongly that even when it has its fairytale type of heaviness to it it doesnt seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults This is the kind of film that should work for anyone young and old as it deals with universal themes ie The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!The story leaves room for the visual style to come through Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis Joh Frederson He feels the sorrow and pain of the people and goes down to their level to be one of them He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women Maria played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm in multiple roles she plays without a fault who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freders father Enter the robot a marvel of a mad scientist who gets transposed from Maria and becomes the havocwrecker of the part of Metropolis I wont reveal too much of the story except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lapAmidst in all of this Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects cameratricks and of course editing if I wouldnt quite rank Metropolis in my alltime top ten favorites I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day cars moving on roads built to the sky airplanes flying everywhich way and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways But its not just the use of the models or the sets or the backdrops or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Langs shots which are all spectacular its also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene it also appears in other scenes I think Its little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages the superimpositions of faces and eyes in the dreamlike shotsAnd of course Langs greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story he goes beyond his time period in stylizing As I mentioned with the pacing being unique it was surprising though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M that many of the suspense sequences mob scenes/riots chases I knew that this is the same kind of styling thats used today for many of the most modern of sciencefiction/action films In its own way much like Stanley Kubricks  Space Oddysey it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling while not completely abandoning the storytelling form Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries and it hasnt been seen in its full form in almost eighty years what remains doesnt seem at all dated or crude Quite the opposite its visual expressiveness its use of time and character and action and its deliberate pacing makes it ahead of its time and influential and at the same time keeping itself unique Its a tale were all familiar with being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial cruel world which Im sure was even more relevant to post WW Germany at the time filmed with a mix of overthetop melodrama megabudget setpieces and designs that confound the senses Add the appropriate music and youve got a classic fantasy A tremendous film to see two three a dozen times over though some of those too impatient for films without spoken words or by the operatic dramatic side of it all may become disappointed or frustrated,10
323,tt0017136,For many years the initially flopped and consequently butchered Metropolis Fritz Lang made in the mid twenties of the past century could be appreciated at least for its qualities as the indispensable sciencefiction trailblazer in motion picture history What was severely lacking from the plot however finally emerged on screen again after the famous Buenos Aires reel find which brought a quarter of what was missing from the film back from the dead With the new painstaking  restoration effort also came a grandiose symphony orchestra studio recording of the original Gottfried Huppertz score  and the results make movie buffs prone to be blown away and this time for realThe technical brilliance and visual lavishness of Fritz Langs oeuvre was always undisputed already at its time and only matched by fellow German Murnaus ingenious approaches on filmmaking Theres so much and dense imagery that generations of future filmmakers would draw from this newly emerging archetype Among the unforgettable scenes are the giant heart machine which turns into a moloch in one of the heros visions the Babel tower teeming with utopian life the enormous sets elevators and masses and masses of enslaved and rebellious people the staggering creation of the first robot all set against the dominant dichotomy between  literally  those living above and those dying below There are echoes of communism here of nazi ideology of the dangers and abysses of industrialization technology and there are also glimpses of humanity Not perfect in all its components the film nevertheless has everything pioneering in it  and more Fritz Lang while having some reservations himself referred to the picture as a signpost for new destinations and thats exactly what it became now that we can look at the great scifi pictures of the past century In them and through them Metropolis still lives and once we revisit the original again we might yet be surprised that it miraculously still points ahead,10
324,tt0017925,Probably Buster Keatons best film and oddly enough its not even a straightforward comedy  its actually an action film with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure  `The General which is set during the Civil War is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray Buster Keaton of course who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army    and is turned down because the army feels hed be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier  However through a series of misunderstandings both Johnnys family and his girl think hes a coward and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier  Months pass and Johnny sad and alone is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North  Johnnys efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girls love  become an unbelievably funny and actionpacked series of events as Johnny tries to go from being a sadsack buffoon to being a heroIf you havent watched many silent films they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive as hes fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye  While funny Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well  His timing whether for a joke or for a tender moment is absolutely impeccableWhats also great about `The General is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldnt be made today  No amount of insurance would cover it  Keaton does all his own stunts and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General with a bike he sits on a moving cattlecatcher knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own  All these stunts are fantastic but its scary to think that any one of these probably couldve killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong  ,9
325,tt0017925,Buster Keaton once said that if he hadnt been a comedian he might have been a civil engineer He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics Its no wonder he adored trains the most elegant of machines and brought them into his movies whenever he could When one of Keatons former gagwriters loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this page of history to life His first certainty was that the production had to be so authentic it hurts He even insisted on using historically accurate narrowgauge railroad tracks which he found along with appropriate landscapes near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove OregonMost importantly the area had stretches of parallel tracks which allowed scenes of Buster on his trainagilely scrambling over the cars balancing on the roof to scan the horizon chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind himto be filmed from another train running alongside Buster his train and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Busters hair while smoky pinecovered hills rise and fall around him These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures and they put to shame all later backprojection and process shots models and computergenerated effects The quality of Keatons filmmaking is simplypun intendedunparalleled Every shot in The General is clean fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times The film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional just like the grave masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniformsThe Generals narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look Like a train it stays on track never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline Adapting the historical incident Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train Johnnie Gray rather than one of the raiders As he saw immediately The General is one long chase or rather two chases structured like the flight of a boomerang First Johnnie on a borrowed train the Texas chases his own stolen train the General He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines pursued by the raiders in the Texas who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high commandThe General is not Keatons funniest film but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs A number of the gags like the boxcar that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks have a long buildup for a relatively modest payoff But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings The cannon attached to the back of Busters train goes off just as the train starts around a curve so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders train coming out of the curve Riding on the cowcatcher Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his trains wheels so lost in thought he doesnt notice when the train starts to move carrying him up and down in gentle arcs stillness in motionI agree with author Jim Kline who describes The General as Keatons most personal film the one that best captures his unique vision spirit and personality In many of his films Buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero But his competent ingenious and athletic character in The General who is also modest tireless and underestimated comes much closer to his real nature There is a shot in The General of Busters eye isolated on screen framed by a hole in a white tablecloth that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertovs kinoglaz the cameraeye Keaton melds with his camera; theres no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies They have the same silence the same strictness the same strange blend of gravity and humorThe General might be the most serious comedy every made but its not a tragicomedy That as in Chaplins blending of pathos and low humor was something people took to immediately But no one knew what to make of The General Original reviews accused the film of being dull pretentious unoriginal and unfunny Even today people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing The General is challenging because it doesnt flaunt its virtues; like Keatons concise and economical performance it holds a great deal in reserve Take the movies most famous shot of a train crashing through a burning bridge for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film he doesnt dwell on it or hype it Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience never manipulates never overplays He doesnt show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents nor does he play for sympathy Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold But for those who can see the expressiveness of Busters socalled stone face who get his peculiar dry humor who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated Buster Keaton always has more than hes showing; you can see it in his eyes,10
326,tt0017925,It is generally or should I pun and say General Lee? said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keatons career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past but getting the correct rolling stock costumes weapons and props to make it look correct And it worked so well that Keaton never really could despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR outdo it In fact the closest thing to his best sound film or film that he influenced that was a sound film was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE where he returned to a Civil War themeTHE GENERAL as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE is based on the Andrews Raiders stealing of the Confederate locomotive The General and an attached train which was used to damage tracks and bridges The raid in February  was from northern Georgia into Tennesee It only lasted  miles as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial Others went to southern prisoner of war camps The effect of the incident far outstripped its military success The damage after all could be repaired But like Jimmy Doolittles Raid over Tokyo in April  it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky/Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhileDespite it being a brief incident of the war the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south When Lesney did it famous series of Models of Yesteryear the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was The GeneralThe story however was ultimately a downer But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period First he changes the viewers perspective  it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men but on the Confederates Secondly he builds up the story of Johnny Gray a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier Because Keatons family and girl friend Marion Mack see he is not enlisted they believe he turned cowardJohnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake the General from the raiders and the film has actually two chases in it  first Andrews and his men stealing the train and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking itAlong the way are many comic classic moments such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train or when at a moment of dejection Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase and finding Marion Mack there helping him are wonderful  especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired she throws away the ugly little ones Keatons reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful momentThe classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river and the burning of the railroad bridge with its destruction of a second locomotive It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history By the way the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest He was Mike Turkey Strut Donlin a frequent member and starring player of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the th Century Donlin who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases left baseball to become a film actor he had worked a bit in vaudeville Keaton was a sports fan and showed this in his film COLLEGE where he shows his abilities in several sports and hired Donlin This was the latters most famous performance  look at his reaction to the collapseIt must be regarded as Keatons finest film and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures,10
327,tt0017925,No one will top Keaton for physical risk and risk is what deep film experiences are all about This might be classed as a comedy but for me it touches deeply enough Its about a man who needs to prove himself by taking risks and being true And its by a man who takes even greater risks and is more true True to the spirit of the social compact here displayed as the chummy southHes always done stunts that amaze Many of his other films have things in them that if the timing were only a little off hed be seriously injured or die But this takes the cake Its almost as if he started with the idea that hed have three locos to play with and had a year to think up stunts And the stunts are so physical! And so dangerous And so so very effective His trademark is the deadpan face placed as a sort of innocent cluelessness Its particularly funny when you see the physical movements and you know that  they take incredible preparation and timing to pull off and  the fellow you see that looks so puzzled by the reality you see is the guy that devised and directed those stuntsTeds Evaluation   of  Worth watching,0
328,tt0017925,I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number # on the  version of AFIs Top  Movies of all time list It didnt make the cut at all for the original compilation in  so even before seeing the picture I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion I usually line up with the majority in most cases but I have to admit I dont quite get it with this picture I found it entertaining enough on occasion but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way its heralded on the DVD sleeve I dont think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy so right there my expectations were greatly reduced Keatons somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition dont help On the flip side I wouldnt have expected slapstick to move the story along either so at least I wasnt disappointed in that regardWhat I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity When Johnnie Gray Keaton dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army and pondered his situation while sitting on the trains connecting rod the resulting visual was pure genius The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnies thoughtful reverie and was one of the highlights of the picture for meThe other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge For starters I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb  unbelievableOh yes and I cant forget the sequence where Keatons marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a preCGI world its difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own For that Keaton deserves accoladesIn between all this clever film making however I just wasnt inspired The central plot element doesnt hold up for me  if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer why wasnt he simply told the reason why One could argue that then you wouldnt have a picture but for me it left the story on a shaky footing If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier the picture might have taken a different approach but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero Maybe Im second guessing a master but thats what I come away withConclusion  if this movie didnt make AFIs Top  Film List in  I dont understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top  At the same time Chaplins City Lights in my estimation a superior silent film fell OFF the list while The Gold Rush moved up a few notches I may not be a professional but I know what I like and this one just didnt do it for me,7
329,tt0017925,Buster Keatons The General about a man and his engine puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen From major comic situations to throwaway gags The General always knows what to doThe story begins in leisurely fashion A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray Keaton has two loves in his life his engine and his girlrespectively The General and Annabelle Lee Marion Mack Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle followed by two engineerworshipping boys and unknown to him Annabelle Lee herself He and his entourage arrive at the door; Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs slicks back his hair and gently taps the door with the door knocker Then he turns to notice Annabelle Keatons understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness Any other comedian would have done an explosive doubletakeNow Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor but the boys are there too Johnnie stands up puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave The heroworshippers are ready to follow but Johnnie lets them out first then closes the door on them This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pantsNow the two are alone Annabelles father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon the War Between the States has begun Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist then turns expectantly to Johnnie who cocks his head like a confused puppy She asks Arent you going to enlist? Realization hits him and he leaps off the seat Before he can run out the door Annabelle kisses him This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porchJohnnie races to the general store which is now a makeshift recruitment office Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation but the man rejects him Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer Later Annabelle believes that Johnnie didnt even try to enlist She refuses to speak to him again until hes in uniform What follows is a classic moment Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine Hes so miserable that he doesnt notice when he starts moving up and down until just before the train enters a tunnelTime passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General When nearly everyone is off the train having dinner the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine Annabelle a passenger herself was still on board She is now their prisonerBut Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen possibly by deserters He pursues the engine by taking another The Texas Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas but the Unionists think theyre outnumbered and continue to run What follows is the true joy of the movie two long chases separated by an important plot twist Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop actionI love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas At one point the car which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track reappears in front of the baffled engineer only to disappear later just as mysteriously We see the logical circumstances that lead to the cars seeming magic act and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied preventing him from seeing what we seeComic logic is important to The General In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable In a throwaway gag Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for itWe move to the second chase where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle LeeMarion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was She has hilarious moments The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire She takes a small stick and daintily puts it in Johnnie sarcastically hands her a sliver and she puts that in too Then in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping Johnnie grabs her and halfthrottles her before kissing her insteadThe final section most of it a battle scene includes the shot where The Texas begins to cross a burning bridge only to crash into the river Owing to Keatons disdain of fakery one of several reasons his works seem modern he did not use a model but a real train on a real burning bridge The crash cost $reportedly making it the single most expensive shot ever in a silent filmA worthy closing gag was too taxing even for Keatons ingenuity Johnnies dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers His remedy is only mildly funny Is anyone complaining? The General is a work of art and a work of genius,0
330,tt0017925,This film flopped when it was released in late  for several reasons First its premiere was delayed because Flesh and the Devil was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks Second people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian not Buster the filmmaker and director which is more of the role he played here The film was funny but it was not gag after gag like so many of Keatons other films Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South A title card declares he has two loves  his girl and his engine when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession His girlfriend misunderstands thinks him a coward and says she wont speak to him again until he is in uniformMeanwhile the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Busters train Unknown to Buster his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train still without the knowledge of his girls captivity by the Union armyForgotten with the arrival of sound the film revived  often cut up from its original length  in the s because Buster didnt preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today often with poor video and hideous musical accompanimentToday The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too SHERLOCK JR is clever OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious The General is both of these things Its story driven races to a climax and is fueled by cute clever inventive gagsBuster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in A Southern Yankee,9
331,tt0017925,One of the great masterpieces of cinema Buster Keatons The General combines inventive humor with terrific action and fine melodrama all beautifully and carefully planned and photographed  It is filled with subtle and wonderful details that make it well worth devoting your full attention to watching  As an extra bonus it offers a fascinating look at the Civil War era with many realistic details inspired by a historical incidentAfter a short opening sequence the movie divides nicely into two halves Johnny Keaton is a railway engineer turned down in his attempts to enlist in the Confederate Army and subsequently rejected by his girl  Continuing with the railroad one day his locomotive is stolen by Union spies who also kidnap his girl  Johnny first chases the engine into Union territory to recapture it and then is himself chased by the Northern Army as he attempts to return home  Both chases are filled with excitement and manic fun with some breathtaking stunts by Keaton thrown in  It all leads up to a dramatic and memorable climax that includes many ironic and suggestive touchesKeaton is at his best with the story offering him a perfect showcase for his many talents  His slapstick and acrobatic skills are given free rein and his characters stoic perseverance is a fine complement to the frantic actionThis belongs near the top of any list of great films a classic worth watching and rewatching,0
332,tt0017925,I havent had so much fun watching a movie for a long time The General is a silent comedy mostly slapstick about Johnny Gray a train engineer with two loves his engine and Annabelle Lee Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer Things are then sped up a year where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan As it so happens they steal Johnnys engine a big mistakeBuster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies but of course less old He is often ignorant of what is going on around him leading to plenty of laughs This also makes him a very charismatic characterThere are countless train related jokes The first one comes right at the beginning when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman in a line much like a train The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment The finale is explosiveThe General was a lot of fun to watch It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies and had plenty of substance on top of that This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever After my first viewing it instantly became one of my favorites It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies,10
333,tt0017925,THE GENERAL represents the greatest achievement screen comedy ever accomplished From the brilliant gag construction to the sheer excellence of the filmmaking technique THE GENERAL is a hilarious and amazing journey into comedy Written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman Keaton brings brilliant gags into the story The film begins when Keaton is told he is of no use to the South as a soldier but as a train engineer However his girlfriend refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform After the war has started the girl is kidnapped by some Union raiders on Keatons train and so begins the greatest and funniest chase ever filmed For the next  minutes the viewer is in Keatons world His gags routines and amazing slapstick serve to make this the greatest screen comedy ever filmedMatt age ,0
334,tt0017925,Ive seen one other silent movie in my life but it was Mel Brookss The Silent Movie so I dont know if it really counts I really enjoyed The General overall more than I thought I would as someone who was born after The GodfatherThe main thing that surprised me was the fact that I couldnt look down to write very many notes; any time I took my eyes off the screen I ran a serious risk of missing something It seems to me that the film even though it was long or seemed so it was very dense in terms of action I imagine that since the movie has no dialogue the filmmakers must make up for it by making it as visually interesting and entertaining as possible I am accustomed to more modern movies with snappy dialogue and special effects and suchmovies in which you can look down at your popcorn or kiss your date and not miss too much because you can hear pretty much whats happening This was a nice change for meObviously Ive never seen a Buster Keaton film and Im not even sure if Id heard of him before this class But I can see why he is so appealing in his films I loved his facial expressions particularly the stoicbutcrestfallen look in his eyes on the train when something else goes wrong He also has great control of his body as we discussed in class and a fine sense of comic timingI found the film surprisingly funny Many modern films that I think are funny eg Austin Powers Toy Story American Beauty rely largely on witty or outrageous dialogue for their humor As a silent film The General must rely mainly on images for its humorthe slapstick images of Johnnie falling over constantly the unusual image of Johnnie riding up and down on the crossbar between the train wheels the stereotype exploitation in the scene when the girl sweeps out the locomotive Im sure that some of the things that I considered amusing might not have been considered funny by the original audience such as the recordscratch lightning bolts,0
335,tt0017925, Georgia USA The American Civil War is in its second year and Johnnie Gray is barred from enlisting He is a train engineer and the Confederate Army feel he is more valuable to the Southern cause in his current role than in the army This frustrates Johnnie and has estranged him from his sweetheart Annabelle who views him as a coward Then his beloved engine The General is stolen by Union spies and is heading for Union lines Moreover Annabelle is on board Johnnie sets off after the two loves of his lifeGreat comedy from the silent era directed and starring one of the greatest comedy directors and actors of that era Buster Keaton This is a rollicking adventure complete with wonderfully thoughtout and performed physical comedy and other sight gags Some very clever use of the plot to generate the comedyThe plot itself isnt overly profound but crams in a lot of action and adventure plus some romanceVery entertaining,8
336,tt0017925,THE GENERAL When one watches for the first time the General great things happen laughter relief a neverending smileand that old sniff of old good cinema I must admit not many films out there give the pleasure this one has It is like everything just falls right into place Overall the movie is a perfect account of all the things that make comedy great Simplicity good and twisted plot a sense of the unexpected becoming more and more realDo you feel me dont you? It has been attributed to Chalie Chaplin the following sentence to make a comedy film you only need three things a park a woman and a police officer We can safely say The General stands up to it Well there is no park in The General although the landscape is used wisely but theres a woman As for the police officerwell not exactly What we do have in the film are soldiers Im afraid of telling you the plot of the story because I dont want to spoil anything I reckon itd be better if you find it out for yourselves Well lets just say that Buster Keaton plays the main character an engineer whose beloved locomotive has been stolen by Union spies From that point on he does everything in his power to get it back Theres nothing more for me to say butEnjoy yourselves!!,8
337,tt0017925,To watch The General is to be both awed and amused at what takes place The consensus view is correct This is an amazing movieYou know whats more amazing? Despite what most critics say Buster Keaton made funnier better films than thisKeaton a lifelong railroad buff is engineer Johnny Gray captain of The General a locomotive which carries passengers and freight across the American South When the Civil War breaks out he tries to enlist and thus please his girl Annabelle Lee Marion Mack but the authorities deem him more useful running trains When Union spies seize the General with an idea of using it to burn bridges and disrupt the Confederate supply line its up to Gray to save the dayNew York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall reviewed The General back in  and expressed disappointment This is by no means so good as Mr Keatons previous efforts he wrote People cite Halls review as a classic example of whatdocriticsknow but the more I read the more I agreed with him The fun is not exactly plentiful he wrote noting Keaton here was too much the acrobat too little the clownWhen I watched The General I felt disappointment too Like Halls it wasnt total; its exciting and inventive and boasts some of the finest screen compositions Ive ever seen The technical expertise on display is astounding Its just that the overall experience left me a bit flatFirst you have what Roger Ebert liked to call the idiot plot Gray tries to enlist and is rejected by the army because hes too valuable as a train engineer Annabelle apparently never learns this for she rejects him as a coward I dont want you to speak to me again until youre in uniform she huffsEither hes an idiot for not explaining the truth of the matter or shes an idiot for preferring her lover be cannon fodder than a real asset to their cause Anyway Buster does manage to make this play later on When he finally speaks to her he is in uniform an enemy uniformThe other main issue involves what Lincoln called the slows A lot of the story is literally trainwatching Buster does some brave amazing stuntwork and throws in some clever gags later joined by Mack whos no Sibil Seely but still quite game but its basically a lot of watching trains go by The craft here is in the precision of the camerawork and the splitsecond timing not so much the comedy In fact except for Buster himself everyone plays it completely straight probably because this is real history being presented Compared to other Keaton comedies it feels a bit straitjacketed by thatThe General is still a solid thrill comedy with some amusing one liners If you lose this war dont blame me Johnny yells after being rejected and brilliant sight gags like the fussy Annabelles rejection of unattractive firewood while Buster struggles to stoke the engineTo me thats enough for The General to be another good reason for loving Buster Keaton I just cant understand it being the preeminent reason Maybe critics cant really love a comedy for just making you laugh and laugh Im just glad Keaton made other movies at least as brilliant as The General and funnier too,7
338,tt0017925,Buster Keaton s performance in The General was purely enjoyable The story takes place during the civil war on centers on Johnnie Gray Keaton a train operator in the South Johnnie is not accepted for service in the confederate army because of his value on the railroad and suffers the shame of being home while the other men are fighting a war When his beloved engine is hijacked by Union soldiers the unpredictable story goes into overdrive Johnnies adventure includes train chases rescuing the love of his life a daring escape and a climactic battle This film has a distinct action/adventure aspect but at its core it is a brilliant comedy/drama Keatons performance is superb He has the ability to effortlessly change your mood and the mood of the film with his facial expressions and physical comedy Keatons character seems to make endless mistakes that work for the best and good decisions in dangerous situations It is easy to imagine Keaton as a major influence for a future comedians and I personally felt like I was watching the Mel Brooks of a previous generation The General was a fun film to watch with a true star Buster Keaton turning in a timeless heartfelt performance,7
339,tt0017925,When watching The General  the similarities between Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin are almost unmistakable The story was original and humorous and the performance by Buster Keaton was pleasing What I didnt like was the fact that the protagonist still was pursuing the girl who was so quick to leave him when she thought he wasnt brave and then ends up staying with her at the end He is too good for her I thought the stunt where the bridge gives out and the train falls was very well done and must have cost a fortune There were scenes where I found myself laughing out loud and scenes where I was bored So unfortunately the film doesnt do a great job at keeping the viewer glued to the screen but overall it was enjoyable,7
340,tt0017925,I feel the The General is a great silent film because even though the story line is relatively complicated the way in which each character played their part and the way it was filmed made it easy to follow I am fairly new to the silent film experience and when I saw that this movie was partially a comedy I was expecting something more along the lines of Charlie Chaplin however I was pleasantly surprised at Buster Keatons more subtle comedic style I felt that the film was well shot shot considering the technology of the day I was actually shocked during the scene where the Rock River Bridge collapsed under The Texas Knowing full well it was not special effects I couldnt believe the producers would spare the expense of destroying a locomotive and an entire bridge This movie is sure to be one of my favorite silent films,7
341,tt0017925,Buster Keaton always amazes me He was truly one of the most hilarious deadpan screen clowns of early cinema And The General even clocking in at around three hours is surprisingly watchable based on his physical performance aloneGranted I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything thats unnecessary but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments There are multiple points in the General a story about a Southern engineer that has to rescue his beloved from the clutches of the North in the Civil War where Keatons character Johnnie Gray has to stop his train jump out and remove something from the tracks which in itself can be quite boring but the way that Keaton injects physical comedy into those moments keeps me entertainedAnd its a marvel how so many realistic yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with Its nothing fantastic like some of his other films but its still funny And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversitybut he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and its just enough to know that he is frightened but that the rest of him doesnt react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny Whether hes pratfalling due to surprise or erroneously succeeding at something hes unskilled in and being shocked by it that response of his is winningBut the General does show its age a little It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesnt get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context I wouldnt dare cut those moments out of this film even if I could reedit it because the space always had something going on but at the same time this film if made today would be cut to oneandahalf or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly The plot and story are simple but exist more than to just help the comedy move alongexcept at the end when the first story was accomplished Then we move into a second extraneous but still amusing story regarding a battle between the North and the South that couldve been excised and still having a decent though simple storyI didnt really love the score that the DVD company attached to it which is a number of classical pieces end on end I think a new commissioned soundtrack wouldve better matched the piece but I guess we get what we get And on the plus side you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of itIs it perfect? No But despite the age it shows it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinemas greatest physical comedians If you want to spend three hours with a silent clown this is not a bad way to go /,8
342,tt0017925,Have a lot of appreciation for comedy especially the witty and sophisticated kinds and there are a good deal of classic comedies that go for the broad approach too Am significantly less keen though on the vulgar puerile style of humour that is seen quite a lot today the worst of it veering on the offensive There are many instances of silent films/comedies seen with Charlie Chaplin prime Laurel and Hardy and with Buster KeatonKeaton is seen as one of the greats by many but for some reason doesnt seem to be quite as well known even with a just as good reputation critically as Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy who transitioned better into sound maybe when at his best in the s an extraordinary period with a deservedly lauded reputation he was every bit as great as funny and as likeable His daring physical comedy and stoic deadpan expressions were unique and ahead of its time at the time and still amaze and are distinct now plus he was a bigger risktaker with bolder material and immense courage that most wish they could have Which perhaps hasnt been more apparent than in this film The General often considered one of his best and most important films or even his masterpiece though with other just as worthy efforts it has been debated and justifiably so This paragraph is very subjective of course and probably wont be agreed with but that is just my respectful stanceThe General to this day still looks great and remarkably lavish something of a technical achievement in its day It also should be used as an example of how to have effects that still look good and like a lot of effort and care went into them and also use them properly rather than overusing and abusing them to gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now The locomotive features heavily here and to ingenious and quite imaginative effect The direction keeps the momentum going with ease and balances all The Generals elements every bit as adeptlyWhen it comes to the humour which is very physical it is never less than very funny and is timed inventively throughout no corniness at all and it gels very well But The General is much more than just a comedy and one can say that its not really one It has other elements too and executes them even better actually especially the action the scope dexterity and boldness of it and especially those stunts absolutely jawdropping and truly exciting to watch It is also an example of how to have action that thrills while being easy on the eyes coherent and not being too noisy or busy something to learn fromAlso here is a tender understated quality that is very surprising and the romantic element is genuinely charming without being sappy The film also has a story thats easy to follow and at the same time is logical and interesting indicating a film with brains as well as soul that treats the viewer with respect rather than getting irritated by credibility straining and logic lapses Keaton is superb here not only is his comic timing on point but he provides a character thats endearing and worth rooting for His physicality and how he copes with the stunts is aweinspiring and he is one of not many to make deadpan interesting and entertaining because he still makes it very expressive and nuanced The rest of the cast are easy to overlook but are just as strong even if with not as much to do or with material that sticks in the mind as muchOverall brilliant and a Buster Keaton essential / Bethany Cox,10
343,tt0017925,There are some truly wonderful scenes in this film which is full of adventure comedy and some pretty impressive stuntwork on moving trains by Buster Keaton and the other actors The premise is that Keaton a train conductor has volunteered to fight for the South at the outset of the Civil War but been turned down When his train is stolen by Union soldiers he immediately gives chase on foot then a handcar briefly a bicycle and then finally another train not knowing quite yet that his girlfriend Marion Mack was inadvertently also kidnappedIn one of the memorable early scenes Keaton is sitting on the connecting rod of the locomotive lost in thought when it starts up bobbing him up and down In another he packs a cannon on his train with a massive charge and as its angle slowly descends before firing it appears hes going to blow himself up until his train at the last minute hits a curve and he nearly hits his intended target Its just wonderful There is also of course the scene with a Union train going out onto a burning bridge which then collapses one of the most iconic and expensive scenes of the eraIn addition to those big moments there are also innumerable little things Keaton does which highlight his genius He is just so lovable and talented He uses one of the large railroad ties intended to derail him to knock another off the track as his train is moving When hes hiding under a table surrounded by Union officers hes subtly kicked and jostled in funny ways As he makes his escape with Mack he stuffs her into a large sack that he had emptied of shoes only to lose his own shoe in the process and struggle to locate it I also thought I saw bits of Woody Allen in the scene where he urges her to be quiet only to knock things over and make noise himselfAmbitious aweinspiring influential clever and still funny + years later Is it the best ever? I dont know I liked The Cameraman  even more but still – damn good,9
344,tt0017925,Buster Keaton is Johnnie Gray a southerner who wants to fight for the cause but gets rejected because he could be of more use as an engineer than as a soldier Unfortunately hes not told why he was turned down and his gal just assumes that hes a coward Not so because when a Yankee scallywag steals his beloved steam engine the titular The General Johnnie heads north to recover the engine and through a series of misadventures becomes a hero of the Confederacy and rescues Annabelle Lee Glorious sight gags abound as Old Stone Face deals with errant cannon loose sword blades uncooperative firewood inexplicable soakings and a lessthanhelpful rescuee not to mention an entire army of bluebellies Great fun from another era and a wonderful example of the silent genre,8
345,tt0017925,Buster Keaton plays the lead in this silent era masterpiece that takes its inspiration from the Great Locomotive Chase which in turn was a real event during the American Civil War in which a train was stolen by the North and sped over the lines in preparation for the coming offenseThe General has some definitive upsides working in its favour Buster Keaton is an amazingly versatile performer able to go from clownish jokester to a saddened victim of war and poor circumstances in a heartbeat The film is also really ambitious in scope Keaton performs all of his stunts most of them hairraisingly dangerous and completely unimaginable nowadays Plus very little money is spared and the film famously has some of the most expensive set pieces and stunts of the silent eraThe plot of the film is also a lot more cohesive than say in the films made by Charlie Chaplin in the same decade Chaplins films usually contain segments that have little to do with anything except the need for funny situations The General is also a comedy but with a clear clean story arcOn the other hand I didnt find the humour or the characters as captivating Theyre okay but in this regard the decades of cultural development between the film and yours truly work against the film I just didnt find the slapstick all that funnyStill The General is a great watch for all interested in early cinema or really involved physical humour,0
346,tt0017925,The General is one of the great films and treasures of the silent era Its among the best movies of the talented comedy actor Buster Keaton In this film Keaton shows the athletic ability and courage that made him one of the best of the early comedians who performed their own stunts His physical antics on and off his train The General support his title as king of comedy stunts All the silent era comedy actors seemed to have lots of energy And many had daring courage and even madness at times Those were the actors who did all or most of their own stunts While there were some stunt men around in the early s it wasnt until the last of the silent years and dawn of sound pictures that stuntmen were a regular part of the cast of films that required any amount of derringdo And while a small number of actors today will still do some of their own stunts nothing can compare to the actors of old who performed their own highrisk and dangerous stunts – and sometimes those for other actors The five best early actors at doing stunts were Buster Keaton Douglas Fairbanks Sr Harold Lloyd Tom Mix and Yakima Canutt The latter two specialized in Westerns and besides acting and doing stunt work Mix and Canutt regularly rode and performed in the rodeo circuit Lloyd was versatile in his venues but excelled at high stunts on buildings and sometimes with wild animals Fairbanks excelled in swashbuckler stunts sliding down the sails of ships swinging from anything hanging aloft and jumping with the help of trampolines into windows Keaton was even more versatile As a child actor in vaudeville Keaton learned how to fall to avoid injury He called his technique soft falls or landings But even with his training and practice his film roles with derringdo often left him bruised at the least At other times he had suffered injuries from slight to serious Still he had become known for his physical resiliency During the filming of The General in  Keaton was knocked unconscious by canon fire He suffered a broken ankle while filming the  short The Electric House And he broke his neck during the  shooting of Sherlock Jr but didnt know it until years later This movie has an interesting plot set during the US Civil War It opens with a scene and script that reads The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marietta Georgia in the spring of  The train seems to be traveling about  miles per hour But the film is almost entirely about action and the comedy in the action involving the train There is an element of romance The cast all are very good The photography is superb Much of the action with trains is filmed in Westcentral Oregon from Eugene to Cottage Grove Theres no information about sound at all so I assume the music we hear with the film is soundtrack that was added for modern viewing It probably is meant to replicate the piano accompaniment that was usual with silent films in theaters of the day This is one instance when I think the piano playing would have been better The music seems to go overboard at times This is one of the early great films from the silent era that showcase the talent and early mastery of moviemaking skills Its a fun movie with strong visuals that even a modern family of all ages should enjoy,10
347,tt0017925,Johnnie Gray a train engineer tries to enlist in the Confederate Army to impress his girlfriend Unfortunately he is rejected because his role as engineer is deemed more important Lucky for Gray he is given the opportunity to prove himself when a band of Union soldiers in disguise hijack a trainAt the time of this films release it was a flop and considered to be not very funny Since then it has gone on to be declared one of the greatest films of all time Funny how that works I would tend to agree that it isnt really very funny but it is a great film for a variety of reasonsBuster Keaton was an amazing actor and director He was willing to put himself in dangerous situations for a laugh  he was his own stuntman right there when the train falls in the water really sitting on the side of a moving train and on the front of it he could have been killed And this was captured on film flawlesslyPersonally I enjoyed his Sherlock Jr better I thought the tricks were better and the action funnier It had a faster pace too that kept me hooked enough to watch it a few times The General was not boring but as a silent film it could have done more to grab the audience and Im not sure that it did,7
348,tt0021749,If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend as others have pointed to in the past City Lights is the one Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies like Modern Times and The Gold Rush City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest his bravest his most romantic and his most sympathetic Its tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters but its pulled off The film centers on three characters the Tramp the quintessential funny homeless man who blends into the crowd but gets caught in predicaments He helps a drunken businessman Myers a fine performance in his own right from suicide and becomes his on and off again friend that is when it suits him and doesnt notice his friends state The other person in the Tramps life is the Blind Flower Girl Virginia Cherrill one of the most absorbing beautiful and key female performances in silent film who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money which leads to a how else can I put it magical boxing match where its basically a  from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull Though there is no dialog the film achieves a timelessness its essentially a tale of two loners who find each other lose each other and find each other again the last scene widely discussed by critics for decades is moving if not tearinducing And its never ever boring once you get along with the Tramp you find the little things about him the reaction shots the little things he does after the usual big gag look to the ballroom scene for examples of this or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing Truth be told if this film makes you indifferent never watch Chaplin again But if you give yourself to the film you may find its one of the most charming from the era or perhaps any era,10
349,tt0021749,Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplins City Lights a masterpiece Its only  minutes long but they are among the best  minutes you could spend at the movies and the last five minutes are simply exquisite Keep your Kleenex box at arms length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says Yes I can see now the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanationChaplin was at his zenith in  when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story and the Little Tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade He had already made the classics The Gold Rush  and The Circus  starring his character so its obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time The advent of talkies didnt stop Chaplin from making this Comedy Romance in Pantomime as he subtitled it as he knew giving the Little Tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character What I particularly enjoyed in this film is how the Little Tramp fancies himself as a wellmannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down even going to prison for love It is this selfdelusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl played in an effectively plaintive manner by Virginia Cherrill Her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable Simply compare her to the screen test shown of Georgia Hale Chaplins leading lady in The Gold Rush and an obviously more experienced actress than Cherrill as Hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the Little Tramp is the wealthy gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sightOf course this would not be a Chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes  the rising and lowering of the street elevator the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers and was according to the footage included as a DVD extra inspired by an earlier Chaplin short The Champion from  Even a simple moment for example when the Little Tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment And special mention needs to go to Chaplins musical score where he beautifully interweaves José Padillas La Violetta as his love themeThe transfer to DVD is very good and the DVD set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality The Serge Bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film and the footage of Chaplin from a Vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the longforgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then The aforementioned Georgia Hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long The minute home movie of Chaplins trip to Bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise Regardless the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies Chaplins reputation as one of the worlds leading filmmakers,10
350,tt0021749,This is my favorite Chaplin film but I dont want that to diminish his other work either MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick and even the largelyneglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone Chaplin didnt make a bad movie and Im not even sure that CL is his best exactly But it IS my favorite if only for the endingThat ending has been the subject of much comment here I think its a masterpiece in a single scene Chaplins little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living breathing human being Its a monument to understated sentimentalityTo me the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid Yes the boxing scene is great and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful but its that ending that makes us all love this movie,0
351,tt0021749,Once again Chaplin plays his famous creation the beloved Tramp The noble Little Fellow meets and falls in love with a blind flower girl She assumes he is wealthy man and offers him a flower which he attentively accepts with his last penny One night by chance he rescues a drunken millionaire from drowning The rich gentleman becomes a generous friend when drunk but doesnt recognize the tramp when sober Chaplin takes the blind girl under his wing and takes flight with the millionaires money to cure her blindness City Lights engaged a true genius in a graceful and touching performance which arouses profound feelings and joy with great simplicity of style and tragic tale Each scene was the result of hardworking detail and planning,9
352,tt0021749,Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights and the results are spectacular The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights and even though Charlies performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant City Lights is so well made that it is one of the very few movies in which the obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked Yes you can clearly see the string holding Chaplin up in the sidesplittingly funny boxing scene but who cares? That is such classic slapstick that little things like that really dont matter Besides lets keep in mind that this movie was made seventy years ago Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk His friendship with the drunken rich guy is hilarious but it also makes a significant comment about the problems of alcohol This is truly a great film which should not be forgotten,10
353,tt0021749,Charlie Chaplins City Lights contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it  Although made very much in the oldfashioned silent film tradition much of it is timeless tooAfter a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning Charlies little tramp character makes two acquaintances  He meets a blind girl selling flowers who mistakes him for a rich man and the two become very fond of each other Then he meets a real millionaire who is drunk depressed and about to commit suicide  In a comic scene the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it making himself a devoted friendThe tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight and tries to think of some way he could help  His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades  his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny and one of Chaplins best comic pieces Meanwhile when his millionaire friend is drunk he dotes on the tramp but when sober he forgets who the tramp is leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for CharlieAll of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the bestremembered scenes in any film  City Lights shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master who without words can move his audience or make them laugh  Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once,0
354,tt0021749,Film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia  Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are  Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation  We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new  In City Lights and other silent works of film a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere  While watching the film I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story the sets the crew; the whole project  While this may not have been the complete reality it felt that way and thus made the film more enjoyable  In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional responseSince film is at its very core a visual medium I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium  I dont use the word basic here in a demeaning sense but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance  Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced but they were and are beautiful  The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic There is a warmth found in City Lights and other Chaplin films The Kid Modern Times that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today  Maybe its just that with simplicity comes honesty and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer,0
355,tt0021749,City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of filmmaking Chaplins last silent film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the mans wealth to make her fall in love with him The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesnt recognize the tramp anymore On top of this the flower girl has to pay  dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forthThe outcome of the movie is to almost all people known It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film The movie itself still is masterpiece more than  years after its release I personally rate this as Chaplins second best I have seen so far My favorite remains The Gold Rush Still this movie gets / stars from me,9
356,tt0021749,I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplins nicest most underappreciated silent movie gems Then I discovered it really wasnt underrated; its rated very high on most critics lists It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this onePart of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that Im a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one Its a romance between Charlies tramp character no name and a blind girl who also had no name in this film Virginia Cherill who played the blind woman and had a wholesome pretty face which I found very attractiveIm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as talkies were out in full force by  Chaplin was at his best in silent movies anyway and his comedy routines are legendary He gave me a lot of laughs in this film as always and I particularly laughed I love slapstick at the boxing scene Kudos too to Harry Myers as the eccentric millionaireTheres a lot of drama as well as humor in this minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sightComedy romance drama with suffering all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment Its hard to believe this movie was not up for one single Academy Award,9
357,tt0021749,CITY LIGHTS United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  l is a silent comedydrama released at the height of the sound era Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad Chaplin gambled with this production and made it pay off Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH  as the one movie he would most want to be remembered CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time practically places his other silent masterpiece THE CIRCUS  to oblivion CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama but in Chaplins case pathosSubtitled A comedy romance in pantomime the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city After the unveiling the crowd finds a little tramp Charlie Chaplin sleeping on the lap of one of the figures As he tries to climb down he encounters one problem after another This opening scene alone is priceless With such a great beginning Chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot The theme to CITY LIGHTS is remembered mainly about a tramps love for a blind girl However there is a subplot involving the tramps involvement with a millionaire drunk which by far takes up more time than the sentimental love story These two segments actually set the pattern First segment set in the afternoon finds Charlie walking down the street examining a nude statue in a shop being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing He encounters a beautiful blonde girl Virginia Cherrill selling flowers After she drops one of her flowers Charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it thus realizing shes blind Smitten by her beauty he picks it up and pays her for it Minutes later the slamming of a limousine door is heard with the girl believing the kind gentleman Charlie to be a millionaire Second segment set at night finds Charlie encountering a drunk Harry Myers trying to commit suicide by drowning himself Just as Charlie is about to save him he in turn falls into the river The drunk in gratitude for saving his life takes Charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn By morning the millionaire now sober fails to recognize or remember Charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion This running gag thats repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious but Chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges By day Charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when shes not at her usual corner selling flowers Finding that shes ill and being cared by her grandmother Florence Lee whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction Charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs ranging from streetcleaning to fighting in a boxing match Reading in a newspaper of a European doctor who restores sight for the blind Charlie gives the girl $ for an operation the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire who after sober accuses Charlie of robbing him has his arrested and serving jail time The climatic finish is truly the best thing Chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missedFeatured in the supporting cast are Henry Bergman Allan Garcia Albert Austin and Hank Mann While much has been discussed about Chaplins performance his costar Virginia Cherrill as the blind girl no name given should not go without mention Even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor Cary Grant her performance is excellent by all means Although its been said that future film star Jean Harlow  appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence she is visible in a surviving still photograph but no such scene appears in the finished product Unlike THE GOLD RUSH CITY LIGHTS had limited showings in revival houses in later years and was never allowed to be distributed to television Being first introduced to CITY LIGHTS at New York Citys revival movie house The Regency Theater formerly located on Broadway and th Street in  the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience There was one man probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film No doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else Watching CITY LIGHTS surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in After Chaplins death in December of  CITY LIGHTS along with his other silent features were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure but became readily available on video cassette at the time of Chaplins th birthday  In later years CITY LIGHTS was frequently revived on various cable channels ranging from Turner Network Television TNT in the early s American Movie Classics up to  and finally Turner Classic Movies The complete musical soundtrack that accompanies CITY LIGHTS happens to be the original score composed to perfection by Chaplin himself Much has been written and said about CITY LIGHTS over the years To learn more about the making difficulties and long term preparations to CITY LIGHTS either watch Kevin Blownlows  documentary Hollywood A Celebration of the American Silent Film as narrated by James Mason or Brownlows other documentaries dedicated entirely to Chaplins career including outtakes to CITY LIGHTS as well as scenes involving Virginia Cherrills temporary replacement Georgia Hale Chaplins costar in THE GOLD RUSH ****,10
358,tt0021749,Spoilers hereinFor me this film falls not into the category of favorite films Im a Marx brothers kind of guy but earns instead a place on a very short list of most important moviesThats because it has two features that I truly appreciateIt is as pure a vision of its creator as is possible Nearly all other films are engineered from prior work Not so with a small list of projects from Welles Kurosawa Eisenstein  and this one project of Chaplins They are wholly original springing from some nether worldBut the other element is the one that impresses the most This film is about itself about the art of visual narrative Chaplin was intelligent enough to know that what he was doing was new The issues are centered on what the audience `sees so while he struggles with what and how the audience sees he builds that into the fabric of the storyThe primary framing is about the blind girl who falls in love with him by `seeing him in her own way Then `sees him at the end in a different way The rich man recognizes the tramp when drunk but does not when he is not Nearly all the jokes indeed every element of the film is about this same dynamic the elevator which is not seen but then was the burglars the same the Tramp on the statue on the barrel Even seeing the cigar before the bum does Even us seeing the soap and the foreman notThe `seeing is carried over to `hearing with the politician and whistle jokes And then even further as Charlie turns his back on the new technology of giving us speech and instead `shows us something else he writes and conducts an amazing score instead This is truly amazing and one reason to take Mike Figgis seriouslyNo wonder Orson Welles considered this the most important film ever made But as to the best to watch? Because film is so derivative my own gold standard for the Tramp is Robert Downeys and to some extent Depps Comic timing is something that evolves and those men make a more effective Tramp for my modern ability to seeTrivia Chaplin found the `blind girl in a group of spectators at a fight and was struck with how her expressions reflected what she saw Shes pretty as well of course but certainly not the prettiest Chaplin knew See how Chaplin separately works in both the fight a performance and her reaction to his performance in the film,0
359,tt0021749,Waddling along with his cane and derby hat and that tiny mustache the little tramp Charles Chaplin is visually unlike any character in film history The tramp is kindhearted always dignified Hes a simple soul who in City Lights tries to help out a young blind woman well played by Virginia Cherrill This is a silent film of course but the tramps body language is his speechThe really noticeable feature of the tramp character is how he blends into everyday life Hes more or less ignored by many laughed at by others The girls grandmother never sees him at all And only when the millionaire is drunk does he see the tramp as a friend Curious  and deepThe tramp gets into his fair share of trouble but only through his bumbling efforts to help the girl The boxing match is a hoot and very well choreographed as are all the skits And what a beginning for a film with city leaders spouting gibberish probably as Chaplins dig at the talkies Then the way Chaplin makes his grand entrance  just terrific!Melancholy at times the films music really tugs at your heartstrings Maybe its sentimental and manipulative But given the abiding and Zenlike qualities of the tramp some sentimentality is quite appropriate And the music is choreographed totally in sync with the plot actionProduction design is sparse and at times drab That the film was made during the Great Depression is beyond obviousComedy here is simple and effective The main character expresses heart and humanity The little tramp is an unforgettable character And City Lights is a wonderful film,10
360,tt0021749,Chaplin was a unique presence in the history of the early cinema  Coming up through the ranks he gradually achieved a godlike stature being awarded total control of every facet of the productionNot only was he often the sole person who knew what the end product was to be as in The Kid but he was also allowed to elaborately improvise in the creative process  This often meant doing countless scores of retakes over days weeks and even months; holding up the cast and crew for days while he brooded over just what to do next; and even in the case of The Gold Rush cancelling expensive weeks of location shooting and returning to the studio to start all over againHe cleverly duped chief studio and bank chiefs into somehow going along with his freewheeling and gross inclinations thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hitandmiss schemes and trialanderror madnessIn other words Chaplin used the entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush with which he toyed at his pleasure to create his personal canvases  Fortunately he was a genius and at the right place in time to be allowed to get away with such unprecedented extravagenceIt was a young and growing industry when Chaplin began emerging and there were no set rules  People were still trying to figure out just what could be done with the medium  and Chaplin helped to establish its early parametersHe was certainly and autocrat yet that doesnt really matter when it comes to film works  Its the product that counts  In the case of City Lights all the bloodsweatandtears that it took to achieve the finished product was more than worth the effort  Now that all the frustration anger and outrage associated with the behindthescenes unfoldment of this highly troubled production are well in the past what remains is a genuinely moving film classic,10
361,tt0021749,The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one The first fulllength talkies were released in  By  theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business By  silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism But in  a new silent picture was released that far from being an embarrassing failure became the fourthhighest grossing picture of the year being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy The picture was City Lights and its producer writer director editor composer and star was Mr Charlie ChaplinChaplin was of course primarily a comedian and his humour was of broad appeal but audiences of the time were not exactly starved of easy comedy The Marx Brothers were making great strides on the verbal quipping front and the everpopular Laurel and Hardy had made a successful transition to sound What makes Charlie stand out and what gave him a level of accessibility that allowed him to continue with his slapstick antics well into the sound era is his equal devotion to story which allowed him a scope for social commentary empathetic characterisation and deep poignancy Of all Chaplins silent pictures City Lights is probably his least memorable in the funny stakes The number of classic gags here is fairly small Not since The Kid a decade earlier has Chaplin given story so much precedence City Lights is riddled with coincidence and plot contrivance but its a tale of such beauty and sincerity that this does not matter Within this story the comedy becomes functional often serving to puncture a schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone Ironically it is the occasional forays into slapstick that help keep City Lights realAs if to snub the talkie City Lights is a remarkable achievement in complex visual narrative even only occasionally relying upon title cards and then often only as an embellishment to the more comedydriven moments Most plot points and character traits are implied rather than stated which gives the picture a continual smoothness – another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad to see the back of the intrusive title card Out of necessity Chaplins technical approach is more overt than his usual He often cuts to a closeup to give us a necessary reaction and there are even some whippans in the scene where he and the flower girl first meet but all of this is in keeping with the rhythm and tone of the picture Those whip pans after all reflect an abrupt emotional moment and are in no way a blatant or showy manoeuvreBut what really makes City Lights work what makes it connect is the man himself on the screen Those additional closeups once a rarity for a man who acted mainly with his body now show off a capability for intense facial acting An older more meditative Chaplin may have been keeping the traditions of silent cinema alive but his own career trajectory was entering new ground where emotional expression was increasingly intimate and personal The result is profoundly moving,10
362,tt0021749,City Lights is a different film from what I am used to seeing I have not watched a Silent film or pantomime in a few years I really enjoyed the story that Charles Chaplin helped to create and produce for our enjoyment The plot seems to be commonly used now with a boy falling in love and trying to win the girls love in return In City Lights there are a few twists to the plot The girl is blind and poor the TrampChaplinis poor in love and wants to help the blind girl The Millionaire can help the tramp out by giving him money but he is an onagain offagain friend depending on whether or not he is drunkBeing that this is a silent film there is more importance on the use of props and the acting of the character Since in a silent film they cant tell us how they are feeling it is important that we can understand feelings through action This may be through facial expressions body language dress eye contact kinds of touch or the use of written statements like title cards in a silent film A prop that stood out to me was the use of flowers From the flower girl selling her flowers to how Chaplin was always holding or smelling one of the flowers from his special girl the use of flowers helped show the emotions and feelings of the two characters It symbolized the affection he had for her because like the flowers she couldnt see she couldnt see the true him or his true affections Another prop that was used was money From the millionaires point of view money was really of no matter He threw a party just because he had been reunited with his friend he went out to the dance club and when Chaplin needed money in order to help the flower girl pay for rent and surgery he was willing to give him one thousand dollars To the millionaire this money is nothing but to Chaplin and the flower girl this is a showing forth of love and charity When the movie was made in the s many people were poor and hopeless but the portrayal of Chaplin as a poor but happy and hopeful man might have given hope to others who watched this movie during the Depression In the film I noticed the use of a repetition or rather a parallelism as was read in the Film Art book dealing with The Wizard of Oz They show shots one way in Kansas and then reverse the shot in Oz as I saw in City Lights In City Lights parallelism is done with sight not necessarily with eyes but with the mind We see the reverse where the poor blind girl sees Chaplin as a millionaire and then at the end she sees him as the tramp he is with her new eyesight The true reverse is emphasized because she is now working in a shop and making money The two characters are somehow always at perceived opposite ends of the social class spectrum yet he still has a desire for her to be happy because of his love Another reverse is the happy friendly drunk millionaire who sees Chaplin as his friend and hero for stopping him from committing suicide However when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him throws him out and even has him arrestedIn a way this film is different then what our generation might be used to but by watching these classics we can better learn where the movies we love today came from and gain a better appreciation for the art of film,7
363,tt0021749,The tramp tries to nurture and help a blind flower girl regain sight despite scant resources and the prejudices and graft of the big city Although the physical gags lack the largescale invention of the factory scenes in Modern Times and the criticism of the wealthy doesnt transcend an admittedly witty recurring jokethe aristocrat friend can only demonstrate compassion and friendliness in an inebriated state; hes always inviting the tramp in only to incredulously throw him out the next sober morningthe tramps touching earnestness in rescuing his angel from a life of abjection is simple and selfless and deeply moving I would say it also fades out at the perfect moment of openended ambiguitythe viewer is forced to make resonant meaning out of the final troublingly cathartic shot even as the film articulates a consistent worldview in relation to what has come before In my eyes Modern Times is Chaplins masterpiece but City Lights would probably better merit repeat viewings which is as much a testament to the films power as anything else,8
364,tt0021749,City Lights is probably one of the most well loved along with Modern Times Chaplin movies The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp one of the most lovable truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps like they are labeled lazy and troublesome It is very hard to hate The Tramp because he gives so much when he has so little He spends his time and money giving to people  whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl Undoubtedly we all have a little bit of The Tramp in usThe plot is as follows the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street She is poor and by a mere coincidence believes that The Tramp is rich He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide and despite his gratefulness doesnt remember the poor tramp unless he is drunkCity Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history Its poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy I believe it is a strong mixture of both and a great balance of the two Both comedic and touching City Lights should not be missed by anyone,8
365,tt0021749, its perhaps a test of a persons outlook to ask them what they see in the final scene If theyve never seen City Lights before and they instantly notice the major continuity issue Chaplin holds a flower to his lapel from the rear shot its up to his mouth on his close up then maybe theyve placed film studies over romanceIt took a few viewings before I spotted this and once I did I cant help but notice it Yet even despite this I never fail to get choked up on the beauty of that final scene If you want to impress the right kind of girl put it on and show her what a sensitive soul you are during those final momentsAs for the rest of the film then while the final five minutes are classic and perhaps the best thing Chaplin ever did the rest of it is episodic and patchy necessitating my relatively low score Still a fine film but never a completely great one what presages those beautiful final moments is merely fine entertainment,7
366,tt0021749,If i have to choose which movie have the best ending it is very easy to choose city lights it is very very easy Chaplin was genius seriously genius This is the movie that truly inspire me After i watch city lights i just know there is such a movie power that exist in this world that can move and touch me really deep I never feel such a sharp sensation ever from any hundred movies i watch before and this movie pierce me through the heart within silent only gesture eye contact and cameraworks with no dialoguesometimes i try to analyze deeply why this movie have such a magnificent power i think the reason is the connection between scenes if we ask ourself what makes a good ending ? maybe the answer is how good you make the scene before the ending how good you correlate the prologue and epilogue and also between them how you fill the midduration of a movie if the director took a right decision a movie will not have any wasted scenes its only genius filmmaker can do and chaplin is one of themsilent movie such as city light is a hardkind of movie to made it needs next level of acting skill from the actors and actresses because there are no dialogue in it and most of the duration this movie is flawless in casting and the ending scene were unbelievable and unpredictable maximum genuine artbeauty of silent moviei recommend everybody to watch this movie at least once this movie is special it definitely will pierce you,10
367,tt0021749,As always the little tramp is fleeing the long arm of the law when he is mistaken for a wealthy man by a blind girl selling flowers by the roadside While he longs to help her the tramp knows he cannot However when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon a drunken man who he helps out who may be able to help him in turn  if the two of them can sober up long enoughIn response to seeing some modern trash posing as comedies recently Little Man Norbit Pluto Nash  Im looking at you I decided to check out some comedies that have stood the test of time  a few Chaplin films being among them City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start As was often the case this film has a thin narrative but one that allows for several scenarios for Chaplin to work his magic And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole filmThe statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at His support do no more than that  support him  but yet they are also roundly good Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character while Myers Garcia Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside ChaplinCity Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent setpieces that tickle and also stick in the mind So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead,0
368,tt0021749,Do you really need to post a spoiler warning for a movie that as of tonight is  years old?I havent read other reviews so forgive me if I repeat any previous postings City Lights is with nary a doubt the greatest love story ever told Forget Casablanca Forget An Affair to Remember Forget Love Story For the love of Christ forget Love Story This is a movie about the purest loveWe have the simple ubiquitous Tramp He is smitten with a blind flower girl who has mistaken him for a wealthy man There is a new operation that cures blindness and the Tramp will do anything to help Flower Girl regain her sight He tries to win a boxing match in which he is clearly outclassed In an era that is forgotten in modern times pun gleefully intended he cleans the streets of dung One of the best sight gags in screen history happens when the Tramp has to clean up after an elephant Finally he steals from a wealthy man to get the money he needs to pay for Flower Girls operationAnd then after he has spent many years in prison the Tramp is reunited with Flower GirlMy fellow males this is a wonderful Chick Flick If your lady friend isnt reduced to tears by the last  minutes of this movie you need to find a new lady Ive seen it a dozen times and it always gets to me,0
369,tt0021749,Four years into sound Charlie Chaplin wrote performed directed and scored one of films finest masterpiecesThe story is about the Little Tramp befriending a blind woman who mistakenly thinks he is rich Along the way he manages to get into a series of unintentional fixes with a large cast of foils at his disposal as he struggles to finance an operation for the womanIn an incredible display of comic talent Chaplin bombards the audience with scene after scene of magnificently choreographed comedy Drunk dancing or boxing his graceful slapstick is a rare combination of comedy and beauty a comic ballet Chaplins performing artistry as well as his ideas reach their apex with City Lights where only Chaplin would dare to challenge the naturally progressive trend and technological status quo by daring to make a silent By pulling it off with aplomb he solidified his place atop the history of the profession Some sound is used sparingly brilliantly with a statue dedication and a piano keyboard but no intelligible words are uttered The track and Chaplins score is lyrical energized and integral The film is perfectly constructedIn the masterful hands of Chaplin he avoids bathos in his scenes with the blind woman by severing the sentimentality and the scene with a comic moment saving it all for the incredibly touching and moving finale Up until then it is a display of comic genius that only a handful of others might lay claim to,10
370,tt0021749,As much as I loved The Kid The Gold Rush Modern Times and The Great Dictator City Lights is the film I consider Charlie Chaplins masterpiece And there are several reasons why this is so for meI love how City Lights is filmed once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets The music is also a delightthough my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times with plenty of themes that stuck in my head while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand The comedy is brilliantly done the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin moviealong with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator but ever in a comedy while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girlplayed touchingly by Virginia Cherrill he falls in love with And I also found the closeup climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity Chaplin is superb his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with CherrillOverall yet another Chaplin masterpiece yet for me this is the best of them all / Bethany Cox,10
371,tt0021749,Charlie Chaplin made some extremely funny shorts but of his longer films this is one of the best along with The Gold Rush and Modern Times Two stories are woven together One is Charlies onagain offagain friendship with a wealthy drunk The guy has a case of multiple personality When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts When hes sober he doesnt recognize Charlie at allThe second story involves a pretty blind flower girl who given certain distances angles and lighting resembles Uma Thurman Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballsCharlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy hes sober and wont support Charlies story Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel broke and bitter he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands The happy endingTheres sentimentality in the story of course There often is in Chaplins later films But as usual its somehow tempered Here its undercut by ironyWhen Charlie meets the wealthy toff the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope Hes about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes gives him a pep talk and changes his mind His spirit revived the rich guy spread his arms to the sky dropping the boulder that falls on Charlies footAnd when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl shes enthralled by his gentleness Unseen by her the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain himself enraptured Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlies face Well its not the blind Mr Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W C Fields general store but what is? A note There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film not counting the DempseyTunney debacle but I dont think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed hereIts hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this Black and white and silent Applause please,8
372,tt0021749,City Lights  **** out of Charlie Chaplin returns as The Tramp and this time he falls in love with a blind girl Virginia Cherrill and sets out to help her The Tramp eventually meets a suicidal drunk Harry Myers and their friendship leads to what might eventually help the girl he lovesChaplin made great films before and after CITY LIGHTS but for my money this here is his greatest film as well as one of the greatest films ever made Not only is it one of the funniest movies ever made but Id also argue that its one of the greatest love stories if not the greatest It really says a lot when a movie can conqueror two genres at one time but CITY LIGHTS is simply one of the greatest movies ever madeI think it says a lot that you get one classic scene after another and theres really not a weak spot to be found here Being  it took some real guts for Chaplin to deliver a silent film and I think he knew that he had to deliver something special because people had moved onto sound He certainly delivered something special as this here was easily the funniest film he had made up to this point The opening sequence with the introduction of The Tramp was priceless and we got one hilarious scene after another from that point The scenes with the drunk are downright hilarious as is another scene where The Tramp is trying to eat but without much success The cigar sequence is a masterpiece as is the by the water In fact the story between The Tramp and the drunk would have made a terrific movie on its own Just like the stuff with The Tramp and the blind girl would have made a perfect film Whats so special is that you get both stories wrapped up in one and it really deliversChaplin played The Tramp countless times but he was never better than he is here Just check out the timing in countless scenes including the boxing match and you cant help but be impressed with the actor Myers also deserves a lot of credit as the drunk as his timing has to match that of Chaplin throughout and the two men do a wonderful job together Then youve got Cherrill who wasnt a professional actor but the director makes her shine throughoutCITY LIGHTS contains one great scene after another and all of the laughs lead up to one of the most powerful endings in film history Theres really not enough great things that can be said about this film as it continues to get better with each passing year,0
373,tt0012349,While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplins later features The Kid is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicelyWhile its a fairly simple story this is one of Chaplins most efficiently designed movies  Every scene either is necessary to the plot or is very funny for its own sake or both  Except for Chaplin and Coogan most of the other characters even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance are just there to advance the plot when needed and the two leads are allowed to carry the show which they both do extremely wellThe Kid is also impressive in that while the story is a sentimental one it strikes an ideal balance maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies  Here the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorableThis is one of Chaplins very best movies by any measure  If you enjoy silent comedies dont miss it,0
374,tt0012349,Ive always thought theres a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies even unsentimental ones like Keatons The General or Laurel and Hardys Way Out West The latter comedy has a scene where L&amp;H perform a softshoe dance; it always brings me to tears Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that Im laughing doesnt dilute the emotional chargeOne of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already Why not marry the two things? Thats what he did in some of his early short films and thats what he does in this feature comedy The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie Jackie Coogan away Meanwhile the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesnt know if shell ever find out what became of himJackie Coogan about five in this film with his charming manners his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy is one of the alltime great child actors Want more evidence of Chaplins genius? Coogan doesnt steal the film from him This is true even though Chaplin as producer star and director makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boys talents Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles like My Boy and Oliver TwistChaplins storytelling—even with the foolish subDickensian plot twists such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed The windowbreaking scene the flophouse scene the dream sequence the tryingtogetridofthebaby scene—theyre perfect Chaplins celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselvesWant me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know I cant even complain about that Its too sweetly naïve And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the very few flawsOne important note children love this movie Show it to them while theyre young and youll make Chaplin fans of them And thats better than their becoming fans of almost anything thats being peddled to them,0
375,tt0012349,Wow is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so That fact that it still entertains over  years after it was made is quite a testimony It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama Charlie Chaplins unique humor combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember Chaplins humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stuntsThe kid  Jackie Coogan  is just as memorable maybe even more so He is unbelievably cute especially in those oldtime clothes he wore Watching the expressions on his face even as a baby are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent eraSo between Chaplin and Coogan and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next its an amazing piece of work This is a very fastpaced story which lasts less than an hourThe special edition twodisc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear actually astounding for its age Excellent entertainment,9
376,tt0012349,THE KID First National Pictures  a comedydrama written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  plays an important part his screen career Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIES PUNCTURED ROMANCE  a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies but releases coming once every two to three years A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in  eventually under the supervision and direction of himself Chaplins methods in movie making improved with each passing film Like himself Jackie Coogan Chaplins littlest costar and title character made such an impression with his initial performance nearly upstaging his impresario that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own becoming Hollywoods first important child starTHE KID starts off with intertitles A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear followed by The woman whose sin was motherhood titles much to the liking of a DW Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish yet in fact might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplins whose very name personifies comedy A young girl Edna Purviance leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father Carl Miller a young artist never returns to her life The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away Crooks enter the scene stealing the car discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else but after stumbling upon a note which reads Please love and care for this orphan child he decides to raise the child himself Five years pass The kid whose name is believed to be John now Charlies adopted son and sidekick start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money As for the kids mother shes become a star of great prominence devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts where lives the kid The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions unaware of each others identities When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention a middleaged country doctor having discovered Charlie not the boys true father sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child awayTHE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product especially for a silent movie made so long ago Chaplin who constructs his gags to perfection has one difficult scene that comes off naturally this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as hes lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot a substitute for a baby bottle back into his mouth Another classic moment on a serious nature is when Charlie is being held back by authorities being forced to watch his crying son taken away from him Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as hes being chased by a policeman from the slanted rooftops The closeup where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on filmChaplin and little Jackie billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin right down to his baggy pants Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances is so convincing that it doesnt take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp From this point onward he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor at the same time adding more plot pathos and truly great comedy routinesAs much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that followsTHE KID which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years was resurrected in the s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in  It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in  as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection double billed along with a comedy short THE IDLE CLASS  In the DVD format the two disc set includes rare outtakes and deleted scenes Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library where it made its debut December   during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights hosted by Robert Osborne and later in March  when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its Star of the MonthFor its age THE KID holds up extremely well thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan Theres no doubt Jackie Coogan  became an overnight star with this one film He was a natural While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again on screen anyway without them there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID ****,10
377,tt0012349,The Kid is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplins oeuvre Chaplin hadnt filled a film so fully with pathos since The Vagabond  and then it was in a very limited way subject to the confines of tworeel length Additionally Sunnyside  was a failure The feature length of The Kid also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags pranks and set pieces and with the support of Jackie Coogan its one of his funniest comediesThe parentchild relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment and for me not many have neared Chaplin in exploiting that formula in The Kid The sequence where they take the kid for a workhouse away from the tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the filmor of all film In addition to Chaplin and Coogan Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture Furthermore Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totherohs photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist but the musical score added to the  release composed by Chaplin taken from Tchaikovsky gives the sentimental parts its most verveOf the slapstick one of my favorite scenes involves the tramp in fear of a bully Its reminiscent of his Mutual short Easy Street  which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film Yet The Kid is much more than that which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplins previous work This was the beginning of the tramp as the sympathetic pitiful hero as well as clown thats so recognizable and beloved to this dayMoreover the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect Its also funny in a silly way Its somewhat analogous to the outer reality story although with much ambiguity I wasnt always sure Chaplin was making any clear point such as with the Christ image earlier in the film but that seems unimportant; The Kid affects the emotions and isnt especially aimed at engaging the mind At six reels with more sets and a developed plot this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplins previous films; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth thus making The Kid Chaplins first complete feature,9
378,tt0012349,It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as The Kid It is a silent movie but so rich winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words Chaplin and year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness And I really never cry in movies And the musicits simply Oscarlevel! The movie is sympathetic full of feeling touchingly funny moments It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over  years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age don´t miss it,10
379,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous His character the Tramp is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early th century but something all of us can overcomeIn one of his first roles with this character he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family Taking himself and this very talented young boy Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote directed starred in and composed the score for this filmHere Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own He hasnt got much but he does have love which is more than can be said for the childs motherFlash forward five years and now the mother wants her son back Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion Even so the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks things not used much at the time in the movies Using these little tricks and ideas Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the storyHowever at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh sometimes in the same scene This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it,8

381,tt0012349,Its easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius but Ill say it once again the man was a genius if only at doing a certain particular kind of film You wouldnt ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film or at least one like out of Germany or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the s and s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and the usual kickedaround word manipulated amid the comedic setups Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the KidAs it stands even at  minutes which was trimmed by Chaplin himself  years after its original release and including a new musical score its just about a perfectly told tale It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that Dreamland sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful lightanddark examination of all the major characters in the picture now with angel wings and devil horns! What its about in complete basics is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she wont be able to take care of him and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at and the Tramp decides to take care of him he even names him in one amusing aside John Then it cuts to  years later and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows eat lots of pancake and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an Older Brother of a kid John gets in a fight with Meanwhile the mother is now a success not knowing her child is somewhere right in front of her noseThis may sound like a bit of story but its told briskly and without a missed beat in editing and Chaplins reedit tightens it to a point where were mostly with the Kid and the Tramp Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be playful absurd cute and bittersweet to a degree We know this cant exactly last but the moment the poor maybesick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic and yet partially triumphant sequences in the movies Its in a case like this where we as the audience tear up more or less as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out and then intercut with Chaplins daring dash across the rooftops to save him that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film silent or otherwise; that its silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true even a beat with the Kid playing with toys an obviously cute bit is great and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like ChaplinFeaturing some excellent setpieces just unto themselves aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that bellylaugh part with the repetitive brickhit to the head or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin and excellent performances from all supporting cast including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance its altogether an aweinspiring feat To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness,10
382,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid the cute little Jackie Coogan has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos and true to what you would expect of his best work does it superbly  The tramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding a little boy to the mix was the finishing touch  Look out too for little Lita Grey in the angel sequence who would become Chaplins nd wife four years after this film was made,0
383,tt0012349,What makes a feature film different to a short? It isnt just length After all some of Charlie Chaplins later shorts were as long as fortyfive minutes while The Kid is barely an hour No when Chaplin made his graduation to fulllength features he also strove to broaden the scope scale and above all the dignity of his work The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplins careerThe Kid begins with a bit of backstory as a few of Chaplins shorts do but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this Here we have the opening of a drama and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief Of course such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short but here that wouldnt be appropriate Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laughoutloud funny but they certainly dont belong in a straight dramatic setting And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room sceneAnd never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration but still very natural by the standards of the time And of course little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive his movements expressions and timings all spoton so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness and he appears more like a human cartoon character Coogan steals the picture with ease and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously asideThis too is an important difference with The Kid Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act famously severing his partnership with the funnyinhisownright Ben Turpin back in  Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own The few examples such as the routine with the policemans wife and the window ledge are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material However he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this outToday The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful featurelength spinoff If you look at something like the minute Christmas special of The Office it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode Chaplins full length features however were far more than just spinoffs and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work,9
384,tt0012349,The Kid became a critically hailed international hit A tramp Charles Chaplin brings up an abandoned baby Jackie Coogan and later loses him to his mother Edna Purviance; but there is a happy endingThe film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums The comedy is sparingly laid on but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest The production is comparatively smooth young Coogan is sensational and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced His inspiration it is suggested was the death of his own first son Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in ,10
385,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins first full length feature film and his biggest success up to that date is a remarkably heartwarming story  which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy It begins with a woman whos sin was motherhood who gives birth to a baby she cant support at a Charity Hospital which is kept padlocked from the inside She is forced to abandon it in an alley and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film as he is casually strolling by and then through a series of odd but entirely believable situations he is unable to get rid of it It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin who was in top form playing the little boy at  years old Charlies life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplins traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed dramatic story The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments sometimes simultaneously if you can believe that but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival and it is never once predictable all the way until the last frameThere is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy and in between rounds  Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well and giving him hints for the rest of the fight Meanwhile the other kids brother shows up a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankensteins monster than anything else What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street This is a slapstick setup that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time were it not for its direct relevance to the storyAt another point there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home as the  version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackies arms I think this is the only time in any film that Ive ever seen genuine lowbrow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident This combination not just here but throughout the film is The Kids biggest achievement There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about although my understanding is that volumes have been written about its symbolic meaning both within the movie and in reference to Chaplins personal life And speaking of which supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing I dont know which story to believe that it was because of Chaplins painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary I would bet its a little of both but the film is here and I guess ultimately thats all that matters In the five or six times that Ive seen The Kid I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramps real son either on screen or off Then again I am looking at it with st century eyes Some of Shirley Temples early films are also a little disturbing to me although for not quite the same reasons By this time Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films and after  short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond along with a few assorted others Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema,10

387,tt0012349,The simple lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch Id say that it is as much funny as sad and the music score couldnt be more accuratePerhaps the most delightful surprise was to In the dreamland scene So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated the scene made me question myself if at the moment I was watching Buñuel and not Chaplin It is not my Chaplins favorite but its for sure one of his bests Totally recommend to be watched Chaplin will never disappoint you thats for sure If you watch this one also with City Lights and Modern Times youll be ready to enjoy his talkies The Great Dictator a classic and the perfect touching till tears Limelight,9
388,tt0012349,Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five yearsIn reading Charlie Chaplins memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him The second thing was Chaplins determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be doneThe success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they dont totally steal the film from youThe Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid Hes the same rapscallion Tramp we all know but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp one of deep feeling and protectiveness Two people who need and love each other very much This film couldnt missFirst National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin the studio and his estranged wife Mildred Harris The Robert Downey Jr biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itselfTill that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid,9
389,tt0012349,The Kid was released in  at the pinnacle of the Silent era when emotions came to screen through looks and body language when we didnt need dialog we had faces And if theres one film where Charlie Chaplins face oddly illuminates the screen its definitely The Kid Sure many fans would argue that City Lights is Chaplins masterpiece but something is too perfect too masterfully directed it was made during the talking era Chaplin was in his s and had more experience while The Kid features a more youthful director It belongs to a whole other era and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed in  Chaplin was  Hitchcock  Brando wasnt even born discovering The Kid is like turning the pages of a dusty yellowpaged historical book one eye is watching the film while the other discovers a period And I dont know if Im the only one but theres something in the setting the location that makes the film look even older For all I saw the movie could have been set in the early century and considering the timing of the film maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin himself The film was made in a difficult personal time when hed just lost his son after his birth There was a great wound in Chaplins heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragementThe context of The Kid is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time which is even more impressive considering his sevenyear experience a short time but enough to create an icon the Little Tramp an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema Chaplins story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and Im sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame  and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a filmmakerThe Emigrant in  was like the first step back into Chaplins past inspired by his own experience The movie doesnt feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future and leaving the motherland wasnt synonym of sadness but the emotions were there beyond the slapstick and the comedy and waiting for another step back to finally explode in an emotional firework which directly transports us to Chaplins past He who grew up without a father and started working at an early age he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living before it cemented his talent he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin And this is how The Kid was made and for the first time Chaplin would become more than a simple clown and get all the respect he needed from his peers as a gifted filmmaker He could finally make his first masterpiece The Gold Rush but The Kid was this necessary last breath before taking the big diveMany aspects of The Kid highlight Chaplins past and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs  a woman abandons a child expecting him to be adopted by a rich family until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramps arms But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who despite the archetypal situations didnt make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt as is the father a nicelooking fellow and a sign that Chaplin doesnt hold any grief against his father These things happen and we shouldnt feel sorry as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos  the Tramp and the KidIn every aspect the Kid is Chaplins alter ego  hes smart tender funny sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing Weve seen so many child performances since  to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is and Jackie Coogan is one of the best if not the best almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy and that the kid didnt become as much a star as Chaplin is one of cinemas cruelest ironies The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense closeups on Chaplins face  his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen and whatever inhabits the Tramps heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himselfChaplin like Disney for animation handled drama with the same strength as for comedy the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy fun cheers and even some dreamy escapism allowing a selfreflexive approach of the magic of childhood The Kid is not perfect but its a masterpiece of sincerity of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music If not his best its his most defining film ,9
390,tt0012349,This is such a incredible movieAlong with City Lights and The Gold Rush this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin and it is also one of the best movies ever madeIt is true that for the modern viewers the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the boxofficeThat doesnt mean this movie isnt entertaining In fact I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny comedies and also way more emotional and engagingI truly loved this film It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldnt be forgotten,10
391,tt0012349,The opening title to this film reads A film with a smile  and perhaps a tear Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken for Charlie Chaplins The Kid has a plethora of smiles from start to finish and yes a few tears as well The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character played by Chaplin The Tramp takes the baby into his own care Five years go by and the Tramp and the Kid portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan are getting along just fine However a turn of events results in the two being separated and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his sonCharlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking and this film is one of his best His direction is truly remarkable being able to manipulate the audiences emotions so much without sound He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget He manages to make you laugh almost nonstop from start to finish and even wind up causing you to shed a tear Its so emotionally gripping and you just fall in love with these characters from the getgo Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinemaAs emotionally wrenching this film is its simply hilarious This film has some great slapstick humor and Chaplin is a true master of it Jackie Coogan is also great If I had to find one flaw with the film it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I dont really mind it despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film Overall The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute then tug at your heartstrings the next Its an absolute riot but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema Ive ever seen And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue its just incredible And not to mention the music is just stellar too Chaplin is a master at composition The Kid is one of my favorite films and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!,10
392,tt0012349,When watching this I wanted to give the film a  rather than an  simply because I do not think it is as good as Modern Times or one or two others However taking into account that this is  and the film technology is not all there I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done it could have been made a decade later and looked the sameChaplin has to of course be given a lot of credit for producing writing directing and starring Being a great comic actor is one thing but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid and they nailed it  hes adorable emotional and seems able to handle any situation,8
393,tt0012349,The worlds most famous tramp is back and this time he has kid sidekick! Sounds kind of gimmicky right? But it works perfectly! Chaplin and child actor Jackie Coogan work extremely well together Their scenes are filled with heart and you can see that they both enjoyed themselves during the making of the movie The movie has the signature Chaplin slapstick that is guaranteed to have you in stitches but it also has some genuinely sad and emotional moments making this movie one of Chaplins most fondly remembered from his gigantic and legendary filmography,10
394,tt0012349,A tramp finds an abandoned kid on the street He tries to get rid of it in Charlie Chaplin way but ends up raising it with road side values Child becomes an apple of his eyes in a few years but the mother comes back to claim her son I had heard that this was the best movie Charlie Chaplin made but I disagree with that statement completely No doubt its a fantastic movie with a very strong story and message but its definitely not his best I found the last scene of the movie a little contrite and compromising The story has been adapted and tried in very many forms Extremely sensitive and though provoking cinema A must see for all,8
395,tt0012349,I was hardly a Chaplin fan in fact I loved Laurel &amp; Hardy and really didnt like Charlie Chaplin until I found that I could impersonate him as a lookalike  Then while viewing his films for the need of impersonating I have become a big Charlie Chaplin fan  His comedy mingled with pasos and pantomime was unique and very funny; and this one is certainly one of his bestIn it a sixyear old Jackie Coogan makes his screen debut as a little orphan that the tramp picks up and cares for five years  Every moment of this film is terrific it moves along swiftly and made me shed a tear three or few times  Chaplins score is undeniably a great piece of artwork and the acting is superb; nobody in this film lacksespecially ChaplinI recommend this film for all to see  Its age has not diminished this little love tale for a family in fact it makes you realize family love even more  Youll laugh cry and have a great time out  Rent it  Buy it View it  Its a film for all to see,0
396,tt0012349,They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but Im not so sure anymore There has been a generational discontinuity at least in the USA that seems to have happened about  or  years ago I suspect that most people over the age of  could identify Charlie Chaplin and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinctionGenerally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation but Jackie Coogan is an exceptionSentimental manipulation there is but its mainly limited to one or two scenes The comedy is pretty acerbic Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again Thats not what passes for sentimentalityBesides Coogan is cute when hes  or  years old a ragamuffin dressed in floppy oversized bags of clothing so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it And the kid can act tooCharlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him which was all he had to do Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because hes too inexperienced to know how to overact Chaplain is good too of course How could one person be so inventive? Its said that TV eats up talent because of the constant demand for new material One of the better series Twilight Zone had about three good years of collaborative effort in it Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in  films and directed something like  of them and he was just getting startedIll give one example of a joke without an iota of sentiment in it to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid a big bully who knocks him about Chaplain spots this interrupts the fight and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing  go for the belly keep your guard up  and sends him back into the fight At this point the bullys hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says If your boy beats my boy Im going to beat you Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bullys chin and flattens him But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back Chaplain dashes over puts his foot on the Coogans chest to hold him down quickly counts to ten rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand  the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy Youll enjoy it Especially if youre one of those rare folks under  with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue,0
397,tt0012349,A picture with a smile and perhaps a tearThat is the first line of the movie as it begins and it stands true We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling Wow I cant say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story Now we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally recent great movie is Finding Nemo But whats special about this movie is simplicty honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into usDone by the genius Chaplin there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling we either smile or bring tears So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do are done there Winning over a fight from a neighbour meeting angels and all Now look at the editing in this less than an hour film its neat and precise The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film Acting is sublime by Chaplin only few can do what he did and even today hardly anyone can match him Its a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch atlas watch it before you die you may learn something you never wanted to miss Its / for one of the finest silent movies ever,10
398,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is one of Chaplins best films as well as one of his most famous It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by and its not hard to see why Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector a young miner during the gold rush After getting caught in a storm he hurries to the only shelter that he can find a wood cabin in the middle of the storm It turns out that it is already inhabited and by a tough criminal named Black Larson no less and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim another prospector insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film,10
399,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is pure gold  It was Charlie Chaplins third featurelength film and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris  which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp  This movie should be counted among Chaplins best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights which Ive also seen as THE best Chaplin movie but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedys immortal geniusesHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV I saw it again in October  as part of my colleges silentfilm class on a poorquality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen ,10
400,tt0015864,Charles Chaplins The Gold Rush is arguably his finest film He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich What he does not realize is that he may find love in the form of Georgia Hale instead of money In the end that may be all right with him The Gold Rush shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer writer and director he was Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the th Century Chaplin showed humanity love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career The movie is exceptional in every way Although I am not as wellversed with movies from the s as I am with the decades following it I would still probably call The Gold Rush the finest film of that year period Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today  stars out of ,0
401,tt0015864,The  Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious As an unnamed prospector Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner the dancing roles and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff His companion Big Jim McKay Mack Swain at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplins character to be a chicken and before long a bear enters their cabin In the midst of it all the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia Georgia HaleA real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!,10

Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered and I can see why It is a masterful blend of comedy drama and romance among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture Like all great movies The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramps flawless physical comedy He was a master of comedic timing and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians Ive ever seen Dont get me wrong this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler The film moves along at a brisk pace following the misadventures of our hero The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin of course as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska Along his journey through the elements the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen Tom Murray a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold Fortunately our friend also comes across a fellow prospector Big Jim McKay Mack Swain who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich But the Lone Prospectors adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere When he is forced back to civilization he falls in love with Georgia Georgia Hale the most beautiful girl in town Of course it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite the handsome ladys man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia as well Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the egomaniacal lady killer All of this would be too much for any one of us but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie I am a fan of Charlie Chaplins movies but as objective as I can possibly be this IS one of the great moviesEssential viewing!,10
403,tt0015864,This silent classic has many strong points  it has a lot of humor interesting characters a good story and good settings  Its the kind of film that shows how much a master filmmaker can communicate in a silent movie  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion but other than that its a fine filmChaplin himself plays the Lone Prospector and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors rickety cabins plus some other good materialThe version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin reedited in the s adding his own narration and deleting the title cards which gives it a slightly different feel  These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who arent used to silent films You can tell from Chaplins narration how fond he must have been of The Gold Rush and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art,0
404,tt0015864,Charlie Chaplins silent film also rereleased with a narration in the early s focuses as usual on the Little Tramp and in this case his attraction to a chorus girl Georgia Hale This is the one where he eats a boot along with its laces and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rollsThe role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin Lita Grey but her pregnancy ruled her out Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions Mack Swain appears as Big Jim who shares a cabin with the Tramp at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and goldrunners as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time as a sound film it is fairly good,8
405,tt0015864,Ive seen both version of this filmthe original silent version from  and the rerelease by Chaplin in the s The difference is that the rerelease was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies To do this title cards were removedhaving Chaplin narrate the film In addition Chaplincreated music for the most partsome were classical pieces sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVDit has both plus excellent DVD extras Otherwise there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out theremany with terrible quality prints or music or both The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the  rereleaseI use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film though I might in the future use it for my Psychology classes as well I teach both because Chaplins genius came from his obsessivecompulsive nature The movie reportedly had  times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than  takes!! The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century Along the way he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb Suffice to say the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch something not true of all fulllength slapstick comediessometimes their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to fulllengthThis is a gorgeous wellexecuted piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac The musical score arranged by Chaplin direction acting and cinematography all are simply perfectmaking this in my opinion the best fulllength silent comedy ever made This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keatons films!,10
406,tt0015864,If any single figure can fairly be said to symbolize the glory years of the silent filmsthe cinemas truly international epochit is Charles Chaplins indomitable tramp The Little Fellow as millions came to call him was at once tatty and debonair browbeaten and irrepressibly optimisticand he was without question the bestloved international star in all of film history His coat was too small his pants too large his mustache patently falseand the resultant silhouette instantly recognizable wherever movies were shown Charlie Chaplins tramp spoke to all walks of lifeand never more eloquently than in such silent films as The Kid and The Gold Rush The Gold Rush is superb It deals with Charlies adventures to win the affection of a local dancehall girl and his hilarious efforts to avoid being eaten by bears and by prospectors who are bigger and hungrier than he The most memorable scene is one in which he dines on an old shoe Chaplins exquisite grace turned the boiled shoe into a gourmet feast he carves it carefully smacks his lips in anticipation and then eats it with gusto and appreciation sucking the nails as if they contained the most juices and twirling the laces around his fork as if they were spaghetti,10
407,tt0015864,In Charles Chaplins  film The Gold Rush a lone prospector travels to California looking for gold and entwines himself in adventures and finds Georgia the woman of his dreams After many hardships including a relocating cabin the lone prospector played by Charles Chaplin finds gold and becomes rich ending in success and unity with Georgia The time period in which this movie was shot compared with the technological innovation and the state of the art filming techniques give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel The use of upclose shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a new feel to the style of silent cinema The scene with the cabin shifting and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin was one of the many stylistic filming techniques that gave The Gold Rush such artistic and ingenious appeal Chaplins ideas and his vision that he brought to life in the movie The Gold Rush make it a great landmark in the beginning of silent films and in film history The intricate but simple story of The Gold Rush brought about many distinct feelings when viewing It gives feelings of happiness during scenes where there is comedic relief and slapstick comedy and also can bring about sadness or pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Years but she never shows up It reveals how silent films can become in touch with a persons feelings making them feel for the protagonist without having to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot These aspects of The Gold Rush make it a milestone in the film industry of the modern world,9
408,tt0015864,One of the best Chaplin movies which means one of the best movies ever made Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as `Eating the shoe and `The Roll Dance Both the original version and the second release have their own charm,10

410,tt0015864,We follow the little fellow Chaplin in his trip to Alaska to find gold  which he ends up succeeding in finding love at the same time The first half of the movie reunites Chaplin another lonesome gold seeker and a moralless scoundrel in a shelter under a particularly horrendous snowstorm There happens one of the most memorable scene of the movie Big Jims delusion that Chaplins is a giant of course bearing Chaplins manners chicken and his desperate attempts to eat him; but Chaplin is saved by a bear showing up which they finally eat Then parting their ways begins the second half of the movie the onesided romance with the beautiful Georgia met in a dance hall How funny was the scene when she invited out of despair our little fellow to dance to avoid dancing with an invading Jake! How genius showed Chaplin to use TchaykovskysBeauy &amp; the Beasts waltz! Bringing to tear and laughters at the same time As Georgia plays nastily and mocks and fools Chaplin with her friends and secretly discovers his love her heart swings But Chaplin is taken away by his former colleague Big Jim to become millionaires ie find gold And they find it!

411,tt0015864,All the best Chaplin films have one unique scene thats very memorable because its either very funny or very touching In this film its one of the funny onesYou see in this film Chaplin jumps on the band wagon to Alaska to participate in the Gold Rush Along the way he runs into some crazy characters and has to stay out in the middle of nowhere with one of them Since they must try to survive in the cold weather Chaplin decides to cook dinner What he cooks and how they eat it is the priceless joke that makes this film so greatIts not just that one joke though there are tons of laughs in this great movie So I highly recommend it for any fan of silent films or comedies Youll have a lot of fun watching itAs of now this is the earliest Charlie Chaplin film that Ive seen but it probably wont be for long I think hes one of the greatest directors and I hope to see more of his films soon,10
412,tt0015864,THE GOLD RUSH United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations So proud of his achievement Chaplin reissued this silent film in  with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself eliminating the use of title cards Then in the summer of  THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting stations week series of The Silent Years as hosted by Orson Welles from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William PerryTHE GOLD RUSH which is set in the turn of the century opens with The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin coming to Alaska A snow storm drives him into the cabin of Black Lawson Tom Murray an outlaw Big Jim McKay Mack Swain another prospector who has found gold on his claim is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin After much struggle Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests Stranded due to the heavy storm Larson finds himself chosen to go out for help While out in the storm he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him He gets away by stealing their dog sled but is later killed in an avalanche Back to the cabin Charlie and Larson almost in near starvation eventually make a meal out of a large bear When the snow storm finally subsides the two men go about their separate ways Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia Georgia Hale a dance hall girl causing jealousy from her suitor Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite As for Jim he has forgotten where his gold claim is and locates Charlie to help him find it separating him from Georgia The results that follow is classic ChaplinAside from a large list of supporting players which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis The Gold Rush contains many now classic comedy supplements including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlies encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement There are tender moments too including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Years Eve dinner with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for themWith THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplins most revived and discussed movie one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed including THE CIRCUS  CITY LIGHTS  MODERN TIMES  and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR  Since the advent of home video in the early s THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores ranging from the use of piano organ or orchestra There are even some editions that have no music track at all along with some copies running different time lengths and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout The  reissue being a shorter print with Chaplins narration not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics but can also be found on Chaplins th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a  comedy short PAY DAY Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection But in spite of numerous editions THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics  and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter  reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector avid lip readers will notice that he is called Charlie by his supporting players especially by Georgia ****,10
413,tt0015864,If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability t you a commend this film as well as City Lights  Modern Times isnt strictly speaking a silent film although Chaplin had no dialogue there  The Gold Rush while not Chaplins best film does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits it must be seen  Excellent film   version redone by Chaplin is a bit better but either will do  Most highly recommended,10
414,tt0015864,To be perfectly honest I wish I could denounce Chaplin more fervently than I find myself able to Right down to my fundamental worldview I am a Buster Keaton person the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness The world as I understand it just doesnt work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay So wishing it did only fosters more painThis is actually worst than The Kid in this respect Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold Oh though filthy rich at that point when in the end he falls practically in the girls arms he is again dressed like a tramp  meaning no doubt he is still the same person  but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul here he gets both There is not even the thought of a compromiseYet I cant help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplins cosmology; the mysterious elusive fates  seemingly random but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose  that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocksNowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside the reality thought to be known understood domesticated into order but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void So every step inside taken casually without much thought is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death Blissful ignorance the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabinIt is a powerful cosmologic symbol what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life With both gold and love impossible love with the dream girl as the chimeras that trick the mindSo Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside but either cannot properly understand – and confuses karma for providential fate  or he does is terrified and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy taleSo however wellmeant its a dishonest patronizing vision of bliss Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging but eventually benevolent whims of providence Its all made right again more than rightNotice how well integrated is this notion inside the film proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the pointofview of the tramp who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger souldefining mechanisms that shape his life that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lessonSo instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill just wait and itll all work out in the end It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the filmSure it is occasionally very funny inventive But were talking here about the more intricate mechanisms that drive a film  and film aspiring to be a truthful reflection of life life itself,0
415,tt0015864,This is the first silent film I have ever seen so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound other than the piano in the background in a  minute movie So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas acrossI felt like they did some of same gags over and over again like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove It just got really old to me quickly I dont know maybe because Im from a different time period and way life but the film just didnt do anything for me I didnt really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only  to  minutes long and nothing would have been lost,3
416,tt0015864,Make them laugh make them laugh The American comic tradition and American movies were made for each other Gold Rush is one example that Charlie Chaplin was the father of American comedy Even though Chaplin loves to press political economical or social messages in his films The Gold Rush remains true to its genre It is a comedy non the less Even at the end of the film when THE TRAMP receives a kiss Chaplin reminds the audience that she has ruined the picture with the kiss This is suppose to be a comedy!,9
417,tt0015864,Spoilers hereinI consider `City Lights to be a masterwork one of the films that every literate person must see This film is often equally celebrated but it seems to be a random collection of integrated ideas to me Some work most dontThe  rescore and voiceover is much tighter visually but sonicly heavy If you have a chance with the DVD see it in the  recut with no sound and subtitlesThe one skit that works the best is the famous dancing rolls bit You really must see three versions of this one after another Look at the original Then see the Robert Downey Jr version done in  almost  years later Notice how much more comic Downeys is because he uses a different timing and is both doing it and referencing the Chaplin dance Then see the Johnny Depp version of the year later which pokes fun at the Downey version and reannotates the original A work of genius overlain on a masterpieceOtherwise there are better silent comedies to see And better ChaplinTeds Evaluation   of  Has some interesting elements,0
418,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is a showcase of sorts for Chaplin In it he provides audiences with a wide range of cinematic elements from his signature slapstick routines to dramatic relationships The rags to riches plot was interesting and witty but felt dragged out While Chaplin is good at emotionally engaging the audience with relateable situations like getting stood up or competing for a woman the lack of serious conflict makes the film seem simple The special effects were handled nicely even by todays standards but the true enjoyment in the film comes from watching the tramp endure hardship as he accidentally progresses into wealthiness and sees his life fall together by favorable coincidence,6
419,tt0015864,Spoiler AlertThe Gold Rush is perhaps one of the best silent movies I have ever seenAlthough it takes a bit to get used to silent movie language youll be rewarded with a marvelousfunny and poignant movieSome of the scenes are hilarious and some really touches your heartstrings Chaplin as performer gives one of his best performances in this movie There are plenty of great scenesChaplin and Mack Swain in the cabincrazy with hunger and cabin feverthe touching New Years Eve party and finally the hilarious finale with the cabin out on the edge of a cliffThe later version which was released with added narration and music wasnt as good as the originalbut easier for modern audiences to watch,8
420,tt0015864,What a delightful film I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them like the eating shoe scene fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Years Eve knowing that he was stoodup I genuinely felt for him Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time Brilliant,10
421,tt0015864,The primitive production values the decrepitlooking camera work and the silent soundtrack with only musical scores to suffice for the lack of the talkie in that era does little to ruin the viewers chance of being entertained by this highly enjoyable classic masterpiece by Charlie Chaplin The Little Tramp finds himself in the Yukon braving the wintery elements bears and a psychopath all for the sake of claiming his own fortune of gold Under his expert direction Chaplin guides THE GOLD RUSH with painstaking detail of what life would be like to live in the freezing extremes having to shack up in a  cabin in danger of toppling over a snowcapped cliff and feasting on shoes for protein Amidst all the atrocities Chaplin being that likeable underdog that everybody roots for and loves overcomes the odds managing to make the best out of a bad read terrible situation He even takes the time to humor himself and a few ladies with a songanddance number involving two forks and a pair of potatoes,0
422,tt0015864,The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights?  There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator  There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramps world City Lights falls short  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what Charlot has been all about all along It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplins works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime  out of ,10
423,tt0017136,Technically speaking I have seen this Fritz Lang silent scifi before but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the s The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable apocalyptic fantasy and religious allegory It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers who toil in the depths tending the machines and the upper classes who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers The hero the idle pampered son of the citys supervisor Joh Fredersen changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria the Madonna of the workers His father meanwhile is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didnt see In addition to restoring scenes to the film the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version With these changes the story becomes much clearer particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis Perhaps most importantly a whole new subplot is added involving the heros dead mother Hel who was loved by both his father and Rotwang With this clarification of the backstory the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer In some ways it recalls the family backstory of the Star Wars movies Of course the real strength of Metropolis isnt the story which is pretty silly and probably wouldnt have worked in anything but a silent film but its amazing visuals which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to  and Blade Runner Actually though in most respects silent films now look primitive one area in which they have the edge over modern filmmaking is in their frequently grandiose production design Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world The models of the citys towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a s film Even beyond the expansive production design and for the time special effects Langs visuals are all consistently inventive The robot Maria provides some of the movies most iconic images including her transformation into a human being In a later scene she performs for upperclass men in a nightclub and as she performs a striptease that in s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs A sign of Langs visual lavishness and the studios that he doesnt hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a characters state of mind For instance when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idols head into which the workers are being sacrificed At another point while hes sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs labor parable and Lang gives us spectacular images of the towers construction and fall In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and overliteral but theyre what silent cinema does best tell a story without the advantage or obstacle of dialogue The story is a little slow to start but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that Ive seen In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films as the workers riot and sabotage the machines endangering the entire city Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than  years,9
424,tt0017136,Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the s? Sure some science fiction movies are huge today such as George Lucas latest goofy Star Wars movie but in  Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then And sure enough we went right ahead living the way we were living the population got bigger and more crowded and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society Metropolis was run by his father John Frederson the master of Metropolis He lives in a Pleasure Garden high above the level of the workers and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father given the terrible conditions under which they live and work Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic sinister looking machine The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devillooking monster  After countless workers are consumed by it no wonder this was Hitlers favorite film they are immediately replaced by other workers who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements If some of these scenes men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured and the rest of the workers keep right on working hardly even noticingThe way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated `Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups is a saying that doesnt necessarily only apply to stupid people as Metropolis suggests Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue and the result is still compelling today The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways except that the two films can hardly be compared  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least An excellent film Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten,10
425,tt0017136,I doubt that Id ever seen anything resembling a complete version of METROPOLIS before though certain of its scenes were familiar to me if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keatons HEAVEN   In any case whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration  I expected to be distracted by the restorations technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it  As exaggerated as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards some performances such as the Master of the city are amazingly nuanced and layered and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone The meticulous design of the film the unerring camera placement and Langs muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking Id thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity important = dull but now Ive come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been,10
426,tt0017136,Fritz Langs Metropolis is the first true masterpiece of science fiction in film You can see its influence in films such as Star Wars The Matrix Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Blade Runner and countless others Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were in some cases phenomenal I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is  years old because a lot has happened in film since then Yet if you look at the basic elements of this movie  its story characters artwork cinematography etc I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late s Also take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this The performances and set designs are going to be over the top That was part of the style Metropolis may not be for everyone but for those willing to read between the lines this film still has a lot to offer!,8
427,tt0017136,In the future the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes the workers who live in the underground below the machines level and the dominant classes that lives on the surface The workers are controlled by their leader Maria Brigitte Helm who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles Maria meets Freder Fredersen Gustav Fröhlich the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen Alfred Abel in a meeting of the workers and they fall in love for each other Meanwhile Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate themMetropolis is a fantastic futuristic view of the fight of classes When Metropolis was shot it was a romantic revolutionary period of mankind history with socialist movements around the world Fritz Lang directed and wrote the screenplay of this masterpiece certainly inspired in this historical moment and defending a position of agreement and understanding between both sides showing that they need each other I wonder how this great director was able to produce such special effects in  with very primitive cameras and equipment The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art My vote is tenTitle Brazil MetropolisNote On  March  I saw this film again on BluRay,10
428,tt0017136,Metropolis is surely one of the greatest films ever made  Its scope its reach its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by todays standards of filmmaking  Seen in context of its premier in  Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history  Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great and in particular Metropolis  A great film is one that stirs the imagination leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life and achieves a kind of immortality  Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria  Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings halluciatory scenes and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions  There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria  Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups  Lastly Metropolis has stood the test of time  It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre  The story itself is simplea Biblical allegory about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen  The film is anything but simple  It is immense and a rich legacy that director Fritz Lang has left us,0
429,tt0017136,I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie This is without a doubt the best scifi movie Ive ever seen! Let me explain my position We have all seen modern scifi movies and argued over which is the best ever made but those film makers have high speed film and computers Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in  and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must see for all persons interested in the history of film as well as just good fun for everyone The social metaphores as well as the religious and philosophical double meanings are a sight to behold,10
430,tt0017136,This must be one of the greatest movies of all time I found myself almost in a state of shock during the whole movie Everything was perfect The story was great the filming was pure genius and the effects directly from another dimensionI dont think any movie after this one have gotten so much out of the available effects of the time as this one Nowadays they have super computers generating special effects Sure they look good but its no big deal making them Back in  computers werent even invented yet all effects had to be done by hand or in simple editing And when you take a look at all the thins that have been done in this movie its impossible not to get impressed Huge buildings explosions flooding picture phones however did he come up with the very idea? transformation sequences robots and so on No movie has ever pulled the limits of special effects as much as this one Star Wars and Jurassic Park are also known as limit pullers in special effects but they dont even come closeThen you have the filming Everything is perfect The use of body language is tremendous the light setting perfect everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera Ive never been witness to such a treat in filming other placesAnd the story!!! Perfect in every detail Intriguing exciting and thrilling with lots of religious undertones and tyranic leaders No wonder Hitler liked this movieI dont know how the original music of the film was but the new music for the restored  minute version I saw was really good and moodsetingAll in all This is one of the most perfect movies of all time and it deserves anything it can get Never has a / been as secure as for this movie,10
431,tt0017136,Silent movies are not for everyone Neither are subtitles Those brave enough to view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between should definitely enjoy this silent masterpiece One of the biggest productions of its time Metropolis still holds its own when set design and special effects are compared But what Metropolis really has is orginality This GermanExpressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future modern city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern scifi Star Warss CPO was based on Bridgette Helms robot Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis lookalike cities This is a very good movie Its too bad most movies dont have its originality,9
432,tt0017136,Fritz Langs groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema How can a movie thatll soon turn  years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages The world has been divided into two main categories thinkers &amp; workers! If you belong to the first category you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if youre a worker your life isnt worth a penny and youre doomed to perilous labor underground The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself Its essential viewing anyway! Metropolis is a very demanding filmexperience and definitely not always entertaining But as it is often the case with silentcinema classics the respect and admiration youll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoymentaspect Fritz brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to recreate a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines Many supposedly restored versions have been released over the years in  and  for example but the version is still the finest in my opinion even though that one already isnt as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it Metropolis perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made  A Space Odyssey Star Wars and Blade Runner owe their existence or at least their power to it,8
433,tt0017136,Metropolis is my alltime favourite movie so Ive saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb Ive enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies Ive seen but now Im moving on to other passionsAlthough written by Fritz Langs wife Thea von Harbou Metropolis was originally Langs idea he was inspired by the sight of New Yorks skyscrapers when he sailed to America in  During his American trip he visited the set of The Phantom of the Opera and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasnt filmedDespite its epic power Metropolis makes very little sense The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen so why is the one named Freder*sen* the father not son of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwangs crude little cottage the only preFredersen building that wasnt demolished during the construction of this city? Von Harbous very long and unwieldy novelisation of her script establishes this fact but never explains it How and why did Rotwangs hightech laboratory manage to get constructed BENEATH that cottage without disturbing it?For modern viewers some of the plots incoherence can be blamed on missing footage particularly in American prints The distributors for this films original Stateside release commissioned playwright Channing Pollock to translate the German titles A major subplot of the backstory features a deceased woman named Hel who was married to Rotwang but left him to marry Fredersen and give birth to Freder This unseen womans name could not easily be changed for the American version due to a couple of shots of her memorial engraved with the Teutonic name HEL Apparently Pollock feared that American viewers would be offended by this words similarity to Hell so he simply excised the entire subplot from this long movieThe reallife drama on the set of Metropolis mustve been quite interesting in itself Mad scientist Rotwang alias Doctor Strangeglove is played by actor Rudolf KleinRogge who had been married to scenarist von Harbou before she left him to marry Fritz Lang the mastermind of this film In Metropolis Rotwangs wife left him to marry the master of Metropolis Id love to know how KleinRogge felt about the fact that his reallife marital and sexual situation was the inspiration for key plot elements of this movie  and I wonder how KleinRogge felt about knowing that the entire cast and crew knew this as wellMost astonishing about this gargantuan production is the fact that nearly all of Metropolis was actually built to scale with just a couple of miniaturesTrivia tidbit actress Brigitte Helm was cast in the dual female role largely because she was flatchested and therefore she could easily fit inside the mechanical suit for the Robotrix A more busty actress would have suffered constant discomfort inside those galvanised bosoms of the metal costume I learnt this more than  years ago from an eldery Austrian stagehand who worked on the filmFor all its flaws Metropolis will always be my favourite movie Ive enjoyed writing all these reviews for IMDb The joy of posting my reviews on this site has brought me many friendships and a few enemies Well you cant win em allNitrate film stock doesnt last forever and all good things come to a happy ending This is my last review here Ill keep watching movies but other passions are important to me as well Thank you IMDb and thank you to everyone who has read my reviews I will happily rate Metropolis a full  out of ,10
434,tt0017136,One definitely cant fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Langs vision even if as always with depictions of the future there are a few forgivable blind spots The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the s as are the flyingmachines that buzz about them; while the business dress of tomorrows rulers unlike their exotic leisure wear doesnt appear to have advanced one iota!HGWells criticised the film for its adherence to arty image over scientific rigour and as a piece of coherent science fiction its certainly as lacking as he claimed The machines exist to appear awesome and to torment their workers rather than to perform any apparent task and there is no explanation of how this society functions how it evolved or how it is sustained let alone of the incongruities that must surely lie behind such anomalous locations as the catacombs and the cathedral But Wells own futuristic film Things to Come conceived in direct riposte to Langs unscientific approach is tedious and talky as a result didactic in its heavyfooted philosophy and explanations and lacking in artistic vision Metropolis may be soft SF but its approach undoubtedly makes for better cinemaI am not however impressed by it as a film Masterpiece of Modernism it may be  but great design and special effects cant save todays bigbudget clunkers from deficiencies of character and plot and they dont save this one Ironically I suspect that its reputation has benefited greatly from its being the only silent film many of its viewers have ever encountered reading through the IMDb pages I see wellmeaning comments like Great  when you consider how primitive cinema was in  and once you get used to the fact that it takes about ten gestures to convey one sentence It wasnt  and it doesnt!As silent films go this is in many places agonizingly slow and repetitious marred by clumsy acting tendentious titles and overwrought gestures By the late s cinema had progressed far beyond this laboured pantomime in Langs case the heavy stylisation may have been a deliberate choice but compared to the fluidity of contemporaries such as Sjostroms The Wind or The Scarlet Letter Asquiths Underground or Shooting Stars and Murnaus Sunrise the film comes across as ten years behind the times The problem is not necessarily with the actors  Brigitte Helm as has been observed does an excellent job in differentiating her two characters  but with the direction and pacingWe saw the restored version with the original Gottfried Huppertz score; the latter didnt always seem to fit too well with pops jumps and awkward silences but this was I assume due either to the difficulty of fitting it to allow for the missing material or to problems in the projection booth when running a newlyarrived print for the first time However the painstaking summary of the various missing scenes only ended up increasing my appreciation of what a good job had been done in the editingdown in the first place! To take a single example where the edited version conveys Freders sudden recollection that he is supposed to be the workers longawaited mediator via the simple juxtaposition of three shots  the shiftchange whistle announcing the meeting the catacombs and Freder suddenly struck by an idea and rushing off  the restoration betrays the fact that a couple of scenes of mimed dialogue were originally provided to spell out the message at painstaking lengthIt is interesting to see how it was done but most of the cuts are either an improvement or a very clever abridgement and by and large I didnt feel that what was omitted had been any great loss In fact frankly I felt that the film was in need of further editing at certain points such as Rotwangs pursuit of Maria through the catacombs She screams and runs and screams and runs and is pursued by a searchlight effect; its clever selfconsciously clever the first couple of times but the repetition becomes tedious to the point of caricature Plot infelicities abound in increasing numbers culminating in the infamous Hunchback of Notre Damestyle ending where the mad scientist carries off the girl across the roof of the cathedral hotly pursued by Our Hero which raised giggles in a hitherto serious and respectful audience with which I couldnt help but sympathiseThis is a film to see once in a lifetime so that you can say that you have seen it  not least because most of the impact lies in the visuals But its all surface and no substance the characters act arbitrarily the plot is subservient to the Message the pacing is like treacle the storytelling technique is primitive and really all it has going for it is the visual flair and the special effects I quite honestly believe that this work would be better appreciated as a set of stills in a glossy brochure; an exhibit in a design exhibition This is not cinema as I love it  its innovative it may be Art but as an actual film its only a poor shadow,6
435,tt0017136,There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator This is the predominant theme of Metropolis and director Fritz Lang finds numerous ways to say and visualize his message during the course of the film The movie relies on repeated visual imagery to make its point and does so effectively even if tedious at times Particularly effective is the representation of the worker society as an almost single living unit moving trance like to their appointed time and task The use of a ten hour clock in the workers chamber constantly draws our attention as does the hangdog posture of the individual slaves who grind out their workday as if in a dazeAmid this rabble worker Maria Brigitte Helm is the inspirational voice of the workers offering hope for a brighter future by a mediator yet to appear However the Master of Metropolis John Frederson Alfred Abel sees in her a way to quell the underlying frustration of the workers commissioning his scientist Rotwang to create a robot Maria to plant discord among the workers Rotwangs laboratory would have done Frankenstein proud and the creation of the robot is a marvel of cinematic imagery The robot Marias belly dance transforms into a scene of such raw energy and sexual awareness that it awakens the statues of the Seven Deadly Sins one of the master strokes of this expressionist filmSo much imagery in fact is layered into Metropolis that its safe to say that repeat viewings will lead to even more interpretations of its vision and not simply for its denunciation of a class society Both timely and timeless the film captures a dynamism that inspires passion even after nearly eighty years following its original release,8
436,tt0017136,I really hate it when I dont enjoy a classic film I really want to enjoy it but I just cant I want to understand some peoples love for it but I just cant Metropolis falls under this category An unbearably slow film I watched the restoration which is over  hours longthat may have been a bad idea that starts off with interesting ideas but then seems to not really do much with them It is the year  the wealthy rule the city of Metropolis while the lowerclass work for hours on end underground in awful conditions The Master of Metropolis is Joh Fredersen Alfred Abel and his son is Freder Gustav Frohlich who spends his days with other rich people in a place called the pleasure garden where he truly does nothing at all A woman named Maria Brigitte Helm brings a group of working children up for a visit in pleasure garden and Freder is quickly enamored by Maria Freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shocked as an explosion goes off and kills multiple workers He reports this to his father who is disappointed his son was the first to report it over his assistant Josepha Theodor Loos and his assistant is quickly fired This does an immediate job of showing the coldness of Joh but they never do much else with his character In fact very little of the characters are developed in anyway Most of them are completely uninteresting and the setting itself is compelling at first but quickly loses anything interesting halfway through the film as the film moves at a snail pace Anyways the main aspect of the plot here is that the workers are led by Maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of a mediator to make it happen My real issue is that the film starts with such a great idea and had potential to become something like  Im aware it came out afterwords and that its a novel but still just an example but it instead becomes filled with strange religious allusions and becomes a witch hunt essentially by the end They never really do any decent social commentary at all If any at all This wouldnt matter if the film was actually entertaining but it only is in spurts and then quickly becomes a repetitive bore I do think the special effects were impressive and this film is obviously important for being the first full length science fiction filmwell ever That doesnt mean it holds up because it doesnt In fact itd be hard for me to believe the film was entertaining in  I still wonder if I had watched the shorter version of the film how much more I wouldve enjoyed the film It certainly wouldve have been paced better considering so much of this film is unbelievably uninteresting But I dont think that changes the fact that this movie doesnt really do anything It isnt entertaining It doesnt really have a message What is this movie? I guess good special effects for ? Whatever Im glad I gave this classic a chance but I highly doubt Ill revisit it anytime soon,4
437,tt0017136,This review contains Spoilers But since the story is by far the least reason to watch Metropolis feel free to still read it even if you havent watched it yetMetropolis is a film that was far ahead of its time It influenced a great lot of sciencefiction films and how The Blade Runner Batman or Dark City would look like if there wasnt Metropolis  who knows Even The Matrix Reloaded is heavily inspired by this classic that is as old as my grandmother Now what is it all about? About Freder the son of the head of the city of Metropolis a Christlike figure who falls in love with the preacher of the working class a saintlike woman who happens to be named Maria When a robot who is modeled to look like Maria makes the workers almost extinguish their city and their children Maria and Freder save the children and in the end Freder makes his father and the workers cooperate for a brighter futureSounds silly to you? Yes and thats exactly what the story is silly Thats also the reason why still today Metropolis isnt accepted as the masterpiece it is by a few film buffs But these people dont understand one thing A good film does more than only tell a story A film can be great even without a story at all and a silly story combined with amazing visuals can make you forget all the other weaknesses a film has And wow what amazing images Metropolis offers What an art direction! What wonderful special effects! And remember as I already said this film is as old as my grandmother! Just have a look at the workers They hardly ever seem to be individuals In the mass scenes they look like one big creature moving forward or backwards When they are working they look more like machines than like human beings whereas the machines resemble monsters more than they do technical devices best seen in the moments when Freder hallucinates and sees the big machine as a workereating Moloch We also see a worker and later Freder work on a machine that looks like a clock with  blinking light bulbs doing some that looks as exhausting as it looks senseless Or think of Rotwang the mad inventor who lives in a little hut that looks in this film like it was from another world He has a black prosthesis for his right hand its not a coincidence that Stanley Kubrick gave his mad scientist/inventor Dr Strangelove a prosthesis for his right hand too He builds the robot that he makes to look like Maria and that transformation scene is one of the most magnificent scenes ever and looks more convincing than some scenes of modern scifi flicks I also have to mention Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and the robot  and the look in her eyes would already be enough to tell which of her characters is on screen at the moment If something like awards already would have been given in the s she sure would have walked home with quite a bunch of them And just look at her sexy dance! It is just as memorable as the shot of the many eyes watching her dance  or the many faces watching her preach just a few minutes later Metropolis is a film no scififan should miss I had the good luck that my first viewing of Metropolis one year ago was in a cinema when it was a rereleased after its restoration I can only recommend you to watch it in a cinema if you have the possibility to as Metropolis is just as   A Space Odyssey one of those rare films that are masterpieces on your TV set but a revelation on the big screen,10
438,tt0017136,I was very anxious to see Metropolis for the first time I had been into silent movies for a couple of years but hadnt had the opportunity to see Fritz Langs classic I finally saw it at a silent movie theater in Hollywood and my feelings were to say the least mixedThe film is visually stunning Monumental sets brilliantly directed scenes amazing special effects by the standards of the time In fact I might say that I was more enthralled by the visual effects of this movie than I was by say Lord of the Rings or Avatar Whereas Cameron and Jackson used CGI to make their visions come true; Lang had to use camera trickery paint and woodThis movie no doubt set the lexicon for the SciFi and blockbuster genre in stone The images of Metropolis have been repeated in innumerable movies The scene of the underground city being flooded has curious similarities to James Camerons Titanic Even the villainous Rotwang can be seen in the characters Dr Strangelove and Doc Brown from Back to the FutureBut then theres the story And the dialogue And the acting which is overwrought even by the standards of the time But I dont have enough room to go into thatStarting with the opening line LookThese are your brothers a violent cringe would run through my body every time the intertitles would appearThe later line about the head and hands needing the heart as mediator caused a huge outburst of laughter in the theater This serves as the basis for the moral of the story which was eerily similar to How the Grinch Stole Christmas Essentially it can boiled down to this Somebody according to writer Thea von Harbous later beliefs this turned out to be Adolf Hitler needs to appeal to the hearts of capitalist managers and tell them to be nice to their workers The outcome is a grudging handshake between the head manager Joh Frederson and the leader of the workers Grot; and thus begins a shining new day!Metropolis also incorporates religious symbolism which is to say the very least heavyhanded Scenes of the Seven Deadly Sins The Tower of Babel an altar to Moloch and the Flood all warn of doom to decadent societies that exploit the weak and kill the righteousIn the end this muddled mixture of Socialist calls for justice and Christian Apocalypticism creates a political message that Lang himself described as sillyI recommend this film for its artistic brilliance and groundbreaking techniques But dont go into this expecting an award quality filmIf you want to get into silent film this is a relatively easy one to get start with However I dont know if thats a good or a bad thing Ive met too many people whove said that Metropolis was the best silent movie theyve ever seen; which probably means that it was the only one that they ever bothered to watch I would recommend Sunrise or City Lights as a first over this,5
439,tt0017136,Francis Ford Coppola once said that Apocalypse Now wasnt just about Vietnam is was Vietnam In a similar way Metropolis isnt just about the Twentieth Century it is the Twentieth Century Almost every image in it reflects or more often predicts the realities of life in the West over the past hundred years in a way that is truly uncannyFrom small details  the traffic jams and blackouts that plague city dwellers  to major historical events  the climactic flood predicts every industrial disaster that has destroyed the lives of thousands of workers from Chernobyl to the Bhopal disaster whilst Fredersens vision of workers being fed to Moloch cant help but bring to mind the holocaust  Metropolis feels prescient in any number of ways In the image of the Manhattan skyline Lang really did find the perfect symbol of the coming century  progressive new faceless oppressiveThis is far from the simple Marxist fable it is often taken for  although the Socialist message can hardly be ignored Its also a Christian parable Maria flanked by crosses is counterbalanced by the Machine brought to life under a pentagram informed by the book of Revelation; a retelling of the Orpheus myth with Freder as Orpheus and Maria as Eurydice lost in the underworld; and a Kafkaesque nightmare of depersonalisation although the Gothic expressionistic production design is a long way from Kafkas more sterile styleIts also lest we forget a silly adventuremelodrama with a mad scientist an evil twin a bad father with a noble son and an impossibly virtuous idealised heroine In many ways it anticipates Star Wars in dressing up mythic standards with Science Fiction tropes  with Fredersen as the misguided King Freder as the handsome Prince Maria the goodhearted peasants daughter Rotwang as a scheming sorcerer and the Machine as the wicked witch appropriately burnt at the stake by the villagersThe MachineMan a confusing name for a construction so obviously feminine is the single most indelible image of the film; the scene in which Rotwang brings her to life for the first time is a real moment of magic and awe untarnished by eighty subsequent years of cinematic showmanship Even better is the scene in which she becomes a duplicate of Maria  such an obvious influence on James Whales Frankenstein that its hard not to shout out Its alive! The optical effects are years ahead of their time certainly the best of their kind until the sixties at least It also marks the beginning of Brigitte Helms truly extraordinary turn as the false MariaThis is only the third silent film Ive seen after Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and its taken me a while to acclimatise to the acting style which can seem close to parody What it really reminds me of however is modern dance which similarly seeks to communicate with the audience visually rather than verbally Metropolis encourages this comparison with the highly choreographed movements of the workers operating the machinery Bearing this in mind Helm is hugely impressive in multiple roles Maria could be a rather dull and virtuous heroine she enters the film surrounded by poor children in rags but Helm invests her with enormous energy and expressiveness It helps that the script allows her to take an unusually proactive role for a female character organising workers meetings and racing to the rescue of the endangered children However it is her performance as bad Maria vamping up a storm that lingers in the memory  the twitching jerking movements of her head and body the Anne Robinson style halfwink that changes the shape of her face that malicious little grin that makes it hard not to root for her mischief The entirely weird erotic dance that she performs isnt technically very good or erotic but it is utterly unforgettable Subtextually shes the Whore of BabylonThe other performances are mainly very good particularly Alfred Abel as Fredersen proving that it is possible to underplay in a silent film Only Rudolf KleinRogge hits any wrong notes  difficult as it undoubtedly must be to play a mad scientist in a silent film with subtlety some of his more unrestrained gesticulations leave you worried about the safety of the other actorsUltimately though it all inevitably comes back to the imagery Langs film remains unmatched even today Pick a scene any scene  the synchronised shuffling crowds at the shift change; our first sighting of the Metropolis all biplanes skyscrapers and suspended motorways; the vision of Moloch; the MachineMan awakening; Maria pursued along a pitchblack tunnel by a beam of light; the statue of Death coming to life in the Cathedral; disembodied eyes entranced by the twitching false Maria; the crowds swarming up the steps in the Tower of Babel section; the lifts crashing down one by one; desperate children crowding around Maria as the floodwaters close in; and most of all false Maria laughing as she burns on her pyre then transforming back to her metal visage No film before or since matches this for spectacle And if in order to appreciate it you have to swallow a little treacle about the heart being the mediator between head and hands well trust me its worth it,9
440,tt0017136,We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Langs Metropolis are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upperclass and operated by slavelike poor The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan These elements can be found in this films ancestors Frankenstein Batman Gattaca and the cities of Blade Runner Star Wars and The Fifth Element All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Langs workMetropolis has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes After its success in  the film has had an uneasy time Its pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in  Unless a lost version surfaces as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentinos  film Beyond the Rocks the complete work my never be seen again The restored version released on DVD in  was based on a digital restoration at K resolution from all available sources Its the best version that Ive seen and I would highly recommend that one if you havent seen the film The worst is a  print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration the film in grainy and difficult to see it doesnt even have a soundtrack I call that one the worst because Im still a little ambivalent about the  restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting good sound effects not so good and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy Freddy Mercury Bonnie Tyler Adam Ant and Pat Benatar yuck!Those who study the film myself included find the story impenetrable Some films you can easily decipher but Metropolis has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that its hard to pin it down as a whole Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the films chaotic nature It takes place in the future restored versions offer title cards that suggest that its the year  but I dont go by that in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers the Gothic sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives dancing in their penthouses and spending their money The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step They dont so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses slaves building his pyramids The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another One person that isnt ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his officeHis son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the workers children Curious he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there The woman is Maria a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be foundFreder uncovers a plot by Rotwang the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms This leads to the films most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzyThen all Hell breaks loose but the rest I must leave to you to discoverLang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film and therefore less successful the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers At one point Freder disguised as a worker witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen Another suggests an odd device a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around its edge The machine doesnt seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless dayThe film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism astonishing in its use of light and shadow One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in Another brilliant moment comes with Marias erotic dance as the men gawk the camera filled with their moist eyes This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home videoOther moments have deeper resonance There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves Walking to work they march with their heads down dressed in uniforms and caps It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler More obvious are Langs biblical references The rise of the city parallels Marias retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel The giant pentagram in Rotwangs lab as he plays God The breathtaking image of the plaguebringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself There is even a Christlike quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakersThese elements and images are brought to the film because of Langs insistence on no less then absolute perfection He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster working his cast and crew like a dictator He cast some  extras  of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone and worked them from morning till night The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with himI could go on and on this film all great films invite lengthy discussions It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over But when you get down to it the best way to view Metropolis is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of its time Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad,0
441,tt0017136,This truly is a classic masterpiece and honestly one of the best movies ever made The story is brilliant and the visuals amazingI have seen the German  minutes version of the movie without subtitles Yes its a long watch but its worth every second of it Basically only reason why the movie is so long is because they need about ten hand gestures to speak one sentence Its kind of dreadful to look at first but once youre used to it it shouldnt trouble you anymoreIn many ways this movie can be regarded as the Blade Runner of the s Metropolis is set in a futuristic world that has a same kind of atmosphere as in Blade Runner The mix of s cars and propellerplanes with futuristic machines highways buildings and androids is very unusual but an absolutely awesome thing to look at The movie was ahead of its time and in some ways also propheticThe story is absolutely the best thing of the movie Also the way the story is told and directed by Fritz Lang deserves credit The story is tense and has quite some symbolism layers and storylines but remains always easy to follow The ending is truly spectacular and tense The way how spectacular and tense the ending and the entire movie in general was really surprised me in a positive wayThe sets are obviously fake and miniatures at times but they still manage to convince and impress Further more the movie is filled with some fantastic and very convincing early special effectsMan who also deserves credit is Alfred Abel Wow what a great actor he was in this movieAn absolute must see and one of the best movies of all time/http//bobafettblogspotcom/,10
442,tt0017136,MetropolisMetropolis is one of the most exciting and exceptional works of art that humankind has produced This epic science fiction film is one of Germanys famous silent movies created by Fritz Lang and liberated in  the period between the two World WarsThis movie represents the expressionist cinema and shows us the repression of human needs by the machine age Langs creation of a selfdestructive society is a protest against the machine age Metropolis is one of the most magnificent cities of  is kept alive by the unceasing work of the underground people who live in slavery and is enjoyed by wealthy and educated people The Austrian director of the movie Fritz Lang presents the story of a master John Federsen who sees people as machines working constantly to maintain the luxury and technology of his metropolis On the other side his son Freder falls in love with one of the underground workers who is a spiritual leader for the slaves The son recognizes the unsentimental heart of his father and starts a revolution The city gets flooded and Maria Freders love regains the workers trust after a robot had stolen her identity she finds her loved one after saving the citys children and the workers shake hands with the masterExpressionism tries to simplify the world and to understand it emotionally in a subjective way It is very important to understand this definition of this dynamic violent and distorted movement in order to understand that Lang tried to externalize his own internal vision of the world through simple expressions The name metropolis comes from the Greeks and means mothercity It has this significance because a metropolis is the biggest form of a technologically and economically developed city Nevertheless referring to the movie name this film can be considered as the mother city of all cinematic clichés In this story there are two main characters Maria and Freder These two characters are also the heroes of the story because they are the ones who rescue the population from being drowned in the flood John Federson is a person full of empowering feelings who only thinks of himself and of his city forgetting about the ones who work for him All the fantasies that he has come true through the power of his workers but he never thinks about the danger they are in while working for him This man wants so much power that he is almost hypnotized by it; he is obsessed and possessed by the power of inventions and creationsOn the other hand Maria is just a symbol of munificence her soul is pure and she is seen like an angel who brings peace to the world Maria convoys the people in a church settling area She is shown as sanctity a holy person that is surrounded by the light of the candles She is positioned higher than the workers who carefully listen to her as she speaks about peace unity and their salvation by a mediator that will soon come Her eyes inspire confidence and kindness as she kisses Freder in the church scene In general all she does is for the good of humanity One thing that she repeats in the movie is Between the head and hands there must be a heart  This means that she realizes the bad things that the head John Frederson does and the good things that the hands workers do But she knows that these workers should not be treated poorly or like robots and that she can be the heart which can persuade the head and the hands to cooperate to come to common interests Maria as her name suggests is also a biblical motif She explains to the workers the story of the Tower of Babel The workers in the story destroy this tower which parallels how the movie will end with the destruction of the machines by the workforce Maria is still the representation of Jesus mother because she is trying to save the lives of the underground children She would sacrifice herself and alike Mother Mary she has a strong faith in the creator of the world All the scenes of this film are perfectly created at the eye level so that anyone is able to view the action However there is also a birds eye view at the beginning of the movie as the panorama of the city is shown from high above the ground This view was created to give us an impression of how widely extended and huge Metropolis is In addition the focus of the dramatic camera angles with bold shadows is on the disproportioned landscape as well as on the rightangled buildings There are moments in which the camera focuses on fast movement scenes like the dancing of the robot in the nightclub and scenes where it focuses on slow movement like in the beginning of the film where the slaves are shown going into the working area at a certain pace and aligned as robots When more people are involved in a scene like the one in which all the children are surrounding Maria as she rings the danger bell the angles are vertical triangular but when only one person is focused there is a closeup to allow us to read that characters expressions and feelings A good example would be the closeups on the master Fredersons eyes as he asks his secretary why his son was allowed to go underground and as well after that scene when he is thinking in order to suggest this dictators meditation and frustration Another important aspect of the camera and of Expressionism that I have remarked was the scene in which the mad scientist tries to run away from Freder and kidnaps Maria He is walking up on the roof of a sharpangled building holding Maria under his arm as if nothing would happen The same scene was notable in Robert Wienes film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari as Cesare walks up on the roof with the kidnapped fiancé and the city crowd follows himTime also is significant in the film because the clock keeps showing up in the most important scenes Time is evident in Fredersons office as his son challenges him to have mercy for the people as well as he is talking to his secretary Still only a small portion of the clock is shown in these shots and it means the time in which the master can think what decisions to take On the other hand a gigantic clock is shown as Freder finds an exhausted worker trying to turn a wallclock Freder understands the struggle of this man and replaces him There is where he finds out that at  pm Maria will have a meetingBut all that we have seen in this movie is not only made to show us the great importance of this silent SF film that can keep the watcher alive by its impressive music and can inspire contemporary movies like Matrix  but for its great historical importance Fritz Lang expressed a social life in this movie as well as a political one After WWI when Germany had lost a war peoples lives were a disaster Everyone was disoriented and could not keep up with the tragedy that was going on and maybe there were some influences of the great antiSemitism that was supposed to follow But Germany was a great disaster as well and there was nothing it could have done to prevent it because many troubles kept adding up over the years and this country had to be defeated morally and politically as well as economically Even if Germanys wish of reconstruction was as utopic as Fredersens wish of a technological city the postwar inflation had a big contribution on cinemas development,0
443,tt0017136,I typically dont like silent films but I decided to watch this one for two reasons  First I usually like scifi movies and second Metropolis had received so many glowing reviews that I couldnt pass it up  However my opinion of this film is below what most reviewers have been sayingKinos digitally remastered version on DVD is very impressive  The sound and picture quality are both excellent  However I have to conclude that favorable reviews of this film are likely based on nostalgia on the films influence on future films and on the incredible visual effects given its year of release  Film history buffs and silent film fans should see this movie  I thought this was a good film but not a great one  A rating of  is much too high and at # there are plenty of better films ranked below itFirst the good parts of the film  The special effects are excellent for a pres film  The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work the decisions they make and in how easily they are led/misled  The main character is well developed throughout the film and the audience can relate to him well  The film is visually stunning and impressive  The story of the working class vision of the future machinemen etc have had a very strong influence on many films which came later,4
444,tt0017136,For its time this movie has stunning visuals kind of Kubrickesqe in appearance especially the opening scenes of workers going and coming from work Its very strange with the group leaving walking with their heads down like zombiesThe set designs in here are also something that might draw your attention This really has a futuristic look I thought the visuals were fascinating This was German expressionist filmwork at its height I would think Director Fritz Lang went on to become a very famous man in his profession This wasnt his first effort but I think this might have been the film that put him on the map so to speak Several years later he gained a lot more fame with M At any rate with the photography sets and overall Flash Gordontype scifi look this must have been a real eyeopener to movies viewers  years ago I still think they look very cool today The music was also very dramatic at least in this restored  surround sound restoration DVD put out by KlinoObviously the eye makeup on men and the exaggerated motions by actors in silent films look a little hokey but I was mesmerized by Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and her evil clone She is something else! I also appreciated Klinos explanation of lost footage and how they did the best they could do to still make the story flow together They did an outstanding job I wouldnt attempt to watch this on anything less than this DVD which looks pretty darn goodThis is a worker story about a man wanting to trade his comfortable life to join the oppressed workers who do their thing beneath the earth in Metropolis Workers are seen as nothing but replaceable robots If someone gets hurt they get carted away and replaced immediately but some other zombielike human Of course people being mistreated can only take it for so long before rebellion Thats history from the days of the Jewish slaves in Egypt to today so thats part of this story too I wont say more to ruin itI dont want to mislead people on one major point todays audiences watching this Few people in  watch silent movies To ask them to sit through two hours of a silent film is obviously asking a lot I had to break this up into several viewings myself but thats okay I still enjoyed itbut it a silent movie this long is not easy to sit through You have to be a student of film or a big film buff to watch thisbut those people will be rewarded Over  reviews in here show you this film has enough to offer or at least take a look Now that this restored version is available check it out!,7
445,tt0017136,OK first of all Im not some kind of actionjunkie who thinks that the Rambotrilogy is the best movies of all time I am a person who think that other silents like Nosferatu and The Battleship Potemkin are entertainingAlthough I loved the previous movies referred to I thought this was one of the most dull movies ever As entertainment this movie cant go very far On a scale rating its abilities to entertain it gets a / from meAs a milestone in the history of movies it goes all the way to the top The special effects were great to have been made almost  years ago The editing was great It must have been one of the most expensive movie made to that date On the scale of how important a chapter in the cinematic history this is I will rate it a / That means a total / This also means that you should rather check out really good silents like Chaplins Modern Times Eisensteins The Battleship Potemkin and Murnaus Nosferatu,8
446,tt0017136,Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium and his  opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format a fully restored print on the KINO DVD filled with intertitles to keep the story complete that had me appreciate it more but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music ie Giorgio Moroders experimental cut it would still be affecting At the core of the story Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou the sides of good vs evil or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak is set up so strongly that even when it has its fairytale type of heaviness to it it doesnt seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults This is the kind of film that should work for anyone young and old as it deals with universal themes ie The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!The story leaves room for the visual style to come through Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis Joh Frederson He feels the sorrow and pain of the people and goes down to their level to be one of them He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women Maria played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm in multiple roles she plays without a fault who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freders father Enter the robot a marvel of a mad scientist who gets transposed from Maria and becomes the havocwrecker of the part of Metropolis I wont reveal too much of the story except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lapAmidst in all of this Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects cameratricks and of course editing if I wouldnt quite rank Metropolis in my alltime top ten favorites I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day cars moving on roads built to the sky airplanes flying everywhich way and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways But its not just the use of the models or the sets or the backdrops or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Langs shots which are all spectacular its also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene it also appears in other scenes I think Its little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages the superimpositions of faces and eyes in the dreamlike shotsAnd of course Langs greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story he goes beyond his time period in stylizing As I mentioned with the pacing being unique it was surprising though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M that many of the suspense sequences mob scenes/riots chases I knew that this is the same kind of styling thats used today for many of the most modern of sciencefiction/action films In its own way much like Stanley Kubricks  Space Oddysey it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling while not completely abandoning the storytelling form Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries and it hasnt been seen in its full form in almost eighty years what remains doesnt seem at all dated or crude Quite the opposite its visual expressiveness its use of time and character and action and its deliberate pacing makes it ahead of its time and influential and at the same time keeping itself unique Its a tale were all familiar with being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial cruel world which Im sure was even more relevant to post WW Germany at the time filmed with a mix of overthetop melodrama megabudget setpieces and designs that confound the senses Add the appropriate music and youve got a classic fantasy A tremendous film to see two three a dozen times over though some of those too impatient for films without spoken words or by the operatic dramatic side of it all may become disappointed or frustrated,10
447,tt0017136,For many years the initially flopped and consequently butchered Metropolis Fritz Lang made in the mid twenties of the past century could be appreciated at least for its qualities as the indispensable sciencefiction trailblazer in motion picture history What was severely lacking from the plot however finally emerged on screen again after the famous Buenos Aires reel find which brought a quarter of what was missing from the film back from the dead With the new painstaking  restoration effort also came a grandiose symphony orchestra studio recording of the original Gottfried Huppertz score  and the results make movie buffs prone to be blown away and this time for realThe technical brilliance and visual lavishness of Fritz Langs oeuvre was always undisputed already at its time and only matched by fellow German Murnaus ingenious approaches on filmmaking Theres so much and dense imagery that generations of future filmmakers would draw from this newly emerging archetype Among the unforgettable scenes are the giant heart machine which turns into a moloch in one of the heros visions the Babel tower teeming with utopian life the enormous sets elevators and masses and masses of enslaved and rebellious people the staggering creation of the first robot all set against the dominant dichotomy between  literally  those living above and those dying below There are echoes of communism here of nazi ideology of the dangers and abysses of industrialization technology and there are also glimpses of humanity Not perfect in all its components the film nevertheless has everything pioneering in it  and more Fritz Lang while having some reservations himself referred to the picture as a signpost for new destinations and thats exactly what it became now that we can look at the great scifi pictures of the past century In them and through them Metropolis still lives and once we revisit the original again we might yet be surprised that it miraculously still points ahead,10
448,tt0017925,Probably Buster Keatons best film and oddly enough its not even a straightforward comedy  its actually an action film with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure  `The General which is set during the Civil War is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray Buster Keaton of course who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army    and is turned down because the army feels hed be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier  However through a series of misunderstandings both Johnnys family and his girl think hes a coward and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier  Months pass and Johnny sad and alone is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North  Johnnys efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girls love  become an unbelievably funny and actionpacked series of events as Johnny tries to go from being a sadsack buffoon to being a heroIf you havent watched many silent films they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive as hes fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye  While funny Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well  His timing whether for a joke or for a tender moment is absolutely impeccableWhats also great about `The General is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldnt be made today  No amount of insurance would cover it  Keaton does all his own stunts and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General with a bike he sits on a moving cattlecatcher knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own  All these stunts are fantastic but its scary to think that any one of these probably couldve killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong  ,9
449,tt0017925,Buster Keaton once said that if he hadnt been a comedian he might have been a civil engineer He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics Its no wonder he adored trains the most elegant of machines and brought them into his movies whenever he could When one of Keatons former gagwriters loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this page of history to life His first certainty was that the production had to be so authentic it hurts He even insisted on using historically accurate narrowgauge railroad tracks which he found along with appropriate landscapes near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove OregonMost importantly the area had stretches of parallel tracks which allowed scenes of Buster on his trainagilely scrambling over the cars balancing on the roof to scan the horizon chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind himto be filmed from another train running alongside Buster his train and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Busters hair while smoky pinecovered hills rise and fall around him These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures and they put to shame all later backprojection and process shots models and computergenerated effects The quality of Keatons filmmaking is simplypun intendedunparalleled Every shot in The General is clean fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times The film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional just like the grave masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniformsThe Generals narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look Like a train it stays on track never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline Adapting the historical incident Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train Johnnie Gray rather than one of the raiders As he saw immediately The General is one long chase or rather two chases structured like the flight of a boomerang First Johnnie on a borrowed train the Texas chases his own stolen train the General He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines pursued by the raiders in the Texas who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high commandThe General is not Keatons funniest film but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs A number of the gags like the boxcar that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks have a long buildup for a relatively modest payoff But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings The cannon attached to the back of Busters train goes off just as the train starts around a curve so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders train coming out of the curve Riding on the cowcatcher Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his trains wheels so lost in thought he doesnt notice when the train starts to move carrying him up and down in gentle arcs stillness in motionI agree with author Jim Kline who describes The General as Keatons most personal film the one that best captures his unique vision spirit and personality In many of his films Buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero But his competent ingenious and athletic character in The General who is also modest tireless and underestimated comes much closer to his real nature There is a shot in The General of Busters eye isolated on screen framed by a hole in a white tablecloth that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertovs kinoglaz the cameraeye Keaton melds with his camera; theres no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies They have the same silence the same strictness the same strange blend of gravity and humorThe General might be the most serious comedy every made but its not a tragicomedy That as in Chaplins blending of pathos and low humor was something people took to immediately But no one knew what to make of The General Original reviews accused the film of being dull pretentious unoriginal and unfunny Even today people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing The General is challenging because it doesnt flaunt its virtues; like Keatons concise and economical performance it holds a great deal in reserve Take the movies most famous shot of a train crashing through a burning bridge for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film he doesnt dwell on it or hype it Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience never manipulates never overplays He doesnt show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents nor does he play for sympathy Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold But for those who can see the expressiveness of Busters socalled stone face who get his peculiar dry humor who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated Buster Keaton always has more than hes showing; you can see it in his eyes,10
450,tt0017925,It is generally or should I pun and say General Lee? said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keatons career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past but getting the correct rolling stock costumes weapons and props to make it look correct And it worked so well that Keaton never really could despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR outdo it In fact the closest thing to his best sound film or film that he influenced that was a sound film was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE where he returned to a Civil War themeTHE GENERAL as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE is based on the Andrews Raiders stealing of the Confederate locomotive The General and an attached train which was used to damage tracks and bridges The raid in February  was from northern Georgia into Tennesee It only lasted  miles as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial Others went to southern prisoner of war camps The effect of the incident far outstripped its military success The damage after all could be repaired But like Jimmy Doolittles Raid over Tokyo in April  it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky/Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhileDespite it being a brief incident of the war the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south When Lesney did it famous series of Models of Yesteryear the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was The GeneralThe story however was ultimately a downer But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period First he changes the viewers perspective  it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men but on the Confederates Secondly he builds up the story of Johnny Gray a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier Because Keatons family and girl friend Marion Mack see he is not enlisted they believe he turned cowardJohnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake the General from the raiders and the film has actually two chases in it  first Andrews and his men stealing the train and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking itAlong the way are many comic classic moments such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train or when at a moment of dejection Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase and finding Marion Mack there helping him are wonderful  especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired she throws away the ugly little ones Keatons reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful momentThe classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river and the burning of the railroad bridge with its destruction of a second locomotive It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history By the way the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest He was Mike Turkey Strut Donlin a frequent member and starring player of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the th Century Donlin who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases left baseball to become a film actor he had worked a bit in vaudeville Keaton was a sports fan and showed this in his film COLLEGE where he shows his abilities in several sports and hired Donlin This was the latters most famous performance  look at his reaction to the collapseIt must be regarded as Keatons finest film and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures,10
451,tt0017925,No one will top Keaton for physical risk and risk is what deep film experiences are all about This might be classed as a comedy but for me it touches deeply enough Its about a man who needs to prove himself by taking risks and being true And its by a man who takes even greater risks and is more true True to the spirit of the social compact here displayed as the chummy southHes always done stunts that amaze Many of his other films have things in them that if the timing were only a little off hed be seriously injured or die But this takes the cake Its almost as if he started with the idea that hed have three locos to play with and had a year to think up stunts And the stunts are so physical! And so dangerous And so so very effective His trademark is the deadpan face placed as a sort of innocent cluelessness Its particularly funny when you see the physical movements and you know that  they take incredible preparation and timing to pull off and  the fellow you see that looks so puzzled by the reality you see is the guy that devised and directed those stuntsTeds Evaluation   of  Worth watching,0
452,tt0017925,I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number # on the  version of AFIs Top  Movies of all time list It didnt make the cut at all for the original compilation in  so even before seeing the picture I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion I usually line up with the majority in most cases but I have to admit I dont quite get it with this picture I found it entertaining enough on occasion but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way its heralded on the DVD sleeve I dont think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy so right there my expectations were greatly reduced Keatons somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition dont help On the flip side I wouldnt have expected slapstick to move the story along either so at least I wasnt disappointed in that regardWhat I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity When Johnnie Gray Keaton dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army and pondered his situation while sitting on the trains connecting rod the resulting visual was pure genius The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnies thoughtful reverie and was one of the highlights of the picture for meThe other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge For starters I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb  unbelievableOh yes and I cant forget the sequence where Keatons marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a preCGI world its difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own For that Keaton deserves accoladesIn between all this clever film making however I just wasnt inspired The central plot element doesnt hold up for me  if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer why wasnt he simply told the reason why One could argue that then you wouldnt have a picture but for me it left the story on a shaky footing If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier the picture might have taken a different approach but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero Maybe Im second guessing a master but thats what I come away withConclusion  if this movie didnt make AFIs Top  Film List in  I dont understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top  At the same time Chaplins City Lights in my estimation a superior silent film fell OFF the list while The Gold Rush moved up a few notches I may not be a professional but I know what I like and this one just didnt do it for me,7
453,tt0017925,Buster Keatons The General about a man and his engine puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen From major comic situations to throwaway gags The General always knows what to doThe story begins in leisurely fashion A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray Keaton has two loves in his life his engine and his girlrespectively The General and Annabelle Lee Marion Mack Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle followed by two engineerworshipping boys and unknown to him Annabelle Lee herself He and his entourage arrive at the door; Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs slicks back his hair and gently taps the door with the door knocker Then he turns to notice Annabelle Keatons understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness Any other comedian would have done an explosive doubletakeNow Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor but the boys are there too Johnnie stands up puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave The heroworshippers are ready to follow but Johnnie lets them out first then closes the door on them This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pantsNow the two are alone Annabelles father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon the War Between the States has begun Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist then turns expectantly to Johnnie who cocks his head like a confused puppy She asks Arent you going to enlist? Realization hits him and he leaps off the seat Before he can run out the door Annabelle kisses him This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porchJohnnie races to the general store which is now a makeshift recruitment office Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation but the man rejects him Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer Later Annabelle believes that Johnnie didnt even try to enlist She refuses to speak to him again until hes in uniform What follows is a classic moment Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine Hes so miserable that he doesnt notice when he starts moving up and down until just before the train enters a tunnelTime passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General When nearly everyone is off the train having dinner the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine Annabelle a passenger herself was still on board She is now their prisonerBut Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen possibly by deserters He pursues the engine by taking another The Texas Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas but the Unionists think theyre outnumbered and continue to run What follows is the true joy of the movie two long chases separated by an important plot twist Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop actionI love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas At one point the car which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track reappears in front of the baffled engineer only to disappear later just as mysteriously We see the logical circumstances that lead to the cars seeming magic act and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied preventing him from seeing what we seeComic logic is important to The General In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable In a throwaway gag Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for itWe move to the second chase where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle LeeMarion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was She has hilarious moments The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire She takes a small stick and daintily puts it in Johnnie sarcastically hands her a sliver and she puts that in too Then in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping Johnnie grabs her and halfthrottles her before kissing her insteadThe final section most of it a battle scene includes the shot where The Texas begins to cross a burning bridge only to crash into the river Owing to Keatons disdain of fakery one of several reasons his works seem modern he did not use a model but a real train on a real burning bridge The crash cost $reportedly making it the single most expensive shot ever in a silent filmA worthy closing gag was too taxing even for Keatons ingenuity Johnnies dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers His remedy is only mildly funny Is anyone complaining? The General is a work of art and a work of genius,0
454,tt0017925,This film flopped when it was released in late  for several reasons First its premiere was delayed because Flesh and the Devil was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks Second people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian not Buster the filmmaker and director which is more of the role he played here The film was funny but it was not gag after gag like so many of Keatons other films Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South A title card declares he has two loves  his girl and his engine when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession His girlfriend misunderstands thinks him a coward and says she wont speak to him again until he is in uniformMeanwhile the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Busters train Unknown to Buster his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train still without the knowledge of his girls captivity by the Union armyForgotten with the arrival of sound the film revived  often cut up from its original length  in the s because Buster didnt preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today often with poor video and hideous musical accompanimentToday The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too SHERLOCK JR is clever OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious The General is both of these things Its story driven races to a climax and is fueled by cute clever inventive gagsBuster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in A Southern Yankee,9
455,tt0017925,One of the great masterpieces of cinema Buster Keatons The General combines inventive humor with terrific action and fine melodrama all beautifully and carefully planned and photographed  It is filled with subtle and wonderful details that make it well worth devoting your full attention to watching  As an extra bonus it offers a fascinating look at the Civil War era with many realistic details inspired by a historical incidentAfter a short opening sequence the movie divides nicely into two halves Johnny Keaton is a railway engineer turned down in his attempts to enlist in the Confederate Army and subsequently rejected by his girl  Continuing with the railroad one day his locomotive is stolen by Union spies who also kidnap his girl  Johnny first chases the engine into Union territory to recapture it and then is himself chased by the Northern Army as he attempts to return home  Both chases are filled with excitement and manic fun with some breathtaking stunts by Keaton thrown in  It all leads up to a dramatic and memorable climax that includes many ironic and suggestive touchesKeaton is at his best with the story offering him a perfect showcase for his many talents  His slapstick and acrobatic skills are given free rein and his characters stoic perseverance is a fine complement to the frantic actionThis belongs near the top of any list of great films a classic worth watching and rewatching,0
456,tt0017925,I havent had so much fun watching a movie for a long time The General is a silent comedy mostly slapstick about Johnny Gray a train engineer with two loves his engine and Annabelle Lee Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer Things are then sped up a year where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan As it so happens they steal Johnnys engine a big mistakeBuster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies but of course less old He is often ignorant of what is going on around him leading to plenty of laughs This also makes him a very charismatic characterThere are countless train related jokes The first one comes right at the beginning when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman in a line much like a train The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment The finale is explosiveThe General was a lot of fun to watch It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies and had plenty of substance on top of that This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever After my first viewing it instantly became one of my favorites It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies,10
457,tt0017925,THE GENERAL represents the greatest achievement screen comedy ever accomplished From the brilliant gag construction to the sheer excellence of the filmmaking technique THE GENERAL is a hilarious and amazing journey into comedy Written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman Keaton brings brilliant gags into the story The film begins when Keaton is told he is of no use to the South as a soldier but as a train engineer However his girlfriend refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform After the war has started the girl is kidnapped by some Union raiders on Keatons train and so begins the greatest and funniest chase ever filmed For the next  minutes the viewer is in Keatons world His gags routines and amazing slapstick serve to make this the greatest screen comedy ever filmedMatt age ,0
458,tt0017925,Ive seen one other silent movie in my life but it was Mel Brookss The Silent Movie so I dont know if it really counts I really enjoyed The General overall more than I thought I would as someone who was born after The GodfatherThe main thing that surprised me was the fact that I couldnt look down to write very many notes; any time I took my eyes off the screen I ran a serious risk of missing something It seems to me that the film even though it was long or seemed so it was very dense in terms of action I imagine that since the movie has no dialogue the filmmakers must make up for it by making it as visually interesting and entertaining as possible I am accustomed to more modern movies with snappy dialogue and special effects and suchmovies in which you can look down at your popcorn or kiss your date and not miss too much because you can hear pretty much whats happening This was a nice change for meObviously Ive never seen a Buster Keaton film and Im not even sure if Id heard of him before this class But I can see why he is so appealing in his films I loved his facial expressions particularly the stoicbutcrestfallen look in his eyes on the train when something else goes wrong He also has great control of his body as we discussed in class and a fine sense of comic timingI found the film surprisingly funny Many modern films that I think are funny eg Austin Powers Toy Story American Beauty rely largely on witty or outrageous dialogue for their humor As a silent film The General must rely mainly on images for its humorthe slapstick images of Johnnie falling over constantly the unusual image of Johnnie riding up and down on the crossbar between the train wheels the stereotype exploitation in the scene when the girl sweeps out the locomotive Im sure that some of the things that I considered amusing might not have been considered funny by the original audience such as the recordscratch lightning bolts,0
459,tt0017925, Georgia USA The American Civil War is in its second year and Johnnie Gray is barred from enlisting He is a train engineer and the Confederate Army feel he is more valuable to the Southern cause in his current role than in the army This frustrates Johnnie and has estranged him from his sweetheart Annabelle who views him as a coward Then his beloved engine The General is stolen by Union spies and is heading for Union lines Moreover Annabelle is on board Johnnie sets off after the two loves of his lifeGreat comedy from the silent era directed and starring one of the greatest comedy directors and actors of that era Buster Keaton This is a rollicking adventure complete with wonderfully thoughtout and performed physical comedy and other sight gags Some very clever use of the plot to generate the comedyThe plot itself isnt overly profound but crams in a lot of action and adventure plus some romanceVery entertaining,8
460,tt0017925,THE GENERAL When one watches for the first time the General great things happen laughter relief a neverending smileand that old sniff of old good cinema I must admit not many films out there give the pleasure this one has It is like everything just falls right into place Overall the movie is a perfect account of all the things that make comedy great Simplicity good and twisted plot a sense of the unexpected becoming more and more realDo you feel me dont you? It has been attributed to Chalie Chaplin the following sentence to make a comedy film you only need three things a park a woman and a police officer We can safely say The General stands up to it Well there is no park in The General although the landscape is used wisely but theres a woman As for the police officerwell not exactly What we do have in the film are soldiers Im afraid of telling you the plot of the story because I dont want to spoil anything I reckon itd be better if you find it out for yourselves Well lets just say that Buster Keaton plays the main character an engineer whose beloved locomotive has been stolen by Union spies From that point on he does everything in his power to get it back Theres nothing more for me to say butEnjoy yourselves!!,8
461,tt0017925,To watch The General is to be both awed and amused at what takes place The consensus view is correct This is an amazing movieYou know whats more amazing? Despite what most critics say Buster Keaton made funnier better films than thisKeaton a lifelong railroad buff is engineer Johnny Gray captain of The General a locomotive which carries passengers and freight across the American South When the Civil War breaks out he tries to enlist and thus please his girl Annabelle Lee Marion Mack but the authorities deem him more useful running trains When Union spies seize the General with an idea of using it to burn bridges and disrupt the Confederate supply line its up to Gray to save the dayNew York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall reviewed The General back in  and expressed disappointment This is by no means so good as Mr Keatons previous efforts he wrote People cite Halls review as a classic example of whatdocriticsknow but the more I read the more I agreed with him The fun is not exactly plentiful he wrote noting Keaton here was too much the acrobat too little the clownWhen I watched The General I felt disappointment too Like Halls it wasnt total; its exciting and inventive and boasts some of the finest screen compositions Ive ever seen The technical expertise on display is astounding Its just that the overall experience left me a bit flatFirst you have what Roger Ebert liked to call the idiot plot Gray tries to enlist and is rejected by the army because hes too valuable as a train engineer Annabelle apparently never learns this for she rejects him as a coward I dont want you to speak to me again until youre in uniform she huffsEither hes an idiot for not explaining the truth of the matter or shes an idiot for preferring her lover be cannon fodder than a real asset to their cause Anyway Buster does manage to make this play later on When he finally speaks to her he is in uniform an enemy uniformThe other main issue involves what Lincoln called the slows A lot of the story is literally trainwatching Buster does some brave amazing stuntwork and throws in some clever gags later joined by Mack whos no Sibil Seely but still quite game but its basically a lot of watching trains go by The craft here is in the precision of the camerawork and the splitsecond timing not so much the comedy In fact except for Buster himself everyone plays it completely straight probably because this is real history being presented Compared to other Keaton comedies it feels a bit straitjacketed by thatThe General is still a solid thrill comedy with some amusing one liners If you lose this war dont blame me Johnny yells after being rejected and brilliant sight gags like the fussy Annabelles rejection of unattractive firewood while Buster struggles to stoke the engineTo me thats enough for The General to be another good reason for loving Buster Keaton I just cant understand it being the preeminent reason Maybe critics cant really love a comedy for just making you laugh and laugh Im just glad Keaton made other movies at least as brilliant as The General and funnier too,7
462,tt0017925,Buster Keaton s performance in The General was purely enjoyable The story takes place during the civil war on centers on Johnnie Gray Keaton a train operator in the South Johnnie is not accepted for service in the confederate army because of his value on the railroad and suffers the shame of being home while the other men are fighting a war When his beloved engine is hijacked by Union soldiers the unpredictable story goes into overdrive Johnnies adventure includes train chases rescuing the love of his life a daring escape and a climactic battle This film has a distinct action/adventure aspect but at its core it is a brilliant comedy/drama Keatons performance is superb He has the ability to effortlessly change your mood and the mood of the film with his facial expressions and physical comedy Keatons character seems to make endless mistakes that work for the best and good decisions in dangerous situations It is easy to imagine Keaton as a major influence for a future comedians and I personally felt like I was watching the Mel Brooks of a previous generation The General was a fun film to watch with a true star Buster Keaton turning in a timeless heartfelt performance,7
463,tt0017925,When watching The General  the similarities between Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin are almost unmistakable The story was original and humorous and the performance by Buster Keaton was pleasing What I didnt like was the fact that the protagonist still was pursuing the girl who was so quick to leave him when she thought he wasnt brave and then ends up staying with her at the end He is too good for her I thought the stunt where the bridge gives out and the train falls was very well done and must have cost a fortune There were scenes where I found myself laughing out loud and scenes where I was bored So unfortunately the film doesnt do a great job at keeping the viewer glued to the screen but overall it was enjoyable,7
464,tt0017925,I feel the The General is a great silent film because even though the story line is relatively complicated the way in which each character played their part and the way it was filmed made it easy to follow I am fairly new to the silent film experience and when I saw that this movie was partially a comedy I was expecting something more along the lines of Charlie Chaplin however I was pleasantly surprised at Buster Keatons more subtle comedic style I felt that the film was well shot shot considering the technology of the day I was actually shocked during the scene where the Rock River Bridge collapsed under The Texas Knowing full well it was not special effects I couldnt believe the producers would spare the expense of destroying a locomotive and an entire bridge This movie is sure to be one of my favorite silent films,7
465,tt0017925,Buster Keaton always amazes me He was truly one of the most hilarious deadpan screen clowns of early cinema And The General even clocking in at around three hours is surprisingly watchable based on his physical performance aloneGranted I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything thats unnecessary but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments There are multiple points in the General a story about a Southern engineer that has to rescue his beloved from the clutches of the North in the Civil War where Keatons character Johnnie Gray has to stop his train jump out and remove something from the tracks which in itself can be quite boring but the way that Keaton injects physical comedy into those moments keeps me entertainedAnd its a marvel how so many realistic yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with Its nothing fantastic like some of his other films but its still funny And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversitybut he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and its just enough to know that he is frightened but that the rest of him doesnt react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny Whether hes pratfalling due to surprise or erroneously succeeding at something hes unskilled in and being shocked by it that response of his is winningBut the General does show its age a little It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesnt get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context I wouldnt dare cut those moments out of this film even if I could reedit it because the space always had something going on but at the same time this film if made today would be cut to oneandahalf or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly The plot and story are simple but exist more than to just help the comedy move alongexcept at the end when the first story was accomplished Then we move into a second extraneous but still amusing story regarding a battle between the North and the South that couldve been excised and still having a decent though simple storyI didnt really love the score that the DVD company attached to it which is a number of classical pieces end on end I think a new commissioned soundtrack wouldve better matched the piece but I guess we get what we get And on the plus side you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of itIs it perfect? No But despite the age it shows it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinemas greatest physical comedians If you want to spend three hours with a silent clown this is not a bad way to go /,8
466,tt0017925,Have a lot of appreciation for comedy especially the witty and sophisticated kinds and there are a good deal of classic comedies that go for the broad approach too Am significantly less keen though on the vulgar puerile style of humour that is seen quite a lot today the worst of it veering on the offensive There are many instances of silent films/comedies seen with Charlie Chaplin prime Laurel and Hardy and with Buster KeatonKeaton is seen as one of the greats by many but for some reason doesnt seem to be quite as well known even with a just as good reputation critically as Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy who transitioned better into sound maybe when at his best in the s an extraordinary period with a deservedly lauded reputation he was every bit as great as funny and as likeable His daring physical comedy and stoic deadpan expressions were unique and ahead of its time at the time and still amaze and are distinct now plus he was a bigger risktaker with bolder material and immense courage that most wish they could have Which perhaps hasnt been more apparent than in this film The General often considered one of his best and most important films or even his masterpiece though with other just as worthy efforts it has been debated and justifiably so This paragraph is very subjective of course and probably wont be agreed with but that is just my respectful stanceThe General to this day still looks great and remarkably lavish something of a technical achievement in its day It also should be used as an example of how to have effects that still look good and like a lot of effort and care went into them and also use them properly rather than overusing and abusing them to gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now The locomotive features heavily here and to ingenious and quite imaginative effect The direction keeps the momentum going with ease and balances all The Generals elements every bit as adeptlyWhen it comes to the humour which is very physical it is never less than very funny and is timed inventively throughout no corniness at all and it gels very well But The General is much more than just a comedy and one can say that its not really one It has other elements too and executes them even better actually especially the action the scope dexterity and boldness of it and especially those stunts absolutely jawdropping and truly exciting to watch It is also an example of how to have action that thrills while being easy on the eyes coherent and not being too noisy or busy something to learn fromAlso here is a tender understated quality that is very surprising and the romantic element is genuinely charming without being sappy The film also has a story thats easy to follow and at the same time is logical and interesting indicating a film with brains as well as soul that treats the viewer with respect rather than getting irritated by credibility straining and logic lapses Keaton is superb here not only is his comic timing on point but he provides a character thats endearing and worth rooting for His physicality and how he copes with the stunts is aweinspiring and he is one of not many to make deadpan interesting and entertaining because he still makes it very expressive and nuanced The rest of the cast are easy to overlook but are just as strong even if with not as much to do or with material that sticks in the mind as muchOverall brilliant and a Buster Keaton essential / Bethany Cox,10
467,tt0017925,There are some truly wonderful scenes in this film which is full of adventure comedy and some pretty impressive stuntwork on moving trains by Buster Keaton and the other actors The premise is that Keaton a train conductor has volunteered to fight for the South at the outset of the Civil War but been turned down When his train is stolen by Union soldiers he immediately gives chase on foot then a handcar briefly a bicycle and then finally another train not knowing quite yet that his girlfriend Marion Mack was inadvertently also kidnappedIn one of the memorable early scenes Keaton is sitting on the connecting rod of the locomotive lost in thought when it starts up bobbing him up and down In another he packs a cannon on his train with a massive charge and as its angle slowly descends before firing it appears hes going to blow himself up until his train at the last minute hits a curve and he nearly hits his intended target Its just wonderful There is also of course the scene with a Union train going out onto a burning bridge which then collapses one of the most iconic and expensive scenes of the eraIn addition to those big moments there are also innumerable little things Keaton does which highlight his genius He is just so lovable and talented He uses one of the large railroad ties intended to derail him to knock another off the track as his train is moving When hes hiding under a table surrounded by Union officers hes subtly kicked and jostled in funny ways As he makes his escape with Mack he stuffs her into a large sack that he had emptied of shoes only to lose his own shoe in the process and struggle to locate it I also thought I saw bits of Woody Allen in the scene where he urges her to be quiet only to knock things over and make noise himselfAmbitious aweinspiring influential clever and still funny + years later Is it the best ever? I dont know I liked The Cameraman  even more but still – damn good,9
468,tt0017925,Buster Keaton is Johnnie Gray a southerner who wants to fight for the cause but gets rejected because he could be of more use as an engineer than as a soldier Unfortunately hes not told why he was turned down and his gal just assumes that hes a coward Not so because when a Yankee scallywag steals his beloved steam engine the titular The General Johnnie heads north to recover the engine and through a series of misadventures becomes a hero of the Confederacy and rescues Annabelle Lee Glorious sight gags abound as Old Stone Face deals with errant cannon loose sword blades uncooperative firewood inexplicable soakings and a lessthanhelpful rescuee not to mention an entire army of bluebellies Great fun from another era and a wonderful example of the silent genre,8
469,tt0017925,Buster Keaton plays the lead in this silent era masterpiece that takes its inspiration from the Great Locomotive Chase which in turn was a real event during the American Civil War in which a train was stolen by the North and sped over the lines in preparation for the coming offenseThe General has some definitive upsides working in its favour Buster Keaton is an amazingly versatile performer able to go from clownish jokester to a saddened victim of war and poor circumstances in a heartbeat The film is also really ambitious in scope Keaton performs all of his stunts most of them hairraisingly dangerous and completely unimaginable nowadays Plus very little money is spared and the film famously has some of the most expensive set pieces and stunts of the silent eraThe plot of the film is also a lot more cohesive than say in the films made by Charlie Chaplin in the same decade Chaplins films usually contain segments that have little to do with anything except the need for funny situations The General is also a comedy but with a clear clean story arcOn the other hand I didnt find the humour or the characters as captivating Theyre okay but in this regard the decades of cultural development between the film and yours truly work against the film I just didnt find the slapstick all that funnyStill The General is a great watch for all interested in early cinema or really involved physical humour,0
470,tt0017925,The General is one of the great films and treasures of the silent era Its among the best movies of the talented comedy actor Buster Keaton In this film Keaton shows the athletic ability and courage that made him one of the best of the early comedians who performed their own stunts His physical antics on and off his train The General support his title as king of comedy stunts All the silent era comedy actors seemed to have lots of energy And many had daring courage and even madness at times Those were the actors who did all or most of their own stunts While there were some stunt men around in the early s it wasnt until the last of the silent years and dawn of sound pictures that stuntmen were a regular part of the cast of films that required any amount of derringdo And while a small number of actors today will still do some of their own stunts nothing can compare to the actors of old who performed their own highrisk and dangerous stunts – and sometimes those for other actors The five best early actors at doing stunts were Buster Keaton Douglas Fairbanks Sr Harold Lloyd Tom Mix and Yakima Canutt The latter two specialized in Westerns and besides acting and doing stunt work Mix and Canutt regularly rode and performed in the rodeo circuit Lloyd was versatile in his venues but excelled at high stunts on buildings and sometimes with wild animals Fairbanks excelled in swashbuckler stunts sliding down the sails of ships swinging from anything hanging aloft and jumping with the help of trampolines into windows Keaton was even more versatile As a child actor in vaudeville Keaton learned how to fall to avoid injury He called his technique soft falls or landings But even with his training and practice his film roles with derringdo often left him bruised at the least At other times he had suffered injuries from slight to serious Still he had become known for his physical resiliency During the filming of The General in  Keaton was knocked unconscious by canon fire He suffered a broken ankle while filming the  short The Electric House And he broke his neck during the  shooting of Sherlock Jr but didnt know it until years later This movie has an interesting plot set during the US Civil War It opens with a scene and script that reads The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marietta Georgia in the spring of  The train seems to be traveling about  miles per hour But the film is almost entirely about action and the comedy in the action involving the train There is an element of romance The cast all are very good The photography is superb Much of the action with trains is filmed in Westcentral Oregon from Eugene to Cottage Grove Theres no information about sound at all so I assume the music we hear with the film is soundtrack that was added for modern viewing It probably is meant to replicate the piano accompaniment that was usual with silent films in theaters of the day This is one instance when I think the piano playing would have been better The music seems to go overboard at times This is one of the early great films from the silent era that showcase the talent and early mastery of moviemaking skills Its a fun movie with strong visuals that even a modern family of all ages should enjoy,10
471,tt0017925,Johnnie Gray a train engineer tries to enlist in the Confederate Army to impress his girlfriend Unfortunately he is rejected because his role as engineer is deemed more important Lucky for Gray he is given the opportunity to prove himself when a band of Union soldiers in disguise hijack a trainAt the time of this films release it was a flop and considered to be not very funny Since then it has gone on to be declared one of the greatest films of all time Funny how that works I would tend to agree that it isnt really very funny but it is a great film for a variety of reasonsBuster Keaton was an amazing actor and director He was willing to put himself in dangerous situations for a laugh  he was his own stuntman right there when the train falls in the water really sitting on the side of a moving train and on the front of it he could have been killed And this was captured on film flawlesslyPersonally I enjoyed his Sherlock Jr better I thought the tricks were better and the action funnier It had a faster pace too that kept me hooked enough to watch it a few times The General was not boring but as a silent film it could have done more to grab the audience and Im not sure that it did,7
472,tt0021749,If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend as others have pointed to in the past City Lights is the one Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies like Modern Times and The Gold Rush City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest his bravest his most romantic and his most sympathetic Its tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters but its pulled off The film centers on three characters the Tramp the quintessential funny homeless man who blends into the crowd but gets caught in predicaments He helps a drunken businessman Myers a fine performance in his own right from suicide and becomes his on and off again friend that is when it suits him and doesnt notice his friends state The other person in the Tramps life is the Blind Flower Girl Virginia Cherrill one of the most absorbing beautiful and key female performances in silent film who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money which leads to a how else can I put it magical boxing match where its basically a  from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull Though there is no dialog the film achieves a timelessness its essentially a tale of two loners who find each other lose each other and find each other again the last scene widely discussed by critics for decades is moving if not tearinducing And its never ever boring once you get along with the Tramp you find the little things about him the reaction shots the little things he does after the usual big gag look to the ballroom scene for examples of this or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing Truth be told if this film makes you indifferent never watch Chaplin again But if you give yourself to the film you may find its one of the most charming from the era or perhaps any era,10
473,tt0021749,Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplins City Lights a masterpiece Its only  minutes long but they are among the best  minutes you could spend at the movies and the last five minutes are simply exquisite Keep your Kleenex box at arms length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says Yes I can see now the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanationChaplin was at his zenith in  when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story and the Little Tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade He had already made the classics The Gold Rush  and The Circus  starring his character so its obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time The advent of talkies didnt stop Chaplin from making this Comedy Romance in Pantomime as he subtitled it as he knew giving the Little Tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character What I particularly enjoyed in this film is how the Little Tramp fancies himself as a wellmannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down even going to prison for love It is this selfdelusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl played in an effectively plaintive manner by Virginia Cherrill Her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable Simply compare her to the screen test shown of Georgia Hale Chaplins leading lady in The Gold Rush and an obviously more experienced actress than Cherrill as Hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the Little Tramp is the wealthy gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sightOf course this would not be a Chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes  the rising and lowering of the street elevator the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers and was according to the footage included as a DVD extra inspired by an earlier Chaplin short The Champion from  Even a simple moment for example when the Little Tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment And special mention needs to go to Chaplins musical score where he beautifully interweaves José Padillas La Violetta as his love themeThe transfer to DVD is very good and the DVD set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality The Serge Bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film and the footage of Chaplin from a Vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the longforgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then The aforementioned Georgia Hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long The minute home movie of Chaplins trip to Bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise Regardless the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies Chaplins reputation as one of the worlds leading filmmakers,10
474,tt0021749,This is my favorite Chaplin film but I dont want that to diminish his other work either MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick and even the largelyneglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone Chaplin didnt make a bad movie and Im not even sure that CL is his best exactly But it IS my favorite if only for the endingThat ending has been the subject of much comment here I think its a masterpiece in a single scene Chaplins little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living breathing human being Its a monument to understated sentimentalityTo me the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid Yes the boxing scene is great and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful but its that ending that makes us all love this movie,0
475,tt0021749,Once again Chaplin plays his famous creation the beloved Tramp The noble Little Fellow meets and falls in love with a blind flower girl She assumes he is wealthy man and offers him a flower which he attentively accepts with his last penny One night by chance he rescues a drunken millionaire from drowning The rich gentleman becomes a generous friend when drunk but doesnt recognize the tramp when sober Chaplin takes the blind girl under his wing and takes flight with the millionaires money to cure her blindness City Lights engaged a true genius in a graceful and touching performance which arouses profound feelings and joy with great simplicity of style and tragic tale Each scene was the result of hardworking detail and planning,9
476,tt0021749,Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights and the results are spectacular The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights and even though Charlies performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant City Lights is so well made that it is one of the very few movies in which the obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked Yes you can clearly see the string holding Chaplin up in the sidesplittingly funny boxing scene but who cares? That is such classic slapstick that little things like that really dont matter Besides lets keep in mind that this movie was made seventy years ago Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk His friendship with the drunken rich guy is hilarious but it also makes a significant comment about the problems of alcohol This is truly a great film which should not be forgotten,10
477,tt0021749,Charlie Chaplins City Lights contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it  Although made very much in the oldfashioned silent film tradition much of it is timeless tooAfter a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning Charlies little tramp character makes two acquaintances  He meets a blind girl selling flowers who mistakes him for a rich man and the two become very fond of each other Then he meets a real millionaire who is drunk depressed and about to commit suicide  In a comic scene the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it making himself a devoted friendThe tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight and tries to think of some way he could help  His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades  his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny and one of Chaplins best comic pieces Meanwhile when his millionaire friend is drunk he dotes on the tramp but when sober he forgets who the tramp is leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for CharlieAll of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the bestremembered scenes in any film  City Lights shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master who without words can move his audience or make them laugh  Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once,0
478,tt0021749,Film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia  Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are  Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation  We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new  In City Lights and other silent works of film a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere  While watching the film I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story the sets the crew; the whole project  While this may not have been the complete reality it felt that way and thus made the film more enjoyable  In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional responseSince film is at its very core a visual medium I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium  I dont use the word basic here in a demeaning sense but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance  Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced but they were and are beautiful  The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic There is a warmth found in City Lights and other Chaplin films The Kid Modern Times that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today  Maybe its just that with simplicity comes honesty and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer,0
479,tt0021749,City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of filmmaking Chaplins last silent film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the mans wealth to make her fall in love with him The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesnt recognize the tramp anymore On top of this the flower girl has to pay  dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forthThe outcome of the movie is to almost all people known It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film The movie itself still is masterpiece more than  years after its release I personally rate this as Chaplins second best I have seen so far My favorite remains The Gold Rush Still this movie gets / stars from me,9
480,tt0021749,I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplins nicest most underappreciated silent movie gems Then I discovered it really wasnt underrated; its rated very high on most critics lists It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this onePart of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that Im a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one Its a romance between Charlies tramp character no name and a blind girl who also had no name in this film Virginia Cherill who played the blind woman and had a wholesome pretty face which I found very attractiveIm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as talkies were out in full force by  Chaplin was at his best in silent movies anyway and his comedy routines are legendary He gave me a lot of laughs in this film as always and I particularly laughed I love slapstick at the boxing scene Kudos too to Harry Myers as the eccentric millionaireTheres a lot of drama as well as humor in this minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sightComedy romance drama with suffering all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment Its hard to believe this movie was not up for one single Academy Award,9
481,tt0021749,CITY LIGHTS United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  l is a silent comedydrama released at the height of the sound era Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad Chaplin gambled with this production and made it pay off Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH  as the one movie he would most want to be remembered CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time practically places his other silent masterpiece THE CIRCUS  to oblivion CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama but in Chaplins case pathosSubtitled A comedy romance in pantomime the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city After the unveiling the crowd finds a little tramp Charlie Chaplin sleeping on the lap of one of the figures As he tries to climb down he encounters one problem after another This opening scene alone is priceless With such a great beginning Chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot The theme to CITY LIGHTS is remembered mainly about a tramps love for a blind girl However there is a subplot involving the tramps involvement with a millionaire drunk which by far takes up more time than the sentimental love story These two segments actually set the pattern First segment set in the afternoon finds Charlie walking down the street examining a nude statue in a shop being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing He encounters a beautiful blonde girl Virginia Cherrill selling flowers After she drops one of her flowers Charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it thus realizing shes blind Smitten by her beauty he picks it up and pays her for it Minutes later the slamming of a limousine door is heard with the girl believing the kind gentleman Charlie to be a millionaire Second segment set at night finds Charlie encountering a drunk Harry Myers trying to commit suicide by drowning himself Just as Charlie is about to save him he in turn falls into the river The drunk in gratitude for saving his life takes Charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn By morning the millionaire now sober fails to recognize or remember Charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion This running gag thats repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious but Chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges By day Charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when shes not at her usual corner selling flowers Finding that shes ill and being cared by her grandmother Florence Lee whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction Charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs ranging from streetcleaning to fighting in a boxing match Reading in a newspaper of a European doctor who restores sight for the blind Charlie gives the girl $ for an operation the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire who after sober accuses Charlie of robbing him has his arrested and serving jail time The climatic finish is truly the best thing Chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missedFeatured in the supporting cast are Henry Bergman Allan Garcia Albert Austin and Hank Mann While much has been discussed about Chaplins performance his costar Virginia Cherrill as the blind girl no name given should not go without mention Even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor Cary Grant her performance is excellent by all means Although its been said that future film star Jean Harlow  appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence she is visible in a surviving still photograph but no such scene appears in the finished product Unlike THE GOLD RUSH CITY LIGHTS had limited showings in revival houses in later years and was never allowed to be distributed to television Being first introduced to CITY LIGHTS at New York Citys revival movie house The Regency Theater formerly located on Broadway and th Street in  the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience There was one man probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film No doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else Watching CITY LIGHTS surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in After Chaplins death in December of  CITY LIGHTS along with his other silent features were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure but became readily available on video cassette at the time of Chaplins th birthday  In later years CITY LIGHTS was frequently revived on various cable channels ranging from Turner Network Television TNT in the early s American Movie Classics up to  and finally Turner Classic Movies The complete musical soundtrack that accompanies CITY LIGHTS happens to be the original score composed to perfection by Chaplin himself Much has been written and said about CITY LIGHTS over the years To learn more about the making difficulties and long term preparations to CITY LIGHTS either watch Kevin Blownlows  documentary Hollywood A Celebration of the American Silent Film as narrated by James Mason or Brownlows other documentaries dedicated entirely to Chaplins career including outtakes to CITY LIGHTS as well as scenes involving Virginia Cherrills temporary replacement Georgia Hale Chaplins costar in THE GOLD RUSH ****,10
482,tt0021749,Spoilers hereinFor me this film falls not into the category of favorite films Im a Marx brothers kind of guy but earns instead a place on a very short list of most important moviesThats because it has two features that I truly appreciateIt is as pure a vision of its creator as is possible Nearly all other films are engineered from prior work Not so with a small list of projects from Welles Kurosawa Eisenstein  and this one project of Chaplins They are wholly original springing from some nether worldBut the other element is the one that impresses the most This film is about itself about the art of visual narrative Chaplin was intelligent enough to know that what he was doing was new The issues are centered on what the audience `sees so while he struggles with what and how the audience sees he builds that into the fabric of the storyThe primary framing is about the blind girl who falls in love with him by `seeing him in her own way Then `sees him at the end in a different way The rich man recognizes the tramp when drunk but does not when he is not Nearly all the jokes indeed every element of the film is about this same dynamic the elevator which is not seen but then was the burglars the same the Tramp on the statue on the barrel Even seeing the cigar before the bum does Even us seeing the soap and the foreman notThe `seeing is carried over to `hearing with the politician and whistle jokes And then even further as Charlie turns his back on the new technology of giving us speech and instead `shows us something else he writes and conducts an amazing score instead This is truly amazing and one reason to take Mike Figgis seriouslyNo wonder Orson Welles considered this the most important film ever made But as to the best to watch? Because film is so derivative my own gold standard for the Tramp is Robert Downeys and to some extent Depps Comic timing is something that evolves and those men make a more effective Tramp for my modern ability to seeTrivia Chaplin found the `blind girl in a group of spectators at a fight and was struck with how her expressions reflected what she saw Shes pretty as well of course but certainly not the prettiest Chaplin knew See how Chaplin separately works in both the fight a performance and her reaction to his performance in the film,0
483,tt0021749,Waddling along with his cane and derby hat and that tiny mustache the little tramp Charles Chaplin is visually unlike any character in film history The tramp is kindhearted always dignified Hes a simple soul who in City Lights tries to help out a young blind woman well played by Virginia Cherrill This is a silent film of course but the tramps body language is his speechThe really noticeable feature of the tramp character is how he blends into everyday life Hes more or less ignored by many laughed at by others The girls grandmother never sees him at all And only when the millionaire is drunk does he see the tramp as a friend Curious  and deepThe tramp gets into his fair share of trouble but only through his bumbling efforts to help the girl The boxing match is a hoot and very well choreographed as are all the skits And what a beginning for a film with city leaders spouting gibberish probably as Chaplins dig at the talkies Then the way Chaplin makes his grand entrance  just terrific!Melancholy at times the films music really tugs at your heartstrings Maybe its sentimental and manipulative But given the abiding and Zenlike qualities of the tramp some sentimentality is quite appropriate And the music is choreographed totally in sync with the plot actionProduction design is sparse and at times drab That the film was made during the Great Depression is beyond obviousComedy here is simple and effective The main character expresses heart and humanity The little tramp is an unforgettable character And City Lights is a wonderful film,10
484,tt0021749,Chaplin was a unique presence in the history of the early cinema  Coming up through the ranks he gradually achieved a godlike stature being awarded total control of every facet of the productionNot only was he often the sole person who knew what the end product was to be as in The Kid but he was also allowed to elaborately improvise in the creative process  This often meant doing countless scores of retakes over days weeks and even months; holding up the cast and crew for days while he brooded over just what to do next; and even in the case of The Gold Rush cancelling expensive weeks of location shooting and returning to the studio to start all over againHe cleverly duped chief studio and bank chiefs into somehow going along with his freewheeling and gross inclinations thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hitandmiss schemes and trialanderror madnessIn other words Chaplin used the entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush with which he toyed at his pleasure to create his personal canvases  Fortunately he was a genius and at the right place in time to be allowed to get away with such unprecedented extravagenceIt was a young and growing industry when Chaplin began emerging and there were no set rules  People were still trying to figure out just what could be done with the medium  and Chaplin helped to establish its early parametersHe was certainly and autocrat yet that doesnt really matter when it comes to film works  Its the product that counts  In the case of City Lights all the bloodsweatandtears that it took to achieve the finished product was more than worth the effort  Now that all the frustration anger and outrage associated with the behindthescenes unfoldment of this highly troubled production are well in the past what remains is a genuinely moving film classic,10
485,tt0021749,The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one The first fulllength talkies were released in  By  theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business By  silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism But in  a new silent picture was released that far from being an embarrassing failure became the fourthhighest grossing picture of the year being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy The picture was City Lights and its producer writer director editor composer and star was Mr Charlie ChaplinChaplin was of course primarily a comedian and his humour was of broad appeal but audiences of the time were not exactly starved of easy comedy The Marx Brothers were making great strides on the verbal quipping front and the everpopular Laurel and Hardy had made a successful transition to sound What makes Charlie stand out and what gave him a level of accessibility that allowed him to continue with his slapstick antics well into the sound era is his equal devotion to story which allowed him a scope for social commentary empathetic characterisation and deep poignancy Of all Chaplins silent pictures City Lights is probably his least memorable in the funny stakes The number of classic gags here is fairly small Not since The Kid a decade earlier has Chaplin given story so much precedence City Lights is riddled with coincidence and plot contrivance but its a tale of such beauty and sincerity that this does not matter Within this story the comedy becomes functional often serving to puncture a schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone Ironically it is the occasional forays into slapstick that help keep City Lights realAs if to snub the talkie City Lights is a remarkable achievement in complex visual narrative even only occasionally relying upon title cards and then often only as an embellishment to the more comedydriven moments Most plot points and character traits are implied rather than stated which gives the picture a continual smoothness – another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad to see the back of the intrusive title card Out of necessity Chaplins technical approach is more overt than his usual He often cuts to a closeup to give us a necessary reaction and there are even some whippans in the scene where he and the flower girl first meet but all of this is in keeping with the rhythm and tone of the picture Those whip pans after all reflect an abrupt emotional moment and are in no way a blatant or showy manoeuvreBut what really makes City Lights work what makes it connect is the man himself on the screen Those additional closeups once a rarity for a man who acted mainly with his body now show off a capability for intense facial acting An older more meditative Chaplin may have been keeping the traditions of silent cinema alive but his own career trajectory was entering new ground where emotional expression was increasingly intimate and personal The result is profoundly moving,10
486,tt0021749,City Lights is a different film from what I am used to seeing I have not watched a Silent film or pantomime in a few years I really enjoyed the story that Charles Chaplin helped to create and produce for our enjoyment The plot seems to be commonly used now with a boy falling in love and trying to win the girls love in return In City Lights there are a few twists to the plot The girl is blind and poor the TrampChaplinis poor in love and wants to help the blind girl The Millionaire can help the tramp out by giving him money but he is an onagain offagain friend depending on whether or not he is drunkBeing that this is a silent film there is more importance on the use of props and the acting of the character Since in a silent film they cant tell us how they are feeling it is important that we can understand feelings through action This may be through facial expressions body language dress eye contact kinds of touch or the use of written statements like title cards in a silent film A prop that stood out to me was the use of flowers From the flower girl selling her flowers to how Chaplin was always holding or smelling one of the flowers from his special girl the use of flowers helped show the emotions and feelings of the two characters It symbolized the affection he had for her because like the flowers she couldnt see she couldnt see the true him or his true affections Another prop that was used was money From the millionaires point of view money was really of no matter He threw a party just because he had been reunited with his friend he went out to the dance club and when Chaplin needed money in order to help the flower girl pay for rent and surgery he was willing to give him one thousand dollars To the millionaire this money is nothing but to Chaplin and the flower girl this is a showing forth of love and charity When the movie was made in the s many people were poor and hopeless but the portrayal of Chaplin as a poor but happy and hopeful man might have given hope to others who watched this movie during the Depression In the film I noticed the use of a repetition or rather a parallelism as was read in the Film Art book dealing with The Wizard of Oz They show shots one way in Kansas and then reverse the shot in Oz as I saw in City Lights In City Lights parallelism is done with sight not necessarily with eyes but with the mind We see the reverse where the poor blind girl sees Chaplin as a millionaire and then at the end she sees him as the tramp he is with her new eyesight The true reverse is emphasized because she is now working in a shop and making money The two characters are somehow always at perceived opposite ends of the social class spectrum yet he still has a desire for her to be happy because of his love Another reverse is the happy friendly drunk millionaire who sees Chaplin as his friend and hero for stopping him from committing suicide However when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him throws him out and even has him arrestedIn a way this film is different then what our generation might be used to but by watching these classics we can better learn where the movies we love today came from and gain a better appreciation for the art of film,7
487,tt0021749,The tramp tries to nurture and help a blind flower girl regain sight despite scant resources and the prejudices and graft of the big city Although the physical gags lack the largescale invention of the factory scenes in Modern Times and the criticism of the wealthy doesnt transcend an admittedly witty recurring jokethe aristocrat friend can only demonstrate compassion and friendliness in an inebriated state; hes always inviting the tramp in only to incredulously throw him out the next sober morningthe tramps touching earnestness in rescuing his angel from a life of abjection is simple and selfless and deeply moving I would say it also fades out at the perfect moment of openended ambiguitythe viewer is forced to make resonant meaning out of the final troublingly cathartic shot even as the film articulates a consistent worldview in relation to what has come before In my eyes Modern Times is Chaplins masterpiece but City Lights would probably better merit repeat viewings which is as much a testament to the films power as anything else,8
488,tt0021749,City Lights is probably one of the most well loved along with Modern Times Chaplin movies The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp one of the most lovable truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps like they are labeled lazy and troublesome It is very hard to hate The Tramp because he gives so much when he has so little He spends his time and money giving to people  whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl Undoubtedly we all have a little bit of The Tramp in usThe plot is as follows the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street She is poor and by a mere coincidence believes that The Tramp is rich He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide and despite his gratefulness doesnt remember the poor tramp unless he is drunkCity Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history Its poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy I believe it is a strong mixture of both and a great balance of the two Both comedic and touching City Lights should not be missed by anyone,8
489,tt0021749, its perhaps a test of a persons outlook to ask them what they see in the final scene If theyve never seen City Lights before and they instantly notice the major continuity issue Chaplin holds a flower to his lapel from the rear shot its up to his mouth on his close up then maybe theyve placed film studies over romanceIt took a few viewings before I spotted this and once I did I cant help but notice it Yet even despite this I never fail to get choked up on the beauty of that final scene If you want to impress the right kind of girl put it on and show her what a sensitive soul you are during those final momentsAs for the rest of the film then while the final five minutes are classic and perhaps the best thing Chaplin ever did the rest of it is episodic and patchy necessitating my relatively low score Still a fine film but never a completely great one what presages those beautiful final moments is merely fine entertainment,7

491,tt0021749,As always the little tramp is fleeing the long arm of the law when he is mistaken for a wealthy man by a blind girl selling flowers by the roadside While he longs to help her the tramp knows he cannot However when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon a drunken man who he helps out who may be able to help him in turn  if the two of them can sober up long enoughIn response to seeing some modern trash posing as comedies recently Little Man Norbit Pluto Nash  Im looking at you I decided to check out some comedies that have stood the test of time  a few Chaplin films being among them City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start As was often the case this film has a thin narrative but one that allows for several scenarios for Chaplin to work his magic And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole filmThe statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at His support do no more than that  support him  but yet they are also roundly good Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character while Myers Garcia Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside ChaplinCity Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent setpieces that tickle and also stick in the mind So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead,0

493,tt0021749,Four years into sound Charlie Chaplin wrote performed directed and scored one of films finest masterpiecesThe story is about the Little Tramp befriending a blind woman who mistakenly thinks he is rich Along the way he manages to get into a series of unintentional fixes with a large cast of foils at his disposal as he struggles to finance an operation for the womanIn an incredible display of comic talent Chaplin bombards the audience with scene after scene of magnificently choreographed comedy Drunk dancing or boxing his graceful slapstick is a rare combination of comedy and beauty a comic ballet Chaplins performing artistry as well as his ideas reach their apex with City Lights where only Chaplin would dare to challenge the naturally progressive trend and technological status quo by daring to make a silent By pulling it off with aplomb he solidified his place atop the history of the profession Some sound is used sparingly brilliantly with a statue dedication and a piano keyboard but no intelligible words are uttered The track and Chaplins score is lyrical energized and integral The film is perfectly constructedIn the masterful hands of Chaplin he avoids bathos in his scenes with the blind woman by severing the sentimentality and the scene with a comic moment saving it all for the incredibly touching and moving finale Up until then it is a display of comic genius that only a handful of others might lay claim to,10
494,tt0021749,As much as I loved The Kid The Gold Rush Modern Times and The Great Dictator City Lights is the film I consider Charlie Chaplins masterpiece And there are several reasons why this is so for meI love how City Lights is filmed once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets The music is also a delightthough my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times with plenty of themes that stuck in my head while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand The comedy is brilliantly done the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin moviealong with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator but ever in a comedy while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girlplayed touchingly by Virginia Cherrill he falls in love with And I also found the closeup climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity Chaplin is superb his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with CherrillOverall yet another Chaplin masterpiece yet for me this is the best of them all / Bethany Cox,10
495,tt0021749,Charlie Chaplin made some extremely funny shorts but of his longer films this is one of the best along with The Gold Rush and Modern Times Two stories are woven together One is Charlies onagain offagain friendship with a wealthy drunk The guy has a case of multiple personality When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts When hes sober he doesnt recognize Charlie at allThe second story involves a pretty blind flower girl who given certain distances angles and lighting resembles Uma Thurman Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballsCharlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy hes sober and wont support Charlies story Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel broke and bitter he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands The happy endingTheres sentimentality in the story of course There often is in Chaplins later films But as usual its somehow tempered Here its undercut by ironyWhen Charlie meets the wealthy toff the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope Hes about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes gives him a pep talk and changes his mind His spirit revived the rich guy spread his arms to the sky dropping the boulder that falls on Charlies footAnd when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl shes enthralled by his gentleness Unseen by her the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain himself enraptured Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlies face Well its not the blind Mr Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W C Fields general store but what is? A note There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film not counting the DempseyTunney debacle but I dont think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed hereIts hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this Black and white and silent Applause please,8
496,tt0021749,City Lights  **** out of Charlie Chaplin returns as The Tramp and this time he falls in love with a blind girl Virginia Cherrill and sets out to help her The Tramp eventually meets a suicidal drunk Harry Myers and their friendship leads to what might eventually help the girl he lovesChaplin made great films before and after CITY LIGHTS but for my money this here is his greatest film as well as one of the greatest films ever made Not only is it one of the funniest movies ever made but Id also argue that its one of the greatest love stories if not the greatest It really says a lot when a movie can conqueror two genres at one time but CITY LIGHTS is simply one of the greatest movies ever madeI think it says a lot that you get one classic scene after another and theres really not a weak spot to be found here Being  it took some real guts for Chaplin to deliver a silent film and I think he knew that he had to deliver something special because people had moved onto sound He certainly delivered something special as this here was easily the funniest film he had made up to this point The opening sequence with the introduction of The Tramp was priceless and we got one hilarious scene after another from that point The scenes with the drunk are downright hilarious as is another scene where The Tramp is trying to eat but without much success The cigar sequence is a masterpiece as is the by the water In fact the story between The Tramp and the drunk would have made a terrific movie on its own Just like the stuff with The Tramp and the blind girl would have made a perfect film Whats so special is that you get both stories wrapped up in one and it really deliversChaplin played The Tramp countless times but he was never better than he is here Just check out the timing in countless scenes including the boxing match and you cant help but be impressed with the actor Myers also deserves a lot of credit as the drunk as his timing has to match that of Chaplin throughout and the two men do a wonderful job together Then youve got Cherrill who wasnt a professional actor but the director makes her shine throughoutCITY LIGHTS contains one great scene after another and all of the laughs lead up to one of the most powerful endings in film history Theres really not enough great things that can be said about this film as it continues to get better with each passing year,0
497,tt0022100,Fritz Langs highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement and ended in the United States in  with the production of The Big Heat a film noir classic Perhaps his greatest film M Germany  forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones Even though M was Langs and Germanys first sound film many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late s While most early talkies return films to their static visually monotonous stage imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium M avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous offscreen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue The films editing particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling Of course many of the films sound effects are also imaginative and memorable none more so than the compulsive whistling of the films central character the stalker and serial killer of little girls Hans Beckert magnificently played by Peter Lorre Sound is also an important contributor to Ms rich and influential use of off screen space One famous example is the scene that introduces Beckert as a shadow against his own Wanted poster creepily intoning to his next victim Elsie Beckmann You have a very pretty ball Not only is Beckerts shadow a bow toward Langs expressionist artistic roots but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image  that is among us the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuousappearing albeit monstrous member Another example of Langs use of offscreen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is Elsies absence from them an empty chair at the Beckmann dinner table the vertiginous stairwell down which Elsies mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughters arrival the attic play area that awaits Elsies return from school Most memorable of all  and most often alluded to visually in other films  is the series of shots that indirectly record Beckerts assault and murder of the innocent child representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of Elsies ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame Never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated imagesBeyond its technical brilliance the keys to Ms lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of Hans Beckerts twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and trial Unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer Beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath Nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clearcut To be sure the gutreaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry capture Beckert and bring him to a mock formal trial whose conclusion is foregone Like many in America today Beckerts accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the monster in the surest way possible a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible Considering the heinousness of Beckerts crimes and the imperfections of a legal/medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again this emotional response is hard to resist Yet M is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism  quite the contrary Through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of Beckerts unkempt court appointed defense attorney and Beckerts own impassioned monologue Lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others guilty or not in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding Nazism in s Germany That the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks dresses and gestures like a Gestapo officer is no accident Moreover the letter M chalked on Beckerts back by one of his pursuers not only stands for murderer but also alludes to Gods marking of Cain While the popular misconception holds that the mark of Cain symbolizes his evil it in fact represents Gods warning to Cains flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance but to leave justice in Gods hands Translated into secular terms and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame Gods hands in M belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try Hans Beckert in the name of the Law,10
498,tt0022100,M /  **** 	M is a cinematic masterpiece of visual drama The stunning performances define the careers of exceptional actors such as Peter Lorre and Gustaf Grundgens Director Fritz Lang gives depth and dimension to his production by distinctly capturing the ecstasy of the films many characters and focusing accurately on individual situations This is an intriguing journey into the mind of a psychotic child murderer blending terror complexity and malignity in one amazing motion picture	Screenwriters Paul Falkenburg and Adlof Jansen construct the characters of M with distinctive personalities and three dimensional emotions Many lesser filmmakers give their characters no creativity outside the confines of the script In this movie each individual character has a mind of their own; they are free to roam the landscape of a inviting atmosphere	Fabricating such an impressive atmosphere is some of the best cinematography and lighting effects that I can remember watching This resplendent component creates the films terrific moody ambiance Suspense is one thing M contains in full context The movies third act is sheer peakhigh tension	Shot in black and white M stars Peter Lorre as PeterHans Beckert an extremely disturbed child murderer in the process of wreaking havoc on a neighborhood Parents everywhere are living in fear of their children being kidnapped and abruptly annihilated 	This picture contains a brilliantly crafted setup The visual setting creates a strongly developed opening Every scene works to either complicate the initial problem or propels the story through a firm narrative through line	The film captures the chaos of the town in terror perfectly M is more about the results of a serial killer than an actual serial killer Never do we directly witness a murder; the violent encounters are implied This method of film making perhaps makes the movies impact even greater With an creative perspective through a third person point of view the filmmakers repeatedly give us examples of a solid structure through characters and occurrences 	M offers a unforgettable challenging performance by Peter Lorre This extraordinary actor is tormenting and disturbing without embracing in extreme violent conduct He perspires with momentum and rapture This productions closing scenes are so deeply penetrating they entirely captivate the viewer Isnt this what movies are supposed to do?,10
499,tt0022100,M is a monumental film and seriously should be watched by all For a film like this to be made in  is just shocking Even if the film was released today it would still be nothing like we have seen before In our modern age of film making there has been a considerable rise in the production of films about serial killers their complexities and particularly about pathological ones Yet M is the first movie that comes to my mind when I think of the themes that have been in Psycho Silence of the Lambs Seven and not to mention countless moreThe film is lead by Peter Lorre in a transcending performance who plays the serial killer and rapist in which the film is centered around In this performance Lorre is successful in something that at the very least is rare to see in any kind of film compassion for a child killer and rapist Lorre makes the viewer see that he is not a criminal by choice but by a sickness of compulsion Too often then not is our perception of a psychotic killer having that look that puts fear into his or hers victims eyes Lorre doesnt do that but rather displays a frightened man a scared man One in which his desperation leads to his hazardous behavior His portrayal of a killer is not of a fearless one but of one consumed by fear Something that even today we as a people cannot understand let alone in The direction and writing of Fritz Lang is beyond comprehensible as he taps into the mind of a serial killer and his complexities He does so in such that we get an empathetic and compassionate illustration of all sides of the story This in which by then end of the film all points of view are more then well delivered to the audience Fritz Lang here has simply created here a timeless masterpiece One that excels in its technical aspects and enlightens the audience on a topic that other films still have not yet to match M inI highly recommend this film for many obvious reasons and conclusions This film was created by one of the all time great directors in Fritz Lang Langs command for the screen is mesmerizing and a joy to witness and so on and so forth Yet much of this is mostly superficial and a waste of time to continuously state M as I mentioned before takes a strong and original stance on an issue that we as a society yet have not fully resolved This film may not give you THE answer on this issue but it may sway that moral compass of yours that lies inside of all of us,10
500,tt0022100,The economy austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound and precise filmmakers Lang a master of the German expressionist film shot his first talkie a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies It was a shocking idea for its time based on the reallife killer Peter Kurten headlined as the Vampire of DüsseldorfM is about a terrorized city and a plump little man with wide eyes often chewing candy who is a pathological childkiller unable to control his urge for killing The film embodies several Lang themes the duality between justice and revenge mob hysteria the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in and for probably the first time in the cinema it adds a new dimension to suspense pity For the killer is clearly mentally sick He cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease and yet we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal rather than treated as a sick man Early in the film the killer is heard whistling the Grieg theme from In the Hall of the Mountain King This theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace And when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window the melody on the soundtrack told us chillingly that the murderer is there just out of sightThe Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since Casablanca The Maltese Falcon and The Mask of Dimitrios When the photographs of his victims all little girls are shown to him he jumps back and twitches with horrorWith powerful visuals Langs motion picture is Lorres first film His performance as the corpulent hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion Lorre is the archetypal outsideroutside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal He had only twelve lines of dialogIn the most famous of all about a pathological killer  Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho  Anthony Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy Psycho reeked with blood and horror whereas the suspense of M is subtle A childs balloon without an owner a rolling ball are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed The audience trapped in its seats torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight,8
501,tt0022100,The first time I saw M by Fritz Lang I almost didnt know what to make of it I was overwhelmed by the power of the performances the staging of the scenes the locations and the power that the simple story had with such complex circumstances Then I saw it again and a third time and I know that this is one of the best films ever to come out of Germany its a powerful statement about protecting our children if youre looking at it as a message movie but in reality it is just a piece of cinema heaven Thrillers today only wish they could draw a viewer into the mystery elements and have such unconventionality of the times Boiling down to this M is about a child Killer  the legendary character actor Peter Lorre in his first major role  who snatches children when their parents dont watch and continues on until an investigation goes underway But as the police investigate overly thoroughly into the real criminal underworld they know something is up that this is someone far more gone than they could ever be so they join in the hunt This all leads to one of the supreme dramatic climaxes in any thrillerOn the first viewing I just went straight for the story which is able to suck one in enough to make you feel dizzy But on the multiple viewings it becomes even more interesting as one can study the intricacy and indeed fullon artistry of Langs camera He puts it in unusual places at times and adds for good measure shades of dark and gray in many of the night scene this is by the way a precursor to filmnoir which Lang later became an important director in the s and s On top of this there is a very modern sense of style in the editing I remember a couple of scenes that surprised me editing wise One is where the cops I think it was the cops have an argument about the investigation two of them get into a shouting match and we get medium closeups of them going back and forth This is done quickly with a kind of intensity that isnt even captured in todays thrillers There is also the hunt for Lorre in the digging of the house where Lang cuts around constantly heightening the tension between the predators the criminals and the prey Lorre until its almost too much to takeThe disturbing aspects of the story of child abduction and murder have become benchmarks of a number of todays thrillers where the cop is usually the subject and the killer left more in the shadows in cat &amp; mouse style This doesnt happen here and because of it by the time we get to the final scene with Lorre being interrogated and giving his I cant help it speech it becomes something poetic tragic frightening Lang doesnt leave his message so simplistically he makes sure we know Lorres side too however twisted it has become and the antagonist is shown as human as opposed to these presentday thriller where the killers are barely given one dimension let alone two There were reports that during filming Lang put Lorre through torture ultimately causing the two to never work together again But nevertheless out of this comes a towering performance of a small wildeyed criminal in the midst of an extremely welltold and unpredictable mystery story In short if you dont know what youre in for when you hear that whistle those several infamous notes you may not at all,10
502,tt0022100,The opening scene of this movie is the first clue to its near perfection  A mother preparing dinner for her child waiting anxiously for her to return from school  Her hope and then distress as she hears people pass outside her door  While down in the streets of Berlin her daughter is receiving a balloon from a strange man in a long black coat  We know whats going to happen but its still horrific to watchFritz Lang you cinematic god!  A simple story of the underworld the police and a single man holding an entire city hostage and done with such precision and prenoir darkness that is oozes creepy suspense from beginning to endBut this movie is not so simple as the police inspectors trying to catch a devious murderer  its about the mob employing its network of beggars and petty thieves also trying to bring the killer to their own brand of justice Apparently the police crackdown caused by the murders is bad for business  so the mob begins to track him down as wellIts not only a great crime story and perhaps the first physiological thriller the murderer is schizophrenic but theres comments to be made here about the nature of justice and who should best dispense itIn all not only a trailblazing classic but THE trailblazing classic,10
503,tt0022100,This is a very interesting film on so many levels Its interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture  Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place  what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding Compare it with any American film from  and you cant help but see the differenceThe murderer artfully played by Peter Lorre has been killing children that have no link to him personally for months The police despite all of their efforts are unable to catch him mainly because there is no rhyme or reason in his choice of victims At first there is a focus on the victims and the hole left in their families by their killing Then the film shifts to two normally opposed groups  the police and the underworld After several months of no results by the authorities the police are unhappy because it reflects badly upon them and the underworld is unhappy because their activities are being disrupted because of the police doing constant raids in their efforts to capture the killerIn a particularly welldone part of the film the scene shifts back and forth between a conference of police and one of the underworld They discuss how they are going to catch the killer The police settle upon the idea of looking for people with a history of past mental problems that were pronounced cured and released The underworld decides to enlist an invisible group  the beggars  to follow every child at all times and therefore catch the killer Both groups focus on the right suspect the question is  who gets there first? M is a fascinating film that raises many topics  the death penalty a group of criminals that are criminals by choice causing less stress on society than a lone criminal that acts out of an uncontrollable compulsion and the motivations of the authorities often being their own bureaucratic survival rather than the larger issue of ending a series of horrible acts against humanity,9
504,tt0022100,Being a huge fan of German Expressionist art Im naturally drawn to the films of Fritz Lang  I recently was able to see the restored version of Metropolis on the big screen and was delighted to see M on the Sundance channel  especially since it was the uncut version  M follows the trail of a child killer Peter Lorre sought both by the police and the members of the underworld whose businesses are being effected by the investigation ,8
505,tt0022100,This movie is definitely one of the scariest movies Ive ever seen Its about this childlike pity evoking man brilliantly played by Peter Lorre who also happens to be a psychotic child killer The city in which he lives is of course panicked by the mysterious childkillings and both the criminals and the police starts to haunt the man down I wont reveal more then this but I will say this Just because its an old movie dont let your guard down This movie is one of those rare movies which are so good that youll never forget them,10
506,tt0022100,In an eerie propagandist fashion the phrase in the name of the Law is repeated over the last two scenes of Fritz Langs M as a child killer is brought to justice If L represents the State and the Law then M is meant to represent the Individual who in this case is a Murderer Lang boldly asked us way back in  whose rights come first the State or the Individual? A master of his craft Lang leaves the question openended and lets the audience decideM is shockingly contemporary in its psychological complexities It explores the psychology of individualism vs group think while showcasing how a state of fear can be inflicted upon a populace when a government fails to protect society from a single individual terrorizing the people The story is fairly straightforward An elusive citizen begins killing innocent children in a large nameless German city The media fuels a paranoid frenzy that incites the public The clueless police begin to raid the underworld after the populace is turned into a raving mob because of the failure to capture the killer The underworld comes to a screeching halt as their business is ruined by the police and starts their own manhunt for the killerUnlike a modern period piece that attempts to evoke a certain place and time M WAS a certain place and time Lang in an almost prophetic sense captured the state of mind of the German people in  as the Weimar Republic was on the brink of collapse and the Nazi Regime was preparing to take over When individuals live in a state of fear as they do in M society collapses and the Individual is crushed Only the State it seems can bring orderM is a also a masterpiece for its technical aspects The way in which Lang uses his camera to move through windows capture shadows reflections empty spaces and shift pointsofview is staggering even by todays standards He also played with the new technology of recorded sound with extensive voiceover narration and dialogue used to overlap and transition between scenes Didnt critics recently praise Michael Clayton for utilizing just such a technique as if it was something revolutionary? One can also see a protean style the would eventually birth the Film Noir movement with the creation of tension and suspense in the use of shadows and camera anglesYet M is not perfect It has some major flaws There are no real characters in the film to speak of in the modern sense The film is virtually all built around mood and plot The only time Lang invites us to emotionally connect is in the opening and closing scenes with a mother of one of the victims and in the classic scene of Peter Lorre giving his writhing and primal I cant help it! speech in front of the kangaroo court of criminals The mothers grief and Lorres madness are presented so sparsely and in such a raw form that it becomes too painful to want to connect with them Another flaw that is often overstated about films from this time period is the slow pace of the early police procedural scenes These inherent flaws combined with the inherent brilliance of Langs vision make M one of the most challenging films a modern viewer could ever sit throughWhat impressed me most about M was the subtlety of the symbolism Lang created with his haunting images As harrowing as the story is none of the gruesomeness is shown on screen Its all transmitted to the viewer through the power of suggestion Is it any wonder Hitler wanted Fritz Lang for his propaganda machine which thankfully led to Lang fleeing to America? Ill never forget the wide shots of the kangaroo court and the looks on those peoples faces as the killer is brought down the steps for trial or the vast expanse of that empty warehouse The scene of the ball rolling in the grass with no one to catch it the balloon caught in the telephone wires and the empty domestic spaces the mother has to inhabit after her child has been murdered are the types of scenes that tape into Jungian archetypes and shared fears The look on Lorres face as he confesses the hand of the Law coming down to save Lorre from being lynched and the ghastly plea from the mother in the final scene will stick with me for the rest of my life M is a communal nightmare; one that from which we have yet to awake,10
507,tt0022100,This is one of those movies that will stay with you for the rest of your life  The characters are ugly and disturbing there is nothing cute in this movieThere are constant parallelisms drawn between the police and the underworld and the common way in which they operateWe also get to journey into the mind of the madman  If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs you should see this alsoOf course you must be patient enough to deal with subtitles and the fact that this is a very old movie  one of the first talkies  But most viewers will get something out of the dialogue even without knowing the German language,10
508,tt0022100,Great story with incredible development of ideas and feelings while giving the audience an indepth perspective for each side to an extremely difficult issue to resolve  Every film lover should take the time to see this film for its ingenious style and execution of ideas  Adds a little comedy in interesting ways to help entertain and engage the audience  Acting is incredibly real and heart felt  Dramatic and tender to fit to any interest,0
509,tt0022100,This movie is so intense and enthralling it doesnt have to hide from even the most amazing Actionmovies But unlike the most actionmovies it really has a story to tell with a very interesting conclusion at the endWhen people talk about Fritz Lang they always talk about Metropolis but I think this is his masterpiece This movie MUST HAVE inspired pretty much every police movie or show ever made Rarely have I rated a movie a  with more confidence than this oneEND OF REVIEW so I dont have anymore lines but they make me write  lines apparently so Im writing this I know a joke ehm well its not a good one so I will quote GEORGE BESTI spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars The rest I just squandered,10
510,tt0022100,Watching Fritz Langs M is watching the history of cinema unfold before ones eyes Made in the transition period between the silent and sound film this  masterpiece remains fascinating for several reasonsFirst of all the use of sound is impeccable Suffice to say the killer in the movie is caught is through identifying his trademark whistling But the use of voiceover narration was also new at the time and is used here very well first when a mother calls in panic for her missing child and her name echoes across several empty walls Next in a scene in which two detectives elaborate on what theyve done to apprehend the killer and everything they say is matched by an imageSecondly few times has a serial killer been treated with such complexity compassion and straightforwardness in cinema Peter Lorre plays a child murder a man who acts by impulse possibly a schizophrenic He simultaneously evokes horror and pity and hes too distant from the supercool and erudite serial killers of today Lorre plays one Hans Beckert a lonely man with a history of mental illness an ordinary man without any qualities or amazing traitsThirdly its a powerful meditation on vigilantism and crime The police is unable to capture the killer so Berlins underground decides to capture the criminal The police raids are putting them out of business and they resent the fact that a child killer is being sought amidst their ranks The absurdity of bank robbers and card cheaters with a sense of morals is not lost on the filmmakers In a mocktrial at the end these same criminals think they have the authority to sentence the child murder to death But as he tells them if they wanted if they got jobs and worked honestly they could leave their lives of crime; a man whos ordered by voices to kill cant just turn off him impulsesBut above all M is a fascinating exciting thriller Its an intelligent crime story that shows police and criminals working on different sides and with different means to achieve the same purpose If one can laugh at the idea of a criminal union realism should never be a criterion for judging art one cant laugh at the policemen in this movie Inspector Lohmann played by Otto Wernicke is one of most intelligent detectives ever to grace cinema Hes fat hes cranky hes an unlikely hero but hes shrewd he can read a persons personality at a glance hes patient Lang must have liked him too because he used the character and actor in his following crime epic The Testament of Dr Mabuse in which Lohmann shows even greater skillsI knew or at least highly expected that M would be an amazing movie But I didnt imagine a yearold movie would hold up so well in terms of cinematography sound pacing acting structure Few movies achieve such a synthesis of qualities There is no doubt on my mind that M deserves the recognition it continues to receive from film historians,10
511,tt0022100,In my opinion this is just an OK film Except for some little stylistic tricks there is nothing special The story is OK how it is told is rather weak in some parts its even ridiculous the acting is mostly very weak except for Lorre who you dont see much of anyway and the sound quality is horrible something you cant blame it for but I had to use HEADPHONES on full volume to even understand the words! but switching from sound to silent all the time is very distracting and has no dramatic effect at all even if some say so  the opposite is the case it seems very amateurish The slow pacing is typical for its time And suspense? I dont think so In my opinion the main reasons why this film is so critically acclaimed areA Lorres overacting Whenever overacting has a purpose its critically acclaimed And his acting as a madman is very effective B Id call it heavy look The topic seems heavy and the plot and style seem all too heavy and important You almost want the film to be successful so you search for it in Lorres acting As a justification so to say Im sure you like the film for many other reasons too Some more important reasons maybe But that doesnt mean Im wrong Its a film we want to like and where you dont want to look for the flaws Well long story short I dont think the final result is a success There is too much Average in it and the Great isnt all that great Metropolis Nosferatu Caligari Sunrise I think have all a more stunning look All silent and all made before M Dont get me wrong the cinematography is good and also inventive in little parts but not THAT revolutionary that it deserves the reputation it has Probably the flaws are too big for me to fully appreciate the rest Like every time one said He doesnt leave any marksblah blah I had to laugh He talks with the kids in the middle of the day in the middle of the street he walks along the streets with them he goes into shops buys stuff for them he makes mad gestures in public And then he also whistles this damn song all the time so loud you hear it from three streets away while everyone in the audience knows from beginning on that this will be his doom /,6
512,tt0022100,While many of the problems of early sound pictures lampooned in Singin in the Rain were more or less myths the early talkies did present a big challenge for filmmakers everywhere Europe however was at an advantage over Hollywood because even though it took them a few years to gain the same access to sound technology films from the US would be screened abroad only six months or so after their first domestic release Thus directors like Fritz Lang were able to witness Hollywoods first faltering steps with sound before giving it a go themselvesIts funny how sceptics dismissed sound as a gimmick because the best early uses of sound were those that treated it as exactly that – a gimmick Lang demonstrates in M that a talkie need not be an entirely new kind of motion picture; sound is merely another layer of technique Rather than getting bogged down in lengthy dialogue scenes Lang keeps his storytelling primarily visual and when he needs lots of expository dialogue he intercuts multiple scenes to keep the pace going This is not to say Lang is trying to ignore sound – in fact he uses it to enhance the picture sometimes having dialogue or other noises take place offscreen to focus us on reactions or causeandeffect Other times he ironically uses completely silence something of course you never get with silent pictures due to the continuous musical score giving a dreadful sense of eerinessAnd thankfully the best elements of Langs method have survived the talkie revolution His visual style is particularly effective here in provoking a chilling disturbing atmosphere Shot compositions with large blank areas give a sense of surreal starkness Characters often stare intensely straight at the camera aggressively drawing the audience into the films world Several times we are even dumped straight into the pointofview of the killer himself The fragmented narrative with its lack of lead characters and impersonal pointbypoint plotting could easily be boring but Lang holds our interest by keeping a dynamic sense of rhythm and telling the bulk of the tale through pure wordless imagery Langs German pictures in common with typical German cinema of the time feature highly melodramatic acting and exaggerated almost comical characters These figures generally suited the fantasies and comicbook stories of Langs silent days but Im not sure they sit so well with the closetohome setting of M Still these characters are somewhat more effective now that they have voices probably because most German screen actors of the day were from a stage background Peter Lorre was a shameless ham but thats what you need to play a psychopath and in any case hes a lot better here than in many of his Hollywood roles Otto Wernicke is also incredibly entertaining in the role of Inspector Karl Fatty Lohmann; again a stagy exaggeration but with some absolutely wonderful gestures and comic timingThere isnt a lot else I can say about M – it is one of those pictures that has been analysed to death – although I doubt any comment other than mine mentions Singin in the Rain in the opening line  While not quite Langs best picture I can think of few directors who made such a smooth transition from silents to talkies and sadly this was his penultimate German picture before the Nazis took over Theres no denying that Lang was wasted in Hollywood He did his best to understand it but by and large it never understood him I say by and large; the renowned Irving Thalberg was reportedly bowled over by M and screened it to many of his writers and directors as inspirational material Had that prestigious and influential producer not died in  the same year Lang began working in Hollywood would things have turned out differently I wonder?,9
513,tt0022100,Masterpiece is the word most film buffs and historians probably would use to describe this  Fritz Lange film based loosely on the events of a reallife serial killer a few years prior to the film In this movie the killer is Hans Beckert Peter Lorre who lures children to their deathsThough the story is about a child killer the theme of M centers more on societys obsession with the murders From kids playing games to adults going about their everyday lives everyone is on guard suspicious combative and very vindictive For selfish reasons even the petty criminal underworld wants the child killer caught But the police are ineffective and a selfrighteous mob mentality takes over The whole film is really a study in the terrifying psychology of group thinkAs it turns out the killer is less monstrous than pathetic and compulsive Beckert cant help himself Hes a short squatty bugeyed little man who cant control the devil within Lorre was perfect for the role and his acting is flawless and mesmerizing Yes the killings all offscreen are awful But the militant lynchmob mentality is just as scary Beckert is the only individualist in the filmPart silent film and part talkie the B&amp;W visual style of M is wonderfully expressionistic and baroque There are lots of overhead camera shots Background sounds like honking horns and whistles are precursors of major plot pointsWhat strikes me most about this film is its tone I can think of very few films that are so harsh so bitter so malicious so punitive M contains not an ounce of humanism Langs exwife Thea von Harbou a Nazi sympathizer wrote the film just before the rise of Hitler The films angry militant tone thus foreshadows Hitlers Third Reich from  until  Lang himself fled Germany and ended up in the USYour own personal preferences in films will determine whether you consider M to be a masterpiece or overrated or perhaps somewhere in between But individual preferences aside there can be no doubt that M is an important film historically Every person who wishes to be versed in classic films needs to see M at least once,0
514,tt0022100,A serial killer who favors children Peter Lorre is on the loose in Berlin He is wanted by the police But even worse for him he is wanted by the Berlin underworld who have been targeted falsely by the police for being involved Watch out child killer! There is nothing bad I can say about this film The acting the directing the sound all perfect Many have praised Lang for his use of sound at a time when the practice was just coming into play And rightfully so Whereas other films have sound matching what is on the screen Lang realized he could use the effect to signify what he was not showing including the murderer who has a distinctive whistle Brilliant Not to mention that one key role is a blind beggar a man who cannot appreciate visuals but only sounds he is appropriately the man who can identify the killer! Basing the story loosely off of childmurderers of the day Grossman Haarman and Peter Kürten this is one of the darkest tales set to film up to this point There is no blood and no children are actually seen killed And the killer is relatively reserved compared to his reallife counterparts who were also rapists and cannibals He presents an interesting defense his crimes are less wrong than the crimes of others because he cannot psychologically control himself Or in modern terms not guilty by reason of mental defect Is a child killer less evil than a pickpocket? Is he in some way also a victim?I enjoyed the idea of a unionized underworld I do not know the reality of this as it seemed sort of comic and anticipated such villainous teamups as we might see in comic books But crime was certainly not unheard of and even black market meat existed and I am not sure if I really want to know what that meansMany including reviewer Stanley Kauffmann have noticed the similarity between M and Bertolt Brechts Threepenny Opera Sadly I have not seen Brechts work and cannot comment on the comparison German philosopher Theodor Lessing best known for his work on Jewish selfhatred may even have been an inspiration due to his work on Haarmann But regardless of inspiration Lang is the master here his work stands the test of time and today almost a century later is widely recognized as one of the greatest achievements on film At the least many consider it the alltime greatest German film And rightfully soThere are so many great shots including the socalled inventory shot of the criminal underworlds wares Lang also excelled with the camera angles using knives as frames and getting more than one great mirror shot I should also give credit to cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner who previously worked on Nosferatu and many others  his reputation should be second only to Karl FreundThere is nothing that beats the Criterion release with commentary short films and more I watched the film this way on DVD Perhaps a Bluray release has even more but I would not even know what could be added This disc is packed and a mustown for any film historian or Lang fan,10
515,tt0022100,Outstanding German expressionist film from Fritz Lang that follows first the police then the underworld as they search for a child killer in Berlin The cinematography is moody and dramatic as the story moves through the poorer sections of the great city and the acting while of a more melodramatic style than is currently popular is very good* Peter Lorre is outstanding as the killer who taunts the police as the noose slowly tightens around him To some extent the film is an early procedural drama as the police use then modern forensic techniques such as finger printing and graphology to try and find the killer Tired of the increased police surveillance the citys criminal element begins their own search mobilising the numerous beggars to be eyes on the street The film touches on a number of issues that are as relevant now as in the s including mob mentality men are accused of being the killer simply for talking to a child rights of the accused the end justifies the means use of torture and the ever thorny issue of mental health and culpability One of the great preWWII German films *I watched a subtitled version on TCM,10
516,tt0022100,M like Manichean? What can you say of a plot driven by criminals and where good people are rather inefficient for the most part and where the most despicable character earns our own sympathy This is a movie using such stark blackandwhite contrasts noir in its soul and gray in its coreM like Mob Mentality? Fritz Lang personal Jaccuse against a system where accusers arent all innocentM like Maturity? The film also consecrates German Expressionism as a peak of creativity and social relevance a sequence in history where Berlin became literally the best area and arena of expression to an art that had reached its maturityOr M like Mörder murderer in German Maudit in French doomed and Masterpiece in the universal language of cinemaM like Menace and MusicChildren are singing an elimination game of ominous undertones later we see little Elsie playing with the balloon a shadowy silhouette appears the face remains unrevealed while we hear the whistling of In the Hall of Mountain King Before the shark theme in Jaws to the Psycho shrieking violins the Peer Gynt tune became the first notable leitmotif meant to suggest an evil presence the perfect device to put us in the victims standpoint for the first act as powerlessly as the poor mother calling Elsie while her balloon the bait used by Hans Beckert is drifting along the telephone wiresThe effects are then shown through the growing fame of the new Jack the Ripper figure the ensuing paranoia with any adult basically talking to a child is assaulted The killer is a menace to an already crisisstricken society forcing the police department to triple the efforts psychiatric cases are explored handwriting analyzed and daily and nightly raids operated to make further pressure on the criminal worldM for Methodic For its second act M is the seminal police proceduralWhile covering that angle with a documentarylike precision Lang still seems dubious about the polices efficiency and provides an interesting twist by paralleling the work of the law with the outlaws In a long sequence where both sides brainstorm about the methods to use to find him we swing back and forth from one world to another and the only indicator of the side of the law were put in is the presence of uniform last time I saw criminals acting like politicians in a masterpiece it was in The Godfather One even points out insightfully that the killer must be a bourgeois because its the very standard of life that provides the level of idleness driving any easily corruptible mind to the most extreme cornersM like the sign on the shoulderSo in a famous sequence criminals helped by the street beggars find Hans Beckert quicker than the police force he was betrayed by his trademark whistling and irony a little girl who noticed the infamous letter marked on his shoulder The following chase takes maybe too much time for the films own good Not saying the film could do without the struggle to catch him but the court is such a high point of cinemas history that the previous part seems more forgettableAnd Peter Lorre with his round face innocent eyes when hes cornered like a rat and utters his memorable speech gives the performance of a lifetime as a living symptom a man incarnating the sickness of a society where bad people toy with justice and the worst of all acts as childishly as his victims claiming innocence with such rabid eloquence hes almost convincingBeckert says he cant control his impulses a little voice urges him to commit the irreparable acts and his body language is simply gutwrenching when he simply cant put words His lawyer makes a good point about the past of some accusers whose Becket call hypocrites because they could choose to be honest but the accusers retort that whether hes responsible or not hes still a menace Sure whether their reasons are selfish or ethical is debatable but can we empathize with Beckert?M like ModernityLooking at Twitter or Youtube or Facebook comments today you can tell theres something ferocious and still ongoing about mob mentality and a film like M could be deemed as feeble and liberal in the way it provides a tribune to a child molester the worst possible crimeM like MultilayeredYet there are some powerful truths hiding underneath the thriller the truth about a society sick of its own contradictions determined to impose standards of morality white and condemning true crimes black but indulgent toward activities that have no worse repercussion That the film ends with blackclad mothers admitting their own responsibility is perhaps the most optimistic thing about M the sentence doesnt matter what matters is the lesson behind but did German learn the lesson?Ironically one could have seen the rise of the Nazi empire as the antidote like Thea Von Sarbou who wrote the film and worked for the Nazi regime other could also see it as its worst possible consecration like director Fritz Lang That he didnt side with the criminals at the end emphasizes an intuitive comprehension of his world and allowed this film to be hailed as a true intelligent nightmarish and alas premonitory masterpiece with M as the mark of a disillusioned geniusM like Meditative? Mysterious? Mantic?Interestingly the French title is M le Maudit meaning the doomed one as if Beckert was the living incarnation of a doomed society as if there was indeed something rotten in the Weimar Republic and It wouldnt get any better after but could Fritz Lang anticipate it? Looking up his second masterpiece M I was wondering whether Lang reflected his own rejection of German society or cared enough to warn the audience against the impending doom of decadenceSurely the director behind Metropolis could only pinpoint with the accuracy of a soothsayer the limits of a civilization that might take its heritage for granted,9
517,tt0022100,This movie has it all! This is one of my alltime favorite movies Many people have criticized it because its from  and I say Who cares when you have such a great movie? Peter Lorre gives a  star performance as the child murderer and may I say he is very very haunting Fritz Langs direction is superb; the cinematography is superb! The kangaroo court scene at the end is my favorite part and its brilliantly done The plot is very well crafted Even more amazing is the plot focuses around catching the murderer but it is not boring for one second Each scene flows beautifully into the next with some amazing chases raids and facial expressions This is also a movie ahead of its time This is definitely one of the alltime best movies!,10
518,tt0022100,Fritz Langs second absolute landmark after the equally brilliant but completely different Metropolis and also his first opportunity to work with the wonders of sound And boy did he ever deliver a great piece of work! Like the M for murderer is marked on Peter Lorres coat the film M for masterpiece is branded on cinema history annals for all eternity Langs film is a triumph in every possible viewpoint and it covers a lot more genres and elements than just simply the manhunt for a childmolester*** SPOILERS ****The horrors M handles about is timeless and of all cultures but yet itll always remain a taboo subject and for that reason alone Fritz Lang deserves extra praising In an utterly astonishing way Peter Lorre portrays Hans Beckert a child murderer who singlehandedly terrorizes four and half million people simply by his uncontrollable urge to kidnap and molest young schoolgirls The grim and haunting atmosphere is terrifically built up by images of previous Beckertvictims and the disappearance a new unfortunate girl Her toy rolling of a remote hillsa balloon drifting away on the wind Really simple but extremely efficient methods to reflect the ominous actions that just took place Other than to focus on the further actions of the killer Lang turns to the effect this terror has on the city and how the manhunt for Beckert develops Our director is obviously fascinated by how a police procedure is organized and he serves the viewer a detailed overview of all the steps taken by the investigators Meanwhile he grabs the opportunity to forcefully criticize the medias influence and the German law system with both hands Id really like to stress that Langs subtle mockery was a really risky thing to do with the upcoming Nazireign so you cant admire him enough Due to the constant and fruitless raids the police are holding in the hope to capture the killer the criminal underworld begins to lose its profits as well and they start their own manhunt for the killer assisted by whores beggars and petty thieves With the carefully observing eyes all over town it becomes practically impossible for Becker to satisfy his monstrous needs The almighty Peter Lorre arrives late in the film every moment hes on screen is a moment worth treasuring His sad appearance and cruel testimony are sequences that leave no human being unmoved Lorre is a brilliant actor and this is inarguably one of the most impressive performances of all time M features constant tension outstanding dialogue and stunning camerawork As said before Fritz Lang had the opportunity to work with sound for this film and he immediately makes the most out of this This was the first big German production that featured sound and it STILL ranks as the title that made best use of itand that sure means something after more than  years Theres the chilling and legendary tune Lorre constantly whistles but also the absence of sound Lang uses to portray the besieged city As you can tell from the above review M is absolute mustsee and easily one of the most essential productions ever shot Its lightyears ahead of its time and still disturbing after all these years This film is a mesmerizing portrait about the darkest most alarming aspects of humanity and yet still it doesnt live up to reallife facts As you probably know the plot of M is based on the whereabouts of the serial killer Peter Kürten who brutally murdered many victims in the city of Düsseldorf I read a biography on Kürten recently and the true details of his crimes and animallusts go beyond every filmmakers wildest imagination,10
519,tt0022100,Since I loved Metropolis and was mesmerized by the great storyline of M I happily shelled out  euros to get the deluxe DVDset of Fritz Langs first talkie fully expecting I was going to view it over and over againWell that was  euros I should have spent on a new haircut or something This is a very boring film one that is only somewhat redeemed by a great Peter Lorre and an interesting final scene But the first hour was sooo slooow! Low point was a tenminute scene in which four boring men were having a roundtable about deciding what to do about the child killer No camera movement whatsoever just blabbering and no oneliners either Hes a killer for heavens sake  ACTION! DO SOMETHING! STOP HIM! Looking back maybe I was even more mesmerized by the brand M The film posters are great and that single M just makes for a classic even harrowing logoStill I honestly cant believe that a modern viewer would actually enjoy this,4
520,tt0022100,From the elongated opening scene of M you know you are in for more than a simple film could ever imagine The elongated lunch scene as a mother waits for her daughter to return as we audience members watch the daughter stray from her journey home with a stranger with a sharpened whistle It is foreboding it is depressing it is mesmerizing It has been a very long time since a film especially one made  years ago seemed so delicate so thought provoking so timeless as M does From these opening shots Lang lets us know that this isnt going to be your happy utopia where criminals are caught the next day by the police and our world goes back to liquorish and lollipops but instead a world where the locals collect like a mob and trust is thrown violently out of the window With excellent cinematography and a strong balance between humor and honesty Lang creates this visceral world where the line between truth and justice get blurred where good and evil are similar and a man defines his actions as uncontrollable This merely scratches the surface of M a masterful film that ranks amongst the best this world has offeredWhat makes M shoot ahead of anything modern anything by cult directors anything close to popular? It begins with the actors goes to the man behind the camera and finally the skillful craftsmanship of the story Each of these elements never lack never fall behind and constantly build upon each other until that final breath that encourages you to repetitively rewatch To begin Peter Lorre How could you not talk about M without mentioning this doeeyed murderer From the beginning we know his role in this film yet Lang pulls every emotion out of us as we follow his route We feel sympathy for Lorre when he is tried we feel scared when he is trapped in the attic we feel hatred when he voyeuristically looks at the children  and yet he isnt the only character in this film Lang introduces us to other well placed personas throughout The infamous Inspector Lohmann not to mention that great floorup shot is the perfect example of Langs impressions on the local German police The fact that Lohmann whistles counter productive to what Lorre represents only solidifies that idea To add to these already dynamic people we have the background criminals that decide to take the matter into their own hands in hopes to eliminate the looming police presence The Safecracker is idealistic of what Germany was to become the classic SS look with the idea of eliminating the opportunity to be tried in a true court of law Each one of these characters provide humor excitement and fullblown emotion to the screen adding to the overall impact to this film With Lorre already bedazzling us with his range and taut emotion it is up to Fritz Lang himself to ensure that edits angles and direction doesnt hinder the power of his actors Lang steps up to the plate and delivers with his avantgarde film making I use the words avantgarde because the techniques used in this film are far beyond  Lang incorporates powerful closeups amazing track following and shots nearly unseen at this time The overhead shots the ability to make the crowds look ravenous the camera puns adds just as much as another lead would If you were impressed by his ability in Metropolis M is only going to solidify that idea of Lang A favorite is the raid on the office complex by a group of criminals Every shot every detail is directed with ease but complexity It is easy to be in awe of this film but to take the time to see Langs ability behind the camera will take M to a whole new level Personally it is my belief that he announces himself with this film A pioneer of the camera a grandfather of what cinema is today  one cannot watch anything released today and not see Langs influences See Finchers Zodiac a nearly identical film in themes to what Lang was trying to produce hereFinally we have acting and direction but one must also credit the story for being not just creative and unflinchingly original but for supporting a strong message The idea of being more careful was impressive to watch due to the time being  a time well thought of that children could be anywhere without any worry The story brings evil into an American thought that good guys always prevail that suburbia is always safe and that the police actually do keep the streets safe The story of M challenges you as a viewer even today one could argue even more so today than in  With crimes continually on the rise in this country with the idea that pleading insanity cures the disease of murder or is an easy innocence the idea of M especially that final dialogue seems more important today The fascination also arises with the concept of the mob within this story  the horror that simple events kindness even could turn on anyone in a moment of panic Police arresting anyone that even looks at children in a peculiar way  a fascinating concept that Lang is not afraid to develop Imagine if this film were made two years later what a different theme Lang would have tackledA deeply enticing film Fritz Lang proves that he was a ground breaker in his field Not only could he handle Science Fiction but nearly every other genre imaginable M is no exception to his skill If you have not seen this film watch it  experience it  know what it means to be marked like Lorre Grade ***** out of *****,10
521,tt0022100,Im a fan of Peter Lorres and I love black &amp; white films  I enjoy foreign films  I even like trying to twist my brain around mindboggling symbolfilled convoluted art flicks  But I was incredibly disappointed in *M*It had a lot of potential but it kept drowning in itself  It took me a while to understand this  The plot itself wasnt overly complex  so why did I still have the feeling of unpleasant confusion  What I finally realized is that *M*s downfall is that it cant decide what it isI went into it with a general understanding of what it was going to be about and knowing Peter Lorres work I had certain expectations  The parts of the movie that were most satisfying to me were those which fit those expectations a tense shadowy atmosphere made all the more eerie and suspenseful by the skillful use of In the Hall of Mountain KingOther parts of the movie felt more like a police procedural  There is certainly a place for the Ed McBains of our world but that place is not being mixed in with Robyn Cook  These segments felt out of place and they jarringly interrupted the mood created by the spookier more emotionally taut scenesThe muchapplauded ending had the same problem for me it suddenly introduced yet another mood  that of introspection and social consciousness  This was too distinct from either of the other two moods to feel as if it were even part of the same pictureEach mood each theme each general strain could have been very good on its own  but as a package the film felt illblended  And as much as I enjoy paradox and even confusion they are not in of themselves sufficient criteria for a good film,3
522,tt0012349,While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplins later features The Kid is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicelyWhile its a fairly simple story this is one of Chaplins most efficiently designed movies  Every scene either is necessary to the plot or is very funny for its own sake or both  Except for Chaplin and Coogan most of the other characters even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance are just there to advance the plot when needed and the two leads are allowed to carry the show which they both do extremely wellThe Kid is also impressive in that while the story is a sentimental one it strikes an ideal balance maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies  Here the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorableThis is one of Chaplins very best movies by any measure  If you enjoy silent comedies dont miss it,0
523,tt0012349,Ive always thought theres a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies even unsentimental ones like Keatons The General or Laurel and Hardys Way Out West The latter comedy has a scene where L&amp;H perform a softshoe dance; it always brings me to tears Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that Im laughing doesnt dilute the emotional chargeOne of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already Why not marry the two things? Thats what he did in some of his early short films and thats what he does in this feature comedy The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie Jackie Coogan away Meanwhile the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesnt know if shell ever find out what became of himJackie Coogan about five in this film with his charming manners his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy is one of the alltime great child actors Want more evidence of Chaplins genius? Coogan doesnt steal the film from him This is true even though Chaplin as producer star and director makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boys talents Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles like My Boy and Oliver TwistChaplins storytelling—even with the foolish subDickensian plot twists such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed The windowbreaking scene the flophouse scene the dream sequence the tryingtogetridofthebaby scene—theyre perfect Chaplins celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselvesWant me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know I cant even complain about that Its too sweetly naïve And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the very few flawsOne important note children love this movie Show it to them while theyre young and youll make Chaplin fans of them And thats better than their becoming fans of almost anything thats being peddled to them,0
524,tt0012349,Wow is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so That fact that it still entertains over  years after it was made is quite a testimony It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama Charlie Chaplins unique humor combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember Chaplins humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stuntsThe kid  Jackie Coogan  is just as memorable maybe even more so He is unbelievably cute especially in those oldtime clothes he wore Watching the expressions on his face even as a baby are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent eraSo between Chaplin and Coogan and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next its an amazing piece of work This is a very fastpaced story which lasts less than an hourThe special edition twodisc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear actually astounding for its age Excellent entertainment,9

in movies on his own becoming Hollywoods first important child starTHE KID starts off with intertitles A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear followed by The woman whose sin was motherhood titles much to the liking of a DW Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish yet in fact might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplins whose very name personifies comedy A young girl Edna Purviance leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father Carl Miller a young artist never returns to her life The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away Crooks enter the scene stealing the car discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket

to perfection has one difficult scene that comes off naturally this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as hes lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot a substitute for a baby bottle back into his mouth Another classic moment on a serious nature is when Charlie is being held back by authorities being forced to watch his crying son taken away from him Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as hes being chased by a policeman from the slanted rooftops The closeup where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on filmChaplin and little Jackie billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin right down to his baggy pants Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances is so convincing that it doesnt take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp From this point onward he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor at the same time adding more plot pathos and truly great comedy routinesAs much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that followsTHE KID which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years was resurrected in the s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in  It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in  as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection double billed along with a comedy short THE IDLE CLASS  In the DVD format the two disc set includes rare outtakes and deleted scenes Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library where it made its debut December   during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights hosted by Robert Osborne and later in March  when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its Star of the MonthFor its age THE KID holds up extremely well thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan Theres no doubt Jackie Coogan  became an overnight star with this one film He was a natural While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again on screen anyway without them there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID ****,10
526,tt0012349,The Kid is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplins oeuvre Chaplin hadnt filled a film so fully with pathos since The Vagabond  and then it was in a very limited way subject to the confines of tworeel length Additionally Sunnyside  was a failure The feature length of The Kid also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags pranks and set pieces and with the support of Jackie Coogan its one of his funniest comediesThe parentchild relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment and for me not many have neared Chaplin in exploiting that formula in The Kid The sequence where they take the kid for a workhouse away from the tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the filmor of all film In addition to Chaplin and Coogan Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture Furthermore Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totherohs photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist but the musical score added to the  release composed by Chaplin taken from Tchaikovsky gives the sentimental parts its most verveOf the slapstick one of my favorite scenes involves the tramp in fear of a bully Its reminiscent of his Mutual short Easy Street  which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film Yet The Kid is much more than that which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplins previous work This was the beginning of the tramp as the sympathetic pitiful hero as well as clown thats so recognizable and beloved to this dayMoreover the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect Its also funny in a silly way Its somewhat analogous to the outer reality story although with much ambiguity I wasnt always sure Chaplin was making any clear point such as with the Christ image earlier in the film but that seems unimportant; The Kid affects the emotions and isnt especially aimed at engaging the mind At six reels with more sets and a developed plot this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplins previous films; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth thus making The Kid Chaplins first complete feature,9
527,tt0012349,It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as The Kid It is a silent movie but so rich winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words Chaplin and year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness And I really never cry in movies And the musicits simply Oscarlevel! The movie is sympathetic full of feeling touchingly funny moments It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over  years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age don´t miss it,10
528,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous His character the Tramp is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early th century but something all of us can overcomeIn one of his first roles with this character he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family Taking himself and this very talented young boy Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote directed starred in and composed the score for this filmHere Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own He hasnt got much but he does have love which is more than can be said for the childs motherFlash forward five years and now the mother wants her son back Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion Even so the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks things not used much at the time in the movies Using these little tricks and ideas Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the storyHowever at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh sometimes in the same scene This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it,8
529,tt0012349,Is there a way to name the greatest filmmaker of all time? Probably not to different people its gonna be different person so I can speak only for myself Let me try to describe my favorite contestant for this award,0
530,tt0012349,Its easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius but Ill say it once again the man was a genius if only at doing a certain particular kind of film You wouldnt ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film or at least one like out of Germany or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the s and s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and the usual kickedaround word manipulated amid the comedic setups Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the KidAs it stands even at  minutes which was trimmed by Chaplin himself  years after its original release and including a new musical score its just about a perfectly told tale It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that Dreamland sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful lightanddark examination of all the major characters in the picture now with angel wings and devil horns! What its about in complete basics is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she wont be able to take care of him and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at and the Tramp decides to take care of him he even names him in one amusing aside John Then it cuts to  years later and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows eat lots of pancake and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an Older Brother of a kid John gets in a fight with Meanwhile the mother is now a success not knowing her child is somewhere right in front of her noseThis may sound like a bit of story but its told briskly and without a missed beat in editing and Chaplins reedit tightens it to a point where were mostly with the Kid and the Tramp Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be playful absurd cute and bittersweet to a degree We know this cant exactly last but the moment the poor maybesick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic and yet partially triumphant sequences in the movies Its in a case like this where we as the audience tear up more or less as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out and then intercut with Chaplins daring dash across the rooftops to save him that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film silent or otherwise; that its silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true even a beat with the Kid playing with toys an obviously cute bit is great and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like ChaplinFeaturing some excellent setpieces just unto themselves aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that bellylaugh part with the repetitive brickhit to the head or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin and excellent performances from all supporting cast including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance its altogether an aweinspiring feat To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness,10
531,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid the cute little Jackie Coogan has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos and true to what you would expect of his best work does it superbly  The tramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding a little boy to the mix was the finishing touch  Look out too for little Lita Grey in the angel sequence who would become Chaplins nd wife four years after this film was made,0
532,tt0012349,What makes a feature film different to a short? It isnt just length After all some of Charlie Chaplins later shorts were as long as fortyfive minutes while The Kid is barely an hour No when Chaplin made his graduation to fulllength features he also strove to broaden the scope scale and above all the dignity of his work The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplins careerThe Kid begins with a bit of backstory as a few of Chaplins shorts do but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this Here we have the opening of a drama and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief Of course such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short but here that wouldnt be appropriate Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laughoutloud funny but they certainly dont belong in a straight dramatic setting And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room sceneAnd never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration but still very natural by the standards of the time And of course little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive his movements expressions and timings all spoton so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness and he appears more like a human cartoon character Coogan steals the picture with ease and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously asideThis too is an important difference with The Kid Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act famously severing his partnership with the funnyinhisownright Ben Turpin back in  Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own The few examples such as the routine with the policemans wife and the window ledge are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material However he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this outToday The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful featurelength spinoff If you look at something like the minute Christmas special of The Office it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode Chaplins full length features however were far more than just spinoffs and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work,9
533,tt0012349,The Kid became a critically hailed international hit A tramp Charles Chaplin brings up an abandoned baby Jackie Coogan and later loses him to his mother Edna Purviance; but there is a happy endingThe film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums The comedy is sparingly laid on but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest The production is comparatively smooth young Coogan is sensational and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced His inspiration it is suggested was the death of his own first son Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in ,10
534,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins first full length feature film and his biggest success up to that date is a remarkably heartwarming story  which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy It begins with a woman whos sin was motherhood who gives birth to a baby she cant support at a Charity Hospital which is kept padlocked from the inside She is forced to abandon it in an alley and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film as he is casually strolling by and then through a series of odd but entirely believable situations he is unable to get rid of it It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin who was in top form playing the little boy at  years old Charlies life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplins traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed dramatic story The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments sometimes simultaneously if you can believe that but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival and it is never once predictable all the way until the last frameThere is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy and in between rounds  Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well and giving him hints for the rest of the fight Meanwhile the other kids brother shows up a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankensteins monster than anything else What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street This is a slapstick setup that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time were it not for its direct relevance to the storyAt another point there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home as the  version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackies arms I think this is the only time in any film that Ive ever seen genuine lowbrow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident This combination not just here but throughout the film is The Kids biggest achievement There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about although my understanding is that volumes have been written about its symbolic meaning both within the movie and in reference to Chaplins personal life And speaking of which supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing I dont know which story to believe that it was because of Chaplins painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary I would bet its a little of both but the film is here and I guess ultimately thats all that matters In the five or six times that Ive seen The Kid I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramps real son either on screen or off Then again I am looking at it with st century eyes Some of Shirley Temples early films are also a little disturbing to me although for not quite the same reasons By this time Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films and after  short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond along with a few assorted others Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema,10

536,tt0012349,The simple lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch Id say that it is as much funny as sad and the music score couldnt be more accuratePerhaps the most delightful surprise was to In the dreamland scene So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated the scene made me question myself if at the moment I was watching Buñuel and not Chaplin It is not my Chaplins favorite but its for sure one of his bests Totally recommend to be watched Chaplin will never disappoint you thats for sure If you watch this one also with City Lights and Modern Times youll be ready to enjoy his talkies The Great Dictator a classic and the perfect touching till tears Limelight,9
537,tt0012349,Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five yearsIn reading Charlie Chaplins memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him The second thing was Chaplins determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be doneThe success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they dont totally steal the film from youThe Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid Hes the same rapscallion Tramp we all know but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp one of deep feeling and protectiveness Two people who need and love each other very much This film couldnt missFirst National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin the studio and his estranged wife Mildred Harris The Robert Downey Jr biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itselfTill that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid,9
538,tt0012349,The Kid was released in  at the pinnacle of the Silent era when emotions came to screen through looks and body language when we didnt need dialog we had faces And if theres one film where Charlie Chaplins face oddly illuminates the screen its definitely The Kid Sure many fans would argue that City Lights is Chaplins masterpiece but something is too perfect too masterfully directed it was made during the talking era Chaplin was in his s and had more experience while The Kid features a more youthful director It belongs to a whole other era and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed in  Chaplin was  Hitchcock  Brando wasnt even born discovering The Kid is like turning the pages of a dusty yellowpaged historical book one eye is watching the film while the other discovers a period And I dont know if Im the only one but theres something in the setting the location that makes the film look even older For all I saw the movie could have been set in the early century and considering the timing of the film maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin himself The film was made in a difficult personal time when hed just lost his son after his birth There was a great wound in Chaplins heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragementThe context of The Kid is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time which is even more impressive considering his sevenyear experience a short time but enough to create an icon the Little Tramp an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema Chaplins story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and Im sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame  and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a filmmakerThe Emigrant in  was like the first step back into Chaplins past inspired by his own experience The movie doesnt feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future and leaving the motherland wasnt synonym of sadness but the emotions were there beyond the slapstick and the comedy and waiting for another step back to finally explode in an emotional firework which directly transports us to Chaplins past He who grew up without a father and started working at an early age he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living before it cemented his talent he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin And this is how The Kid was made and for the first time Chaplin would become more than a simple clown and get all the respect he needed from his peers as a gifted filmmaker He could finally make his first masterpiece The Gold Rush but The Kid was this necessary last breath before taking the big diveMany aspects of The Kid highlight Chaplins past and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs  a woman abandons a child expecting him to be adopted by a rich family until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramps arms But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who despite the archetypal situations didnt make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt as is the father a nicelooking fellow and a sign that Chaplin doesnt hold any grief against his father These things happen and we shouldnt feel sorry as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos  the Tramp and the KidIn every aspect the Kid is Chaplins alter ego  hes smart tender funny sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing Weve seen so many child performances since  to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is and Jackie Coogan is one of the best if not the best almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy and that the kid didnt become as much a star as Chaplin is one of cinemas cruelest ironies The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense closeups on Chaplins face  his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen and whatever inhabits the Tramps heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himselfChaplin like Disney for animation handled drama with the same strength as for comedy the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy fun cheers and even some dreamy escapism allowing a selfreflexive approach of the magic of childhood The Kid is not perfect but its a masterpiece of sincerity of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music If not his best its his most defining film ,9
539,tt0012349,This is such a incredible movieAlong with City Lights and The Gold Rush this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin and it is also one of the best movies ever madeIt is true that for the modern viewers the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the boxofficeThat doesnt mean this movie isnt entertaining In fact I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny comedies and also way more emotional and engagingI truly loved this film It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldnt be forgotten,10
540,tt0012349,The opening title to this film reads A film with a smile  and perhaps a tear Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken for Charlie Chaplins The Kid has a plethora of smiles from start to finish and yes a few tears as well The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character played by Chaplin The Tramp takes the baby into his own care Five years go by and the Tramp and the Kid portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan are getting along just fine However a turn of events results in the two being separated and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his sonCharlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking and this film is one of his best His direction is truly remarkable being able to manipulate the audiences emotions so much without sound He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget He manages to make you laugh almost nonstop from start to finish and even wind up causing you to shed a tear Its so emotionally gripping and you just fall in love with these characters from the getgo Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinemaAs emotionally wrenching this film is its simply hilarious This film has some great slapstick humor and Chaplin is a true master of it Jackie Coogan is also great If I had to find one flaw with the film it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I dont really mind it despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film Overall The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute then tug at your heartstrings the next Its an absolute riot but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema Ive ever seen And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue its just incredible And not to mention the music is just stellar too Chaplin is a master at composition The Kid is one of my favorite films and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!,10
541,tt0012349,When watching this I wanted to give the film a  rather than an  simply because I do not think it is as good as Modern Times or one or two others However taking into account that this is  and the film technology is not all there I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done it could have been made a decade later and looked the sameChaplin has to of course be given a lot of credit for producing writing directing and starring Being a great comic actor is one thing but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid and they nailed it  hes adorable emotional and seems able to handle any situation,8
542,tt0012349,The worlds most famous tramp is back and this time he has kid sidekick! Sounds kind of gimmicky right? But it works perfectly! Chaplin and child actor Jackie Coogan work extremely well together Their scenes are filled with heart and you can see that they both enjoyed themselves during the making of the movie The movie has the signature Chaplin slapstick that is guaranteed to have you in stitches but it also has some genuinely sad and emotional moments making this movie one of Chaplins most fondly remembered from his gigantic and legendary filmography,10

545,tt0012349,They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but Im not so sure anymore There has been a generational discontinuity at least in the USA that seems to have happened about  or  years ago I suspect that most people over the age of  could identify Charlie Chaplin and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinctionGenerally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation but Jackie Coogan is an exceptionSentimental manipulation there is but its mainly limited to one or two scenes The comedy is pretty acerbic Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again Thats not what passes for sentimentalityBesides Coogan is cute when hes  or  years old a ragamuffin dressed in floppy oversized bags of clothing so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it And the kid can act tooCharlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him which was all he had to do Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because hes too inexperienced to know how to overact Chaplain is good too of course How could one person be so inventive? Its said that TV eats up talent because of the constant demand for new material One of the better series Twilight Zone had about three good years of collaborative effort in it Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in  films and directed something like  of them and he was just getting startedIll give one example of a joke without an iota of sentiment in it to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid a big bully who knocks him about Chaplain spots this interrupts the fight and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing  go for the belly keep your guard up  and sends him back into the fight At this point the bullys hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says If your boy beats my boy Im going to beat you Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bullys chin and flattens him But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back Chaplain dashes over puts his foot on the Coogans chest to hold him down quickly counts to ten rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand  the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy Youll enjoy it Especially if youre one of those rare folks under  with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue,0
546,tt0012349,A picture with a smile and perhaps a tearThat is the first line of the movie as it begins and it stands true We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling Wow I cant say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story Now we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally recent great movie is Finding Nemo But whats special about this movie is simplicty honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into usDone by the genius Chaplin there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling we either smile or bring tears So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do are done there Winning over a fight from a neighbour meeting angels and all Now look at the editing in this less than an hour film its neat and precise The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film Acting is sublime by Chaplin only few can do what he did and even today hardly anyone can match him Its a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch atlas watch it before you die you may learn something you never wanted to miss Its / for one of the finest silent movies ever,10
547,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is one of Chaplins best films as well as one of his most famous It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by and its not hard to see why Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector a young miner during the gold rush After getting caught in a storm he hurries to the only shelter that he can find a wood cabin in the middle of the storm It turns out that it is already inhabited and by a tough criminal named Black Larson no less and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim another prospector insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film,10
548,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is pure gold  It was Charlie Chaplins third featurelength film and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris  which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp  This movie should be counted among Chaplins best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights which Ive also seen as THE best Chaplin movie but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedys immortal geniusesHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV I saw it again in October  as part of my colleges silentfilm class on a poorquality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen ,10
549,tt0015864,Charles Chaplins The Gold Rush is arguably his finest film He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich What he does not realize is that he may find love in the form of Georgia Hale instead of money In the end that may be all right with him The Gold Rush shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer writer and director he was Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the th Century Chaplin showed humanity love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career The movie is exceptional in every way Although I am not as wellversed with movies from the s as I am with the decades following it I would still probably call The Gold Rush the finest film of that year period Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today  stars out of ,0
550,tt0015864,The  Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious As an unnamed prospector Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner the dancing roles and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff His companion Big Jim McKay Mack Swain at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplins character to be a chicken and before long a bear enters their cabin In the midst of it all the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia Georgia HaleA real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!,10
551,tt0015864,To see Charlie Chaplins The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment One cannot help but enjoy a film as welldone as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered and I can see why It is a masterful blend of comedy drama and romance among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture Like all great movies The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramps flawless physical comedy He was a master of comedic timing and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians Ive ever seen Dont get me wrong this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler The film moves along at a brisk pace following the misadventures of our hero The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin of course as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska Along his journey through the elements the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen Tom Murray a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold Fortunately our friend also comes across a fellow prospector Big Jim McKay Mack Swain who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich But the Lone Prospectors adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere When he is forced back to civilization he falls in love with Georgia Georgia Hale the most beautiful girl in town Of course it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite the handsome ladys man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia as well Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the egomaniacal lady killer All of this would be too much for any one of us but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie I am a fan of Charlie Chaplins movies but as objective as I can possibly be this IS one of the great moviesEssential viewing!,10
552,tt0015864,This silent classic has many strong points  it has a lot of humor interesting characters a good story and good settings  Its the kind of film that shows how much a master filmmaker can communicate in a silent movie  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion but other than that its a fine filmChaplin himself plays the Lone Prospector and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors rickety cabins plus some other good materialThe version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin reedited in the s adding his own narration and deleting the title cards which gives it a slightly different feel  These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who arent used to silent films You can tell from Chaplins narration how fond he must have been of The Gold Rush and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art,0
553,tt0015864,Charlie Chaplins silent film also rereleased with a narration in the early s focuses as usual on the Little Tramp and in this case his attraction to a chorus girl Georgia Hale This is the one where he eats a boot along with its laces and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rollsThe role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin Lita Grey but her pregnancy ruled her out Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions Mack Swain appears as Big Jim who shares a cabin with the Tramp at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and goldrunners as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time as a sound film it is fairly good,8
554,tt0015864,Ive seen both version of this filmthe original silent version from  and the rerelease by Chaplin in the s The difference is that the rerelease was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies To do this title cards were removedhaving Chaplin narrate the film In addition Chaplincreated music for the most partsome were classical pieces sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVDit has both plus excellent DVD extras Otherwise there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out theremany with terrible quality prints or music or both The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the  rereleaseI use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film though I might in the future use it for my Psychology classes as well I teach both because Chaplins genius came from his obsessivecompulsive nature The movie reportedly had  times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than  takes!! The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century Along the way he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb Suffice to say the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch something not true of all fulllength slapstick comediessometimes their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to fulllengthThis is a gorgeous wellexecuted piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac The musical score arranged by Chaplin direction acting and cinematography all are simply perfectmaking this in my opinion the best fulllength silent comedy ever made This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keatons films!,10
555,tt0015864,If any single figure can fairly be said to symbolize the glory years of the silent filmsthe cinemas truly international epochit is Charles Chaplins indomitable tramp The Little Fellow as millions came to call him was at once tatty and debonair browbeaten and irrepressibly optimisticand he was without question the bestloved international star in all of film history His coat was too small his pants too large his mustache patently falseand the resultant silhouette instantly recognizable wherever movies were shown Charlie Chaplins tramp spoke to all walks of lifeand never more eloquently than in such silent films as The Kid and The Gold Rush The Gold Rush is superb It deals with Charlies adventures to win the affection of a local dancehall girl and his hilarious efforts to avoid being eaten by bears and by prospectors who are bigger and hungrier than he The most memorable scene is one in which he dines on an old shoe Chaplins exquisite grace turned the boiled shoe into a gourmet feast he carves it carefully smacks his lips in anticipation and then eats it with gusto and appreciation sucking the nails as if they contained the most juices and twirling the laces around his fork as if they were spaghetti,10
556,tt0015864,In Charles Chaplins  film The Gold Rush a lone prospector travels to California looking for gold and entwines himself in adventures and finds Georgia the woman of his dreams After many hardships including a relocating cabin the lone prospector played by Charles Chaplin finds gold and becomes rich ending in success and unity with Georgia The time period in which this movie was shot compared with the technological innovation and the state of the art filming techniques give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel The use of upclose shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a new feel to the style of silent cinema The scene with the cabin shifting and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin was one of the many stylistic filming techniques that gave The Gold Rush such artistic and ingenious appeal Chaplins ideas and his vision that he brought to life in the movie The Gold Rush make it a great landmark in the beginning of silent films and in film history The intricate but simple story of The Gold Rush brought about many distinct feelings when viewing It gives feelings of happiness during scenes where there is comedic relief and slapstick comedy and also can bring about sadness or pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Years but she never shows up It reveals how silent films can become in touch with a persons feelings making them feel for the protagonist without having to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot These aspects of The Gold Rush make it a milestone in the film industry of the modern world,9
557,tt0015864,One of the best Chaplin movies which means one of the best movies ever made Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as `Eating the shoe and `The Roll Dance Both the original version and the second release have their own charm,10

559,tt0015864,We follow the little fellow Chaplin in his trip to Alaska to find gold  which he ends up succeeding in finding love at the same time The first half of the movie reunites Chaplin another lonesome gold seeker and a moralless scoundrel in a shelter under a particularly horrendous snowstorm There happens one of the most memorable scene of the movie Big Jims delusion that Chaplins is a giant of course bearing Chaplins manners chicken and his desperate attempts to eat him; but Chaplin is saved by a bear showing up which they finally eat Then parting their ways begins the second half of the movie the onesided romance with the beautiful Georgia met in a dance hall How funny was the scene when she invited out of despair our little fellow to dance to avoid dancing with an invading Jake!

561,tt0015864,THE GOLD RUSH United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations So proud of his achievement Chaplin reissued this silent film in  with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself eliminating the use of title cards Then in the summer of  THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting stations week series of The Silent Years as hosted by Orson Welles from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William PerryTHE GOLD RUSH which is set in the turn of the century opens with The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin coming to Alaska A snow storm drives him into the cabin of Black Lawson Tom Murray an outlaw Big Jim McKay Mack Swain another prospector who has found gold on his claim is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin After much struggle Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests Stranded due to the heavy storm Larson finds himself chosen to go out for help While out in the storm he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him He gets away by stealing their dog sled but is later killed in an avalanche Back to the cabin Charlie and Larson almost in near starvation eventually make a meal out of a large bear When the snow storm finally subsides the two men go about their separate ways Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia Georgia Hale a dance hall girl causing jealousy from her suitor Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite As for Jim he has forgotten where his gold claim is and locates Charlie to help him find it separating him from Georgia The results that follow is classic ChaplinAside from a large list of supporting players which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis The Gold Rush contains many now classic comedy supplements including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlies encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement There are tender moments too including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Years Eve dinner with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for themWith THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplins most revived and discussed movie one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed including THE CIRCUS  CITY LIGHTS  MODERN TIMES  and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR  Since the advent of home video in the early s THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores ranging from the use of piano organ or orchestra There are even some editions that have no music track at all along with some copies running different time lengths and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout The  reissue being a shorter print with Chaplins narration not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics but can also be found on Chaplins th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a  comedy short PAY DAY Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection But in spite of numerous editions THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics  and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter  reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector avid lip readers will notice that he is called Charlie by his supporting players especially by Georgia ****,10
562,tt0015864,If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability t you a commend this film as well as City Lights  Modern Times isnt strictly speaking a silent film although Chaplin had no dialogue there  The Gold Rush while not Chaplins best film does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits it must be seen  Excellent film   version redone by Chaplin is a bit better but either will do  Most highly recommended,10
563,tt0015864,To be perfectly honest I wish I could denounce Chaplin more fervently than I find myself able to Right down to my fundamental worldview I am a Buster Keaton person the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness The world as I understand it just doesnt work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay So wishing it did only fosters more painThis is actually worst than The Kid in this respect Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold Oh though filthy rich at that point when in the end he falls practically in the girls arms he is again dressed like a tramp  meaning no doubt he is still the same person  but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul here he gets both There is not even the thought of a compromiseYet I cant help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplins cosmology; the mysterious elusive fates  seemingly random but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose  that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocksNowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside the reality thought to be known understood domesticated into order but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void So every step inside taken casually without much thought is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death Blissful ignorance the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabinIt is a powerful cosmologic symbol what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life With both gold and love impossible love with the dream girl as the chimeras that trick the mindSo Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside but either cannot properly understand – and confuses karma for providential fate  or he does is terrified and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy taleSo however wellmeant its a dishonest patronizing vision of bliss Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging but eventually benevolent whims of providence Its all made right again more than rightNotice how well integrated is this notion inside the film proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the pointofview of the tramp who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger souldefining mechanisms that shape his life that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lessonSo instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill just wait and itll all work out in the end It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the filmSure it is occasionally very funny inventive But were talking here about the more intricate mechanisms that drive a film  and film aspiring to be a truthful reflection of life life itself,0
564,tt0015864,This is the first silent film I have ever seen so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound other than the piano in the background in a  minute movie So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas acrossI felt like they did some of same gags over and over again like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove It just got really old to me quickly I dont know maybe because Im from a different time period and way life but the film just didnt do anything for me I didnt really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only  to  minutes long and nothing would have been lost,3
565,tt0015864,Make them laugh make them laugh The American comic tradition and American movies were made for each other Gold Rush is one example that Charlie Chaplin was the father of American comedy Even though Chaplin loves to press political economical or social messages in his films The Gold Rush remains true to its genre It is a comedy non the less Even at the end of the film when THE TRAMP receives a kiss Chaplin reminds the audience that she has ruined the picture with the kiss This is suppose to be a comedy!,9
566,tt0015864,Spoilers hereinI consider `City Lights to be a masterwork one of the films that every literate person must see This film is often equally celebrated but it seems to be a random collection of integrated ideas to me Some work most dontThe  rescore and voiceover is much tighter visually but sonicly heavy If you have a chance with the DVD see it in the  recut with no sound and subtitlesThe one skit that works the best is the famous dancing rolls bit You really must see three versions of this one after another Look at the original Then see the Robert Downey Jr version done in  almost  years later Notice how much more comic Downeys is because he uses a different timing and is both doing it and referencing the Chaplin dance Then see the Johnny Depp version of the year later which pokes fun at the Downey version and reannotates the original A work of genius overlain on a masterpieceOtherwise there are better silent comedies to see And better ChaplinTeds Evaluation   of  Has some interesting elements,0
567,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is a showcase of sorts for Chaplin In it he provides audiences with a wide range of cinematic elements from his signature slapstick routines to dramatic relationships The rags to riches plot was interesting and witty but felt dragged out While Chaplin is good at emotionally engaging the audience with relateable situations like getting stood up or competing for a woman the lack of serious conflict makes the film seem simple The special effects were handled nicely even by todays standards but the true enjoyment in the film comes from watching the tramp endure hardship as he accidentally progresses into wealthiness and sees his life fall together by favorable coincidence,6
568,tt0015864,Spoiler AlertThe Gold Rush is perhaps one of the best silent movies I have ever seenAlthough it takes a bit to get used to silent movie language youll be rewarded with a marvelousfunny and poignant movieSome of the scenes are hilarious and some really touches your heartstrings Chaplin as performer gives one of his best performances in this movie There are plenty of great scenesChaplin and Mack Swain in the cabincrazy with hunger and cabin feverthe touching New Years Eve party and finally the hilarious finale with the cabin out on the edge of a cliffThe later version which was released with added narration and music wasnt as good as the originalbut easier for modern audiences to watch,8
569,tt0015864,What a delightful film I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them like the eating shoe scene fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Years Eve knowing that he was stoodup I genuinely felt for him Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time Brilliant,10
570,tt0015864,The primitive production values the decrepitlooking camera work and the silent soundtrack with only musical scores to suffice for the lack of the talkie in that era does little to ruin the viewers chance of being entertained by this highly enjoyable classic masterpiece by Charlie Chaplin The Little Tramp finds himself in the Yukon braving the wintery elements bears and a psychopath all for the sake of claiming his own fortune of gold Under his expert direction Chaplin guides THE GOLD RUSH with painstaking detail of what life would be like to live in the freezing extremes having to shack up in a  cabin in danger of toppling over a snowcapped cliff and feasting on shoes for protein Amidst all the atrocities Chaplin being that likeable underdog that everybody roots for and loves overcomes the odds managing to make the best out of a bad read terrible situation He even takes the time to humor himself and a few ladies with a songanddance number involving two forks and a pair of potatoes,0
571,tt0015864,The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights?  There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator  There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramps world City Lights falls short  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what Charlot has been all about all along It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplins works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime  out of ,10
572,tt0017136,Technically speaking I have seen this Fritz Lang silent scifi before but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the s The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable apocalyptic fantasy and religious allegory It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers who toil in the depths tending the machines and the upper classes who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers The hero the idle pampered son of the citys supervisor Joh Fredersen changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria the Madonna of the workers His father meanwhile is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didnt see In addition to restoring scenes to the film the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version With these changes the story becomes much clearer particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis Perhaps most importantly a whole new subplot is added involving the heros dead mother Hel who was loved by both his father and Rotwang With this clarification of the backstory the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer In some ways it recalls the family backstory of the Star Wars movies Of course the real strength of Metropolis isnt the story which is pretty silly and probably wouldnt have worked in anything but a silent film but its amazing visuals which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to  and Blade Runner Actually though in most respects silent films now look primitive one area in which they have the edge over modern filmmaking is in their frequently grandiose production design Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world The models of the citys towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a s film Even beyond the expansive production design and for the time special effects Langs visuals are all consistently inventive The robot Maria provides some of the movies most iconic images including her transformation into a human being In a later scene she performs for upperclass men in a nightclub and as she performs a striptease that in s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs A sign of Langs visual lavishness and the studios that he doesnt hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a characters state of mind For instance when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idols head into which the workers are being sacrificed At another point while hes sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs labor parable and Lang gives us spectacular images of the towers construction and fall In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and overliteral but theyre what silent cinema does best tell a story without the advantage or obstacle of dialogue The story is a little slow to start but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that Ive seen In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films as the workers riot and sabotage the machines endangering the entire city Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than  years,9
573,tt0017136,Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the s? Sure some science fiction movies are huge today such as George Lucas latest goofy Star Wars movie but in  Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then And sure enough we went right ahead living the way we were living the population got bigger and more crowded and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society Metropolis was run by his father John Frederson the master of Metropolis He lives in a Pleasure Garden high above the level of the workers and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father given the terrible conditions under which they live and work Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic sinister looking machine The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devillooking monster  After countless workers are consumed by it no wonder this was Hitlers favorite film they are immediately replaced by other workers who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements If some of these scenes men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured and the rest of the workers keep right on working hardly even noticingThe way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated `Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups is a saying that doesnt necessarily only apply to stupid people as Metropolis suggests Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue and the result is still compelling today The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways except that the two films can hardly be compared  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least An excellent film Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten,10
574,tt0017136,I doubt that Id ever seen anything resembling a complete version of METROPOLIS before though certain of its scenes were familiar to me if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keatons HEAVEN   In any case whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration  I expected to be distracted by the restorations technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it  As exaggerated as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards some performances such as the Master of the city are amazingly nuanced and layered and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone The meticulous design of the film the unerring camera placement and Langs muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking Id thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity important = dull but now Ive come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been,10
575,tt0017136,Fritz Langs Metropolis is the first true masterpiece of science fiction in film You can see its influence in films such as Star Wars The Matrix Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Blade Runner and countless others Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were in some cases phenomenal I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is  years old because a lot has happened in film since then Yet if you look at the basic elements of this movie  its story characters artwork cinematography etc I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late s Also take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this The performances and set designs are going to be over the top That was part of the style Metropolis may not be for everyone but for those willing to read between the lines this film still has a lot to offer!,8
576,tt0017136,In the future the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes the workers who live in the underground below the machines level and the dominant classes that lives on the surface The workers are controlled by their leader Maria Brigitte Helm who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles Maria meets Freder Fredersen Gustav Fröhlich the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen Alfred Abel in a meeting of the workers and they fall in love for each other Meanwhile Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate themMetropolis is a fantastic futuristic view of the fight of classes When Metropolis was shot it was a romantic revolutionary period of mankind history with socialist movements around the world Fritz Lang directed and wrote the screenplay of this masterpiece certainly inspired in this historical moment and defending a position of agreement and understanding between both sides showing that they need each other I wonder how this great director was able to produce such special effects in  with very primitive cameras and equipment The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art My vote is tenTitle Brazil MetropolisNote On  March  I saw this film again on BluRay,10
577,tt0017136,Metropolis is surely one of the greatest films ever made  Its scope its reach its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by todays standards of filmmaking  Seen in context of its premier in  Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history  Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great and in particular Metropolis  A great film is one that stirs the imagination leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life and achieves a kind of immortality  Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria  Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings halluciatory scenes and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions  There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria  Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups  Lastly Metropolis has stood the test of time  It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre  The story itself is simplea Biblical allegory about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen  The film is anything but simple  It is immense and a rich legacy that director Fritz Lang has left us,0
578,tt0017136,I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie This is without a doubt the best scifi movie Ive ever seen! Let me explain my position We have all seen modern scifi movies and argued over which is the best ever made but those film makers have high speed film and computers Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in  and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must see for all persons interested in the history of film as well as just good fun for everyone The social metaphores as well as the religious and philosophical double meanings are a sight to behold,10
579,tt0017136,This must be one of the greatest movies of all time I found myself almost in a state of shock during the whole movie Everything was perfect The story was great the filming was pure genius and the effects directly from another dimensionI dont think any movie after this one have gotten so much out of the available effects of the time as this one Nowadays they have super computers generating special effects Sure they look good but its no big deal making them Back in  computers werent even invented yet all effects had to be done by hand or in simple editing And when you take a look at all the thins that have been done in this movie its impossible not to get impressed Huge buildings explosions flooding picture phones however did he come up with the very idea? transformation sequences robots and so on No movie has ever pulled the limits of special effects as much as this one Star Wars and Jurassic Park are also known as limit pullers in special effects but they dont even come closeThen you have the filming Everything is perfect The use of body language is tremendous the light setting perfect everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera Ive never been witness to such a treat in filming other placesAnd the story!!! Perfect in every detail Intriguing exciting and thrilling with lots of religious undertones and tyranic leaders No wonder Hitler liked this movieI dont know how the original music of the film was but the new music for the restored  minute version I saw was really good and moodsetingAll in all This is one of the most perfect movies of all time and it deserves anything it can get Never has a / been as secure as for this movie,10
580,tt0017136,Silent movies are not for everyone Neither are subtitles Those brave enough to view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between should definitely enjoy this silent masterpiece One of the biggest productions of its time Metropolis still holds its own when set design and special effects are compared But what Metropolis really has is orginality This GermanExpressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future modern city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern scifi Star Warss CPO was based on Bridgette Helms robot Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis lookalike cities This is a very good movie Its too bad most movies dont have its originality,9
581,tt0017136,Fritz Langs groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema How can a movie thatll soon turn  years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages The world has been divided into two main categories thinkers &amp; workers! If you belong to the first category you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if youre a worker your life isnt worth a penny and youre doomed to perilous labor underground The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself Its essential viewing anyway! Metropolis is a very demanding filmexperience and definitely not always entertaining But as it is often the case with silentcinema classics the respect and admiration youll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoymentaspect Fritz brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to recreate a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines Many supposedly restored versions have been released over the years in  and  for example but the version is still the finest in my opinion even though that one already isnt as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it Metropolis perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made  A Space Odyssey Star Wars and Blade Runner owe their existence or at least their power to it,8
582,tt0017136,Metropolis is my alltime favourite movie so Ive saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb Ive enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies Ive seen but now Im moving on to other passionsAlthough written by Fritz Langs wife Thea von Harbou Metropolis was originally Langs idea he was inspired by the sight of New Yorks skyscrapers when he sailed to America in  During his American trip he visited the set of The Phantom of the Opera and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasnt filmedDespite its epic power Metropolis makes very little sense The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen so why is the one named Freder*sen* the father not son of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwangs crude little cottage the only preFredersen building that wasnt demolished during the construction of this city? Von Harbous very long and unwieldy novelisation of her script establishes this fact but never explains it How and why did Rotwangs hightech laboratory manage to get constructed BENEATH that cottage without disturbing it?For modern viewers some of the plots incoherence can be blamed on missing footage particularly in American prints The distributors for this films original Stateside release commissioned playwright Channing Pollock to translate the German titles A major subplot of the backstory features a deceased woman named Hel who was married to Rotwang but left him to marry Fredersen and give birth to Freder This unseen womans name could not easily be changed for the American version due to a couple of shots of her memorial engraved with the Teutonic name HEL Apparently Pollock feared that American viewers would be offended by this words similarity to Hell so he simply excised the entire subplot from this long movieThe reallife drama on the set of Metropolis mustve been quite interesting in itself Mad scientist Rotwang alias Doctor Strangeglove is played by actor Rudolf KleinRogge who had been married to scenarist von Harbou before she left him to marry Fritz Lang the mastermind of this film In Metropolis Rotwangs wife left him to marry the master of Metropolis Id love to know how KleinRogge felt about the fact that his reallife marital and sexual situation was the inspiration for key plot elements of this movie  and I wonder how KleinRogge felt about knowing that the entire cast and crew knew this as wellMost astonishing about this gargantuan production is the fact that nearly all of Metropolis was actually built to scale with just a couple of miniaturesTrivia tidbit actress Brigitte Helm was cast in the dual female role largely because she was flatchested and therefore she could easily fit inside the mechanical suit for the Robotrix A more busty actress would have suffered constant discomfort inside those galvanised bosoms of the metal costume I learnt this more than  years ago from an eldery Austrian stagehand who worked on the filmFor all its flaws Metropolis will always be my favourite movie Ive enjoyed writing all these reviews for IMDb The joy of posting my reviews on this site has brought me many friendships and a few enemies Well you cant win em allNitrate film stock doesnt last forever and all good things come to a happy ending This is my last review here Ill keep watching movies but other passions are important to me as well Thank you IMDb and thank you to everyone who has read my reviews I will happily rate Metropolis a full  out of ,10
583,tt0017136,One definitely cant fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Langs vision even if as always with depictions of the future there are a few forgivable blind spots The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the s as are the flyingmachines that buzz about them; while the business dress of tomorrows rulers unlike their exotic leisure wear doesnt appear to have advanced one iota!HGWells criticised the film for its adherence to arty image over scientific rigour and as a piece of coherent science fiction its certainly as lacking as he claimed The machines exist to appear awesome and to torment their workers rather than to perform any apparent task and there is no explanation of how this society functions how it evolved or how it is sustained let alone of the incongruities that must surely lie behind such anomalous locations as the catacombs and the cathedral But Wells own futuristic film Things to Come conceived in direct riposte to Langs unscientific approach is tedious and talky as a result didactic in its heavyfooted philosophy and explanations and lacking in artistic vision Metropolis may be soft SF but its approach undoubtedly makes for better cinemaI am not however impressed by it as a film Masterpiece of Modernism it may be  but great design and special effects cant save todays bigbudget clunkers from deficiencies of character and plot and they dont save this one Ironically I suspect that its reputation has benefited greatly from its being the only silent film many of its viewers have ever encountered reading through the IMDb pages I see wellmeaning comments like Great  when you consider how primitive cinema was in  and once you get used to the fact that it takes about ten gestures to convey one sentence It wasnt  and it doesnt!As silent films go this is in many places agonizingly slow and repetitious marred by clumsy acting tendentious titles and overwrought gestures By the late s cinema had progressed far beyond this laboured pantomime in Langs case the heavy stylisation may have been a deliberate choice but compared to the fluidity of contemporaries such as Sjostroms The Wind or The Scarlet Letter Asquiths Underground or Shooting Stars and Murnaus Sunrise the film comes across as ten years behind the times The problem is not necessarily with the actors  Brigitte Helm as has been observed does an excellent job in differentiating her two characters  but with the direction and pacingWe saw the restored version with the original Gottfried Huppertz score; the latter didnt always seem to fit too well with pops jumps and awkward silences but this was I assume due either to the difficulty of fitting it to allow for the missing material or to problems in the projection booth when running a newlyarrived print for the first time However the painstaking summary of the various missing scenes only ended up increasing my appreciation of what a good job had been done in the editingdown in the first place! To take a single example where the edited version conveys Freders sudden recollection that he is supposed to be the workers longawaited mediator via the simple juxtaposition of three shots  the shiftchange whistle announcing the meeting the catacombs and Freder suddenly struck by an idea and rushing off  the restoration betrays the fact that a couple of scenes of mimed dialogue were originally provided to spell out the message at painstaking lengthIt is interesting to see how it was done but most of the cuts are either an improvement or a very clever abridgement and by and large I didnt feel that what was omitted had been any great loss In fact frankly I felt that the film was in need of further editing at certain points such as Rotwangs pursuit of Maria through the catacombs She screams and runs and screams and runs and is pursued by a searchlight effect; its clever selfconsciously clever the first couple of times but the repetition becomes tedious to the point of caricature Plot infelicities abound in increasing numbers culminating in the infamous Hunchback of Notre Damestyle ending where the mad scientist carries off the girl across the roof of the cathedral hotly pursued by Our Hero which raised giggles in a hitherto serious and respectful audience with which I couldnt help but sympathiseThis is a film to see once in a lifetime so that you can say that you have seen it  not least because most of the impact lies in the visuals But its all surface and no substance the characters act arbitrarily the plot is subservient to the Message the pacing is like treacle the storytelling technique is primitive and really all it has going for it is the visual flair and the special effects I quite honestly believe that this work would be better appreciated as a set of stills in a glossy brochure; an exhibit in a design exhibition This is not cinema as I love it  its innovative it may be Art but as an actual film its only a poor shadow,6
584,tt0017136,There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator This is the predominant theme of Metropolis and director Fritz Lang finds numerous ways to say and visualize his message during the course of the film The movie relies on repeated visual imagery to make its point and does so effectively even if tedious at times Particularly effective is the representation of the worker society as an almost single living unit moving trance like to their appointed time and task The use of a ten hour clock in the workers chamber constantly draws our attention as does the hangdog posture of the individual slaves who grind out their workday as if in a dazeAmid this rabble worker Maria Brigitte Helm is the inspirational voice of the workers offering hope for a brighter future by a mediator yet to appear However the Master of Metropolis John Frederson Alfred Abel sees in her a way to quell the underlying frustration of the workers commissioning his scientist Rotwang to create a robot Maria to plant discord among the workers Rotwangs laboratory would have done Frankenstein proud and the creation of the robot is a marvel of cinematic imagery The robot Marias belly dance transforms into a scene of such raw energy and sexual awareness that it awakens the statues of the Seven Deadly Sins one of the master strokes of this expressionist filmSo much imagery in fact is layered into Metropolis that its safe to say that repeat viewings will lead to even more interpretations of its vision and not simply for its denunciation of a class society Both timely and timeless the film captures a dynamism that inspires passion even after nearly eighty years following its original release,8
585,tt0017136,I really hate it when I dont enjoy a classic film I really want to enjoy it but I just cant I want to understand some peoples love for it but I just cant Metropolis falls under this category An unbearably slow film I watched the restoration which is over  hours longthat may have been a bad idea that starts off with interesting ideas but then seems to not really do much with them It is the year  the wealthy rule the city of Metropolis while the lowerclass work for hours on end underground in awful conditions The Master of Metropolis is Joh Fredersen Alfred Abel and his son is Freder Gustav Frohlich who spends his days with other rich people in a place called the pleasure garden where he truly does nothing at all A woman named Maria Brigitte Helm brings a group of working children up for a visit in pleasure garden and Freder is quickly enamored by Maria Freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shocked as an explosion goes off and kills multiple workers He reports this to his father who is disappointed his son was the first to report it over his assistant Josepha Theodor Loos and his assistant is quickly fired This does an immediate job of showing the coldness of Joh but they never do much else with his character In fact very little of the characters are developed in anyway Most of them are completely uninteresting and the setting itself is compelling at first but quickly loses anything interesting halfway through the film as the film moves at a snail pace Anyways the main aspect of the plot here is that the workers are led by Maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of a mediator to make it happen My real issue is that the film starts with such a great idea and had potential to become something like  Im aware it came out afterwords and that its a novel but still just an example but it instead becomes filled with strange religious allusions and becomes a witch hunt essentially by the end They never really do any decent social commentary at all If any at all This wouldnt matter if the film was actually entertaining but it only is in spurts and then quickly becomes a repetitive bore I do think the special effects were impressive and this film is obviously important for being the first full length science fiction filmwell ever That doesnt mean it holds up because it doesnt In fact itd be hard for me to believe the film was entertaining in  I still wonder if I had watched the shorter version of the film how much more I wouldve enjoyed the film It certainly wouldve have been paced better considering so much of this film is unbelievably uninteresting But I dont think that changes the fact that this movie doesnt really do anything It isnt entertaining It doesnt really have a message What is this movie? I guess good special effects for ? Whatever Im glad I gave this classic a chance but I highly doubt Ill revisit it anytime soon,4
586,tt0017136,This review contains Spoilers But since the story is by far the least reason to watch Metropolis feel free to still read it even if you havent watched it yetMetropolis is a film that was far ahead of its time It influenced a great lot of sciencefiction films and how The Blade Runner Batman or Dark City would look like if there wasnt Metropolis  who knows Even The Matrix Reloaded is heavily inspired by this classic that is as old as my grandmother Now what is it all about? About Freder the son of the head of the city of Metropolis a Christlike figure who falls in love with the preacher of the working class a saintlike woman who happens to be named Maria When a robot who is modeled to look like Maria makes the workers almost extinguish their city and their children Maria and Freder save the children and in the end Freder makes his father and the workers cooperate for a brighter futureSounds silly to you? Yes and thats exactly what the story is silly Thats also the reason why still today Metropolis isnt accepted as the masterpiece it is by a few film buffs But these people dont understand one thing A good film does more than only tell a story A film can be great even without a story at all and a silly story combined with amazing visuals can make you forget all the other weaknesses a film has And wow what amazing images Metropolis offers What an art direction! What wonderful special effects! And remember as I already said this film is as old as my grandmother! Just have a look at the workers They hardly ever seem to be individuals In the mass scenes they look like one big creature moving forward or backwards When they are working they look more like machines than like human beings whereas the machines resemble monsters more than they do technical devices best seen in the moments when Freder hallucinates and sees the big machine as a workereating Moloch We also see a worker and later Freder work on a machine that looks like a clock with  blinking light bulbs doing some that looks as exhausting as it looks senseless Or think of Rotwang the mad inventor who lives in a little hut that looks in this film like it was from another world He has a black prosthesis for his right hand its not a coincidence that Stanley Kubrick gave his mad scientist/inventor Dr Strangelove a prosthesis for his right hand too He builds the robot that he makes to look like Maria and that transformation scene is one of the most magnificent scenes ever and looks more convincing than some scenes of modern scifi flicks I also have to mention Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and the robot  and the look in her eyes would already be enough to tell which of her characters is on screen at the moment If something like awards already would have been given in the s she sure would have walked home with quite a bunch of them And just look at her sexy dance! It is just as memorable as the shot of the many eyes watching her dance  or the many faces watching her preach just a few minutes later Metropolis is a film no scififan should miss I had the good luck that my first viewing of Metropolis one year ago was in a cinema when it was a rereleased after its restoration I can only recommend you to watch it in a cinema if you have the possibility to as Metropolis is just as   A Space Odyssey one of those rare films that are masterpieces on your TV set but a revelation on the big screen,10
587,tt0017136,I was very anxious to see Metropolis for the first time I had been into silent movies for a couple of years but hadnt had the opportunity to see Fritz Langs classic I finally saw it at a silent movie theater in Hollywood and my feelings were to say the least mixedThe film is visually stunning Monumental sets brilliantly directed scenes amazing special effects by the standards of the time In fact I might say that I was more enthralled by the visual effects of this movie than I was by say Lord of the Rings or Avatar Whereas Cameron and Jackson used CGI to make their visions come true; Lang had to use camera trickery paint and woodThis movie no doubt set the lexicon for the SciFi and blockbuster genre in stone The images of Metropolis have been repeated in innumerable movies The scene of the underground city being flooded has curious similarities to James Camerons Titanic Even the villainous Rotwang can be seen in the characters Dr Strangelove and Doc Brown from Back to the FutureBut then theres the story And the dialogue And the acting which is overwrought even by the standards of the time But I dont have enough room to go into thatStarting with the opening line LookThese are your brothers a violent cringe would run through my body every time the intertitles would appearThe later line about the head and hands needing the heart as mediator caused a huge outburst of laughter in the theater This serves as the basis for the moral of the story which was eerily similar to How the Grinch Stole Christmas Essentially it can boiled down to this Somebody according to writer Thea von Harbous later beliefs this turned out to be Adolf Hitler needs to appeal to the hearts of capitalist managers and tell them to be nice to their workers The outcome is a grudging handshake between the head manager Joh Frederson and the leader of the workers Grot; and thus begins a shining new day!Metropolis also incorporates religious symbolism which is to say the very least heavyhanded Scenes of the Seven Deadly Sins The Tower of Babel an altar to Moloch and the Flood all warn of doom to decadent societies that exploit the weak and kill the righteousIn the end this muddled mixture of Socialist calls for justice and Christian Apocalypticism creates a political message that Lang himself described as sillyI recommend this film for its artistic brilliance and groundbreaking techniques But dont go into this expecting an award quality filmIf you want to get into silent film this is a relatively easy one to get start with However I dont know if thats a good or a bad thing Ive met too many people whove said that Metropolis was the best silent movie theyve ever seen; which probably means that it was the only one that they ever bothered to watch I would recommend Sunrise or City Lights as a first over this,5
588,tt0017136,Francis Ford Coppola once said that Apocalypse Now wasnt just about Vietnam is was Vietnam In a similar way Metropolis isnt just about the Twentieth Century it is the Twentieth Century Almost every image in it reflects or more often predicts the realities of life in the West over the past hundred years in a way that is truly uncannyFrom small details  the traffic jams and blackouts that plague city dwellers  to major historical events  the climactic flood predicts every industrial disaster that has destroyed the lives of thousands of workers from Chernobyl to the Bhopal disaster whilst Fredersens vision of workers being fed to Moloch cant help but bring to mind the holocaust  Metropolis feels prescient in any number of ways In the image of the Manhattan skyline Lang really did find the perfect symbol of the coming century  progressive new faceless oppressiveThis is far from the simple Marxist fable it is often taken for  although the Socialist message can hardly be ignored Its also a Christian parable Maria flanked by crosses is counterbalanced by the Machine brought to life under a pentagram informed by the book of Revelation; a retelling of the Orpheus myth with Freder as Orpheus and Maria as Eurydice lost in the underworld; and a Kafkaesque nightmare of depersonalisation although the Gothic expressionistic production design is a long way from Kafkas more sterile styleIts also lest we forget a silly adventuremelodrama with a mad scientist an evil twin a bad father with a noble son and an impossibly virtuous idealised heroine In many ways it anticipates Star Wars in dressing up mythic standards with Science Fiction tropes  with Fredersen as the misguided King Freder as the handsome Prince Maria the goodhearted peasants daughter Rotwang as a scheming sorcerer and the Machine as the wicked witch appropriately burnt at the stake by the villagersThe MachineMan a confusing name for a construction so obviously feminine is the single most indelible image of the film; the scene in which Rotwang brings her to life for the first time is a real moment of magic and awe untarnished by eighty subsequent years of cinematic showmanship Even better is the scene in which she becomes a duplicate of Maria  such an obvious influence on James Whales Frankenstein that its hard not to shout out Its alive! The optical effects are years ahead of their time certainly the best of their kind until the sixties at least It also marks the beginning of Brigitte Helms truly extraordinary turn as the false MariaThis is only the third silent film Ive seen after Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and its taken me a while to acclimatise to the acting style which can seem close to parody What it really reminds me of however is modern dance which similarly seeks to communicate with the audience visually rather than verbally Metropolis encourages this comparison with the highly choreographed movements of the workers operating the machinery Bearing this in mind Helm is hugely impressive in multiple roles Maria could be a rather dull and virtuous heroine she enters the film surrounded by poor children in rags but Helm invests her with enormous energy and expressiveness It helps that the script allows her to take an unusually proactive role for a female character organising workers meetings and racing to the rescue of the endangered children However it is her performance as bad Maria vamping up a storm that lingers in the memory  the twitching jerking movements of her head and body the Anne Robinson style halfwink that changes the shape of her face that malicious little grin that makes it hard not to root for her mischief The entirely weird erotic dance that she performs isnt technically very good or erotic but it is utterly unforgettable Subtextually shes the Whore of BabylonThe other performances are mainly very good particularly Alfred Abel as Fredersen proving that it is possible to underplay in a silent film Only Rudolf KleinRogge hits any wrong notes  difficult as it undoubtedly must be to play a mad scientist in a silent film with subtlety some of his more unrestrained gesticulations leave you worried about the safety of the other actorsUltimately though it all inevitably comes back to the imagery Langs film remains unmatched even today Pick a scene any scene  the synchronised shuffling crowds at the shift change; our first sighting of the Metropolis all biplanes skyscrapers and suspended motorways; the vision of Moloch; the MachineMan awakening; Maria pursued along a pitchblack tunnel by a beam of light; the statue of Death coming to life in the Cathedral; disembodied eyes entranced by the twitching false Maria; the crowds swarming up the steps in the Tower of Babel section; the lifts crashing down one by one; desperate children crowding around Maria as the floodwaters close in; and most of all false Maria laughing as she burns on her pyre then transforming back to her metal visage No film before or since matches this for spectacle And if in order to appreciate it you have to swallow a little treacle about the heart being the mediator between head and hands well trust me its worth it,9
589,tt0017136,We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Langs Metropolis are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upperclass and operated by slavelike poor The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan These elements can be found in this films ancestors Frankenstein Batman Gattaca and the cities of Blade Runner Star Wars and The Fifth Element All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Langs workMetropolis has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes After its success in  the film has had an uneasy time Its pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in  Unless a lost version surfaces as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentinos  film Beyond the Rocks the complete work my never be seen again The restored version released on DVD in  was based on a digital restoration at K resolution from all available sources Its the best version that Ive seen and I would highly recommend that one if you havent seen the film The worst is a  print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration the film in grainy and difficult to see it doesnt even have a soundtrack I call that one the worst because Im still a little ambivalent about the  restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting good sound effects not so good and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy Freddy Mercury Bonnie Tyler Adam Ant and Pat Benatar yuck!Those who study the film myself included find the story impenetrable Some films you can easily decipher but Metropolis has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that its hard to pin it down as a whole Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the films chaotic nature It takes place in the future restored versions offer title cards that suggest that its the year  but I dont go by that in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers the Gothic sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives dancing in their penthouses and spending their money The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step They dont so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses slaves building his pyramids The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another One person that isnt ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his officeHis son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the workers children Curious he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there The woman is Maria a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be foundFreder uncovers a plot by Rotwang the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms This leads to the films most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzyThen all Hell breaks loose but the rest I must leave to you to discoverLang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film and therefore less successful the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers At one point Freder disguised as a worker witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen Another suggests an odd device a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around its edge The machine doesnt seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless dayThe film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism astonishing in its use of light and shadow One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in Another brilliant moment comes with Marias erotic dance as the men gawk the camera filled with their moist eyes This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home videoOther moments have deeper resonance There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves Walking to work they march with their heads down dressed in uniforms and caps It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler More obvious are Langs biblical references The rise of the city parallels Marias retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel The giant pentagram in Rotwangs lab as he plays God The breathtaking image of the plaguebringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself There is even a Christlike quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakersThese elements and images are brought to the film because of Langs insistence on no less then absolute perfection He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster working his cast and crew like a dictator He cast some  extras  of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone and worked them from morning till night The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with himI could go on and on this film all great films invite lengthy discussions It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over But when you get down to it the best way to view Metropolis is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of its time Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad,0
590,tt0017136,This truly is a classic masterpiece and honestly one of the best movies ever made The story is brilliant and the visuals amazingI have seen the German  minutes version of the movie without subtitles Yes its a long watch but its worth every second of it Basically only reason why the movie is so long is because they need about ten hand gestures to speak one sentence Its kind of dreadful to look at first but once youre used to it it shouldnt trouble you anymoreIn many ways this movie can be regarded as the Blade Runner of the s Metropolis is set in a futuristic world that has a same kind of atmosphere as in Blade Runner The mix of s cars and propellerplanes with futuristic machines highways buildings and androids is very unusual but an absolutely awesome thing to look at The movie was ahead of its time and in some ways also propheticThe story is absolutely the best thing of the movie Also the way the story is told and directed by Fritz Lang deserves credit The story is tense and has quite some symbolism layers and storylines but remains always easy to follow The ending is truly spectacular and tense The way how spectacular and tense the ending and the entire movie in general was really surprised me in a positive wayThe sets are obviously fake and miniatures at times but they still manage to convince and impress Further more the movie is filled with some fantastic and very convincing early special effectsMan who also deserves credit is Alfred Abel Wow what a great actor he was in this movieAn absolute must see and one of the best movies of all time/http//bobafettblogspotcom/,10
591,tt0017136,MetropolisMetropolis is one of the most exciting and exceptional works of art that humankind has produced This epic science fiction film is one of Germanys famous silent movies created by Fritz Lang and liberated in  the period between the two World WarsThis movie represents the expressionist cinema and shows us the repression of human needs by the machine age Langs creation of a selfdestructive society is a protest against the machine age Metropolis is one of the most magnificent cities of  is kept alive by the unceasing work of the underground people who live in slavery and is enjoyed by wealthy and educated people The Austrian director of the movie Fritz Lang presents the story of a master John Federsen who sees people as machines working constantly to maintain the luxury and technology of his metropolis On the other side his son Freder falls in love with one of the underground workers who is a spiritual leader for the slaves The son recognizes the unsentimental heart of his father and starts a revolution The city gets flooded and Maria Freders love regains the workers trust after a robot had stolen her identity she finds her loved one after saving the citys children and the workers shake hands with the masterExpressionism tries to simplify the world and to understand it emotionally in a subjective way It is very important to understand this definition of this dynamic violent and distorted movement in order to understand that Lang tried to externalize his own internal vision of the world through simple expressions The name metropolis comes from the Greeks and means mothercity It has this significance because a metropolis is the biggest form of a technologically and economically developed city Nevertheless referring to the movie name this film can be considered as the mother city of all cinematic clichés In this story there are two main characters Maria and Freder These two characters are also the heroes of the story because they are the ones who rescue the population from being drowned in the flood John Federson is a person full of empowering feelings who only thinks of himself and of his city forgetting about the ones who work for him All the fantasies that he has come true through the power of his workers but he never thinks about the danger they are in while working for him This man wants so much power that he is almost hypnotized by it; he is obsessed and possessed by the power of inventions and creationsOn the other hand Maria is just a symbol of munificence her soul is pure and she is seen like an angel who brings peace to the world Maria convoys the people in a church settling area She is shown as sanctity a holy person that is surrounded by the light of the candles She is positioned higher than the workers who carefully listen to her as she speaks about peace unity and their salvation by a mediator that will soon come Her eyes inspire confidence and kindness as she kisses Freder in the church scene In general all she does is for the good of humanity One thing that she repeats in the movie is Between the head and hands there must be a heart  This means that she realizes the bad things that the head John Frederson does and the good things that the hands workers do But she knows that these workers should not be treated poorly or like robots and that she can be the heart which can persuade the head and the hands to cooperate to come to common interests Maria as her name suggests is also a biblical motif She explains to the workers the story of the Tower of Babel The workers in the story destroy this tower which parallels how the movie will end with the destruction of the machines by the workforce Maria is still the representation of Jesus mother because she is trying to save the lives of the underground children She would sacrifice herself and alike Mother Mary she has a strong faith in the creator of the world All the scenes of this film are perfectly created at the eye level so that anyone is able to view the action However there is also a birds eye view at the beginning of the movie as the panorama of the city is shown from high above the ground This view was created to give us an impression of how widely extended and huge Metropolis is In addition the focus of the dramatic camera angles with bold shadows is on the disproportioned landscape as well as on the rightangled buildings There are moments in which the camera focuses on fast movement scenes like the dancing of the robot in the nightclub and scenes where it focuses on slow movement like in the beginning of the film where the slaves are shown going into the working area at a certain pace and aligned as robots When more people are involved in a scene like the one in which all the children are surrounding Maria as she rings the danger bell the angles are vertical triangular but when only one person is focused there is a closeup to allow us to read that characters expressions and feelings A good example would be the closeups on the master Fredersons eyes as he asks his secretary why his son was allowed to go underground and as well after that scene when he is thinking in order to suggest this dictators meditation and frustration Another important aspect of the camera and of Expressionism that I have remarked was the scene in which the mad scientist tries to run away from Freder and kidnaps Maria He is walking up on the roof of a sharpangled building holding Maria under his arm as if nothing would happen The same scene was notable in Robert Wienes film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari as Cesare walks up on the roof with the kidnapped fiancé and the city crowd follows himTime also is significant in the film because the clock keeps showing up in the most important scenes Time is evident in Fredersons office as his son challenges him to have mercy for the people as well as he is talking to his secretary Still only a small portion of the clock is shown in these shots and it means the time in which the master can think what decisions to take On the other hand a gigantic clock is shown as Freder finds an exhausted worker trying to turn a wallclock Freder understands the struggle of this man and replaces him There is where he finds out that at  pm Maria will have a meetingBut all that we have seen in this movie is not only made to show us the great importance of this silent SF film that can keep the watcher alive by its impressive music and can inspire contemporary movies like Matrix  but for its great historical importance Fritz Lang expressed a social life in this movie as well as a political one After WWI when Germany had lost a war peoples lives were a disaster Everyone was disoriented and could not keep up with the tragedy that was going on and maybe there were some influences of the great antiSemitism that was supposed to follow But Germany was a great disaster as well and there was nothing it could have done to prevent it because many troubles kept adding up over the years and this country had to be defeated morally and politically as well as economically Even if Germanys wish of reconstruction was as utopic as Fredersens wish of a technological city the postwar inflation had a big contribution on cinemas development,0
592,tt0017136,I typically dont like silent films but I decided to watch this one for two reasons  First I usually like scifi movies and second Metropolis had received so many glowing reviews that I couldnt pass it up  However my opinion of this film is below what most reviewers have been sayingKinos digitally remastered version on DVD is very impressive  The sound and picture quality are both excellent  However I have to conclude that favorable reviews of this film are likely based on nostalgia on the films influence on future films and on the incredible visual effects given its year of release  Film history buffs and silent film fans should see this movie  I thought this was a good film but not a great one  A rating of  is much too high and at # there are plenty of better films ranked below itFirst the good parts of the film  The special effects are excellent for a pres film  The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work the decisions they make and in how easily they are led/misled  The main character is well developed throughout the film and the audience can relate to him well  The film is visually stunning and impressive  The story of the working class vision of the future machinemen etc have had a very strong influence on many films which came later,4
593,tt0017136,For its time this movie has stunning visuals kind of Kubrickesqe in appearance especially the opening scenes of workers going and coming from work Its very strange with the group leaving walking with their heads down like zombiesThe set designs in here are also something that might draw your attention This really has a futuristic look I thought the visuals were fascinating This was German expressionist filmwork at its height I would think Director Fritz Lang went on to become a very famous man in his profession This wasnt his first effort but I think this might have been the film that put him on the map so to speak Several years later he gained a lot more fame with M At any rate with the photography sets and overall Flash Gordontype scifi look this must have been a real eyeopener to movies viewers  years ago I still think they look very cool today The music was also very dramatic at least in this restored  surround sound restoration DVD put out by KlinoObviously the eye makeup on men and the exaggerated motions by actors in silent films look a little hokey but I was mesmerized by Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and her evil clone She is something else! I also appreciated Klinos explanation of lost footage and how they did the best they could do to still make the story flow together They did an outstanding job I wouldnt attempt to watch this on anything less than this DVD which looks pretty darn goodThis is a worker story about a man wanting to trade his comfortable life to join the oppressed workers who do their thing beneath the earth in Metropolis Workers are seen as nothing but replaceable robots If someone gets hurt they get carted away and replaced immediately but some other zombielike human Of course people being mistreated can only take it for so long before rebellion Thats history from the days of the Jewish slaves in Egypt to today so thats part of this story too I wont say more to ruin itI dont want to mislead people on one major point todays audiences watching this Few people in  watch silent movies To ask them to sit through two hours of a silent film is obviously asking a lot I had to break this up into several viewings myself but thats okay I still enjoyed itbut it a silent movie this long is not easy to sit through You have to be a student of film or a big film buff to watch thisbut those people will be rewarded Over  reviews in here show you this film has enough to offer or at least take a look Now that this restored version is available check it out!,7
594,tt0017136,OK first of all Im not some kind of actionjunkie who thinks that the Rambotrilogy is the best movies of all time I am a person who think that other silents like Nosferatu and The Battleship Potemkin are entertainingAlthough I loved the previous movies referred to I thought this was one of the most dull movies ever As entertainment this movie cant go very far On a scale rating its abilities to entertain it gets a / from meAs a milestone in the history of movies it goes all the way to the top The special effects were great to have been made almost  years ago The editing was great It must have been one of the most expensive movie made to that date On the scale of how important a chapter in the cinematic history this is I will rate it a / That means a total / This also means that you should rather check out really good silents like Chaplins Modern Times Eisensteins The Battleship Potemkin and Murnaus Nosferatu,8
595,tt0017136,Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium and his  opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format a fully restored print on the KINO DVD filled with intertitles to keep the story complete that had me appreciate it more but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music ie Giorgio Moroders experimental cut it would still be affecting At the core of the story Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou the sides of good vs evil or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak is set up so strongly that even when it has its fairytale type of heaviness to it it doesnt seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults This is the kind of film that should work for anyone young and old as it deals with universal themes ie The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!The story leaves room for the visual style to come through Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis Joh Frederson He feels the sorrow and pain of the people and goes down to their level to be one of them He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women Maria played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm in multiple roles she plays without a fault who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freders father Enter the robot a marvel of a mad scientist who gets transposed from Maria and becomes the havocwrecker of the part of Metropolis I wont reveal too much of the story except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lapAmidst in all of this Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects cameratricks and of course editing if I wouldnt quite rank Metropolis in my alltime top ten favorites I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day cars moving on roads built to the sky airplanes flying everywhich way and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways But its not just the use of the models or the sets or the backdrops or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Langs shots which are all spectacular its also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene it also appears in other scenes I think Its little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages the superimpositions of faces and eyes in the dreamlike shotsAnd of course Langs greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story he goes beyond his time period in stylizing As I mentioned with the pacing being unique it was surprising though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M that many of the suspense sequences mob scenes/riots chases I knew that this is the same kind of styling thats used today for many of the most modern of sciencefiction/action films In its own way much like Stanley Kubricks  Space Oddysey it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling while not completely abandoning the storytelling form Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries and it hasnt been seen in its full form in almost eighty years what remains doesnt seem at all dated or crude Quite the opposite its visual expressiveness its use of time and character and action and its deliberate pacing makes it ahead of its time and influential and at the same time keeping itself unique Its a tale were all familiar with being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial cruel world which Im sure was even more relevant to post WW Germany at the time filmed with a mix of overthetop melodrama megabudget setpieces and designs that confound the senses Add the appropriate music and youve got a classic fantasy A tremendous film to see two three a dozen times over though some of those too impatient for films without spoken words or by the operatic dramatic side of it all may become disappointed or frustrated,10
596,tt0017136,For many years the initially flopped and consequently butchered Metropolis Fritz Lang made in the mid twenties of the past century could be appreciated at least for its qualities as the indispensable sciencefiction trailblazer in motion picture history What was severely lacking from the plot however finally emerged on screen again after the famous Buenos Aires reel find which brought a quarter of what was missing from the film back from the dead With the new painstaking  restoration effort also came a grandiose symphony orchestra studio recording of the original Gottfried Huppertz score  and the results make movie buffs prone to be blown away and this time for realThe technical brilliance and visual lavishness of Fritz Langs oeuvre was always undisputed already at its time and only matched by fellow German Murnaus ingenious approaches on filmmaking Theres so much and dense imagery that generations of future filmmakers would draw from this newly emerging archetype Among the unforgettable scenes are the giant heart machine which turns into a moloch in one of the heros visions the Babel tower teeming with utopian life the enormous sets elevators and masses and masses of enslaved and rebellious people the staggering creation of the first robot all set against the dominant dichotomy between  literally  those living above and those dying below There are echoes of communism here of nazi ideology of the dangers and abysses of industrialization technology and there are also glimpses of humanity Not perfect in all its components the film nevertheless has everything pioneering in it  and more Fritz Lang while having some reservations himself referred to the picture as a signpost for new destinations and thats exactly what it became now that we can look at the great scifi pictures of the past century In them and through them Metropolis still lives and once we revisit the original again we might yet be surprised that it miraculously still points ahead,10
597,tt0017925,Probably Buster Keatons best film and oddly enough its not even a straightforward comedy  its actually an action film with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure  `The General which is set during the Civil War is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray Buster Keaton of course who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army    and is turned down because the army feels hed be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier  However through a series of misunderstandings both Johnnys family and his girl think hes a coward and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier  Months pass and Johnny sad and alone is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North  Johnnys efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girls love  become an unbelievably funny and actionpacked series of events as Johnny tries to go from being a sadsack buffoon to being a heroIf you havent watched many silent films they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive as hes fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye  While funny Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well  His timing whether for a joke or for a tender moment is absolutely impeccableWhats also great about `The General is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldnt be made today  No amount of insurance would cover it  Keaton does all his own stunts and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General with a bike he sits on a moving cattlecatcher knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own  All these stunts are fantastic but its scary to think that any one of these probably couldve killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong  ,9
598,tt0017925,Buster Keaton once said that if he hadnt been a comedian he might have been a civil engineer He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics Its no wonder he adored trains the most elegant of machines and brought them into his movies whenever he could When one of Keatons former gagwriters loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this page of history to life His first certainty was that the production had to be so authentic it hurts He even insisted on using historically accurate narrowgauge railroad tracks which he found along with appropriate landscapes near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove OregonMost importantly the area had stretches of parallel tracks which allowed scenes of Buster on his trainagilely scrambling over the cars balancing on the roof to scan the horizon chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind himto be filmed from another train running alongside Buster his train and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Busters hair while smoky pinecovered hills rise and fall around him These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures and they put to shame all later backprojection and process shots models and computergenerated effects The quality of Keatons filmmaking is simplypun intendedunparalleled Every shot in The General is clean fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times The film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional just like the grave masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniformsThe Generals narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look Like a train it stays on track never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline Adapting the historical incident Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train Johnnie Gray rather than one of the raiders As he saw immediately The General is one long chase or rather two chases structured like the flight of a boomerang First Johnnie on a borrowed train the Texas chases his own stolen train the General He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines pursued by the raiders in the Texas who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high commandThe General is not Keatons funniest film but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs A number of the gags like the boxcar that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks have a long buildup for a relatively modest payoff But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings The cannon attached to the back of Busters train goes off just as the train starts around a curve so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders train coming out of the curve Riding on the cowcatcher Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his trains wheels so lost in thought he doesnt notice when the train starts to move carrying him up and down in gentle arcs stillness in motionI agree with author Jim Kline who describes The General as Keatons most personal film the one that best captures his unique vision spirit and personality In many of his films Buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero But his competent ingenious and athletic character in The General who is also modest tireless and underestimated comes much closer to his real nature There is a shot in The General of Busters eye isolated on screen framed by a hole in a white tablecloth that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertovs kinoglaz the cameraeye Keaton melds with his camera; theres no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies They have the same silence the same strictness the same strange blend of gravity and humorThe General might be the most serious comedy every made but its not a tragicomedy That as in Chaplins blending of pathos and low humor was something people took to immediately But no one knew what to make of The General Original reviews accused the film of being dull pretentious unoriginal and unfunny Even today people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing The General is challenging because it doesnt flaunt its virtues; like Keatons concise and economical performance it holds a great deal in reserve Take the movies most famous shot of a train crashing through a burning bridge for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film he doesnt dwell on it or hype it Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience never manipulates never overplays He doesnt show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents nor does he play for sympathy Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold But for those who can see the expressiveness of Busters socalled stone face who get his peculiar dry humor who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated Buster Keaton always has more than hes showing; you can see it in his eyes,10
599,tt0017925,It is generally or should I pun and say General Lee? said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keatons career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past but getting the correct rolling stock costumes weapons and props to make it look correct And it worked so well that Keaton never really could despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR outdo it In fact the closest thing to his best sound film or film that he influenced that was a sound film was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE where he returned to a Civil War themeTHE GENERAL as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE is based on the Andrews Raiders stealing of the Confederate locomotive The General and an attached train which was used to damage tracks and bridges The raid in February  was from northern Georgia into Tennesee It only lasted  miles as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial Others went to southern prisoner of war camps The effect of the incident far outstripped its military success The damage after all could be repaired But like Jimmy Doolittles Raid over Tokyo in April  it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky/Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhileDespite it being a brief incident of the war the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south When Lesney did it famous series of Models of Yesteryear the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was The GeneralThe story however was ultimately a downer But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period First he changes the viewers perspective  it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men but on the Confederates Secondly he builds up the story of Johnny Gray a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier Because Keatons family and girl friend Marion Mack see he is not enlisted they believe he turned cowardJohnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake the General from the raiders and the film has actually two chases in it  first Andrews and his men stealing the train and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking itAlong the way are many comic classic moments such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train or when at a moment of dejection Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase and finding Marion Mack there helping him are wonderful  especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired she throws away the ugly little ones Keatons reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful momentThe classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river and the burning of the railroad bridge with its destruction of a second locomotive It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history By the way the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest He was Mike Turkey Strut Donlin a frequent member and starring player of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the th Century Donlin who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases left baseball to become a film actor he had worked a bit in vaudeville Keaton was a sports fan and showed this in his film COLLEGE where he shows his abilities in several sports and hired Donlin This was the latters most famous performance  look at his reaction to the collapseIt must be regarded as Keatons finest film and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures,10
600,tt0017925,No one will top Keaton for physical risk and risk is what deep film experiences are all about This might be classed as a comedy but for me it touches deeply enough Its about a man who needs to prove himself by taking risks and being true And its by a man who takes even greater risks and is more true True to the spirit of the social compact here displayed as the chummy southHes always done stunts that amaze Many of his other films have things in them that if the timing were only a little off hed be seriously injured or die But this takes the cake Its almost as if he started with the idea that hed have three locos to play with and had a year to think up stunts And the stunts are so physical! And so dangerous And so so very effective His trademark is the deadpan face placed as a sort of innocent cluelessness Its particularly funny when you see the physical movements and you know that  they take incredible preparation and timing to pull off and  the fellow you see that looks so puzzled by the reality you see is the guy that devised and directed those stuntsTeds Evaluation   of  Worth watching,0
601,tt0017925,I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number # on the  version of AFIs Top  Movies of all time list It didnt make the cut at all for the original compilation in  so even before seeing the picture I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion I usually line up with the majority in most cases but I have to admit I dont quite get it with this picture I found it entertaining enough on occasion but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way its heralded on the DVD sleeve I dont think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy so right there my expectations were greatly reduced Keatons somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition dont help On the flip side I wouldnt have expected slapstick to move the story along either so at least I wasnt disappointed in that regardWhat I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity When Johnnie Gray Keaton dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army and pondered his situation while sitting on the trains connecting rod the resulting visual was pure genius The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnies thoughtful reverie and was one of the highlights of the picture for meThe other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge For starters I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb  unbelievableOh yes and I cant forget the sequence where Keatons marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a preCGI world its difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own For that Keaton deserves accoladesIn between all this clever film making however I just wasnt inspired The central plot element doesnt hold up for me  if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer why wasnt he simply told the reason why One could argue that then you wouldnt have a picture but for me it left the story on a shaky footing If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier the picture might have taken a different approach but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero Maybe Im second guessing a master but thats what I come away withConclusion  if this movie didnt make AFIs Top  Film List in  I dont understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top  At the same time Chaplins City Lights in my estimation a superior silent film fell OFF the list while The Gold Rush moved up a few notches I may not be a professional but I know what I like and this one just didnt do it for me,7
602,tt0017925,Buster Keatons The General about a man and his engine puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen From major comic situations to throwaway gags The General always knows what to doThe story begins in leisurely fashion A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray Keaton has two loves in his life his engine and his girlrespectively The General and Annabelle Lee Marion Mack Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle followed by two engineerworshipping boys and unknown to him Annabelle Lee herself He and his entourage arrive at the door; Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs slicks back his hair and gently taps the door with the door knocker Then he turns to notice Annabelle Keatons understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness Any other comedian would have done an explosive doubletakeNow Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor but the boys are there too Johnnie stands up puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave The heroworshippers are ready to follow but Johnnie lets them out first then closes the door on them This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pantsNow the two are alone Annabelles father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon the War Between the States has begun Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist then turns expectantly to Johnnie who cocks his head like a confused puppy She asks Arent you going to enlist? Realization hits him and he leaps off the seat Before he can run out the door Annabelle kisses him This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porchJohnnie races to the general store which is now a makeshift recruitment office Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation but the man rejects him Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer Later Annabelle believes that Johnnie didnt even try to enlist She refuses to speak to him again until hes in uniform What follows is a classic moment Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine Hes so miserable that he doesnt notice when he starts moving up and down until just before the train enters a tunnelTime passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General When nearly everyone is off the train having dinner the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine Annabelle a passenger herself was still on board She is now their prisonerBut Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen possibly by deserters He pursues the engine by taking another The Texas Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas but the Unionists think theyre outnumbered and continue to run What follows is the true joy of the movie two long chases separated by an important plot twist Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop actionI love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas At one point the car which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track reappears in front of the baffled engineer only to disappear later just as mysteriously We see the logical circumstances that lead to the cars seeming magic act and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied preventing him from seeing what we seeComic logic is important to The General In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable In a throwaway gag Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for itWe move to the second chase where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle LeeMarion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was She has hilarious moments The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire She takes a small stick and daintily puts it in Johnnie sarcastically hands her a sliver and she puts that in too Then in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping Johnnie grabs her and halfthrottles her before kissing her insteadThe final section most of it a battle scene includes the shot where The Texas begins to cross a burning bridge only to crash into the river Owing to Keatons disdain of fakery one of several reasons his works seem modern he did not use a model but a real train on a real burning bridge The crash cost $reportedly making it the single most expensive shot ever in a silent filmA worthy closing gag was too taxing even for Keatons ingenuity Johnnies dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers His remedy is only mildly funny Is anyone complaining? The General is a work of art and a work of genius,0
603,tt0017925,This film flopped when it was released in late  for several reasons First its premiere was delayed because Flesh and the Devil was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks Second people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian not Buster the filmmaker and director which is more of the role he played here The film was funny but it was not gag after gag like so many of Keatons other films Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South A title card declares he has two loves  his girl and his engine when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession His girlfriend misunderstands thinks him a coward and says she wont speak to him again until he is in uniformMeanwhile the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Busters train Unknown to Buster his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train still without the knowledge of his girls captivity by the Union armyForgotten with the arrival of sound the film revived  often cut up from its original length  in the s because Buster didnt preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today often with poor video and hideous musical accompanimentToday The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too SHERLOCK JR is clever OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious The General is both of these things Its story driven races to a climax and is fueled by cute clever inventive gagsBuster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in A Southern Yankee,9
604,tt0017925,One of the great masterpieces of cinema Buster Keatons The General combines inventive humor with terrific action and fine melodrama all beautifully and carefully planned and photographed  It is filled with subtle and wonderful details that make it well worth devoting your full attention to watching  As an extra bonus it offers a fascinating look at the Civil War era with many realistic details inspired by a historical incidentAfter a short opening sequence the movie divides nicely into two halves Johnny Keaton is a railway engineer turned down in his attempts to enlist in the Confederate Army and subsequently rejected by his girl  Continuing with the railroad one day his locomotive is stolen by Union spies who also kidnap his girl  Johnny first chases the engine into Union territory to recapture it and then is himself chased by the Northern Army as he attempts to return home  Both chases are filled with excitement and manic fun with some breathtaking stunts by Keaton thrown in  It all leads up to a dramatic and memorable climax that includes many ironic and suggestive touchesKeaton is at his best with the story offering him a perfect showcase for his many talents  His slapstick and acrobatic skills are given free rein and his characters stoic perseverance is a fine complement to the frantic actionThis belongs near the top of any list of great films a classic worth watching and rewatching,0
605,tt0017925,I havent had so much fun watching a movie for a long time The General is a silent comedy mostly slapstick about Johnny Gray a train engineer with two loves his engine and Annabelle Lee Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer Things are then sped up a year where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan As it so happens they steal Johnnys engine a big mistakeBuster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies but of course less old He is often ignorant of what is going on around him leading to plenty of laughs This also makes him a very charismatic characterThere are countless train related jokes The first one comes right at the beginning when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman in a line much like a train The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment The finale is explosiveThe General was a lot of fun to watch It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies and had plenty of substance on top of that This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever After my first viewing it instantly became one of my favorites It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies,10
606,tt0017925,THE GENERAL represents the greatest achievement screen comedy ever accomplished From the brilliant gag construction to the sheer excellence of the filmmaking technique THE GENERAL is a hilarious and amazing journey into comedy Written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman Keaton brings brilliant gags into the story The film begins when Keaton is told he is of no use to the South as a soldier but as a train engineer However his girlfriend refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform After the war has started the girl is kidnapped by some Union raiders on Keatons train and so begins the greatest and funniest chase ever filmed For the next  minutes the viewer is in Keatons world His gags routines and amazing slapstick serve to make this the greatest screen comedy ever filmedMatt age ,0
607,tt0017925,Ive seen one other silent movie in my life but it was Mel Brookss The Silent Movie so I dont know if it really counts I really enjoyed The General overall more than I thought I would as someone who was born after The GodfatherThe main thing that surprised me was the fact that I couldnt look down to write very many notes; any time I took my eyes off the screen I ran a serious risk of missing something It seems to me that the film even though it was long or seemed so it was very dense in terms of action I imagine that since the movie has no dialogue the filmmakers must make up for it by making it as visually interesting and entertaining as possible I am accustomed to more modern movies with snappy dialogue and special effects and suchmovies in which you can look down at your popcorn or kiss your date and not miss too much because you can hear pretty much whats happening This was a nice change for meObviously Ive never seen a Buster Keaton film and Im not even sure if Id heard of him before this class But I can see why he is so appealing in his films I loved his facial expressions particularly the stoicbutcrestfallen look in his eyes on the train when something else goes wrong He also has great control of his body as we discussed in class and a fine sense of comic timingI found the film surprisingly funny Many modern films that I think are funny eg Austin Powers Toy Story American Beauty rely largely on witty or outrageous dialogue for their humor As a silent film The General must rely mainly on images for its humorthe slapstick images of Johnnie falling over constantly the unusual image of Johnnie riding up and down on the crossbar between the train wheels the stereotype exploitation in the scene when the girl sweeps out the locomotive Im sure that some of the things that I considered amusing might not have been considered funny by the original audience such as the recordscratch lightning bolts,0
608,tt0017925, Georgia USA The American Civil War is in its second year and Johnnie Gray is barred from enlisting He is a train engineer and the Confederate Army feel he is more valuable to the Southern cause in his current role than in the army This frustrates Johnnie and has estranged him from his sweetheart Annabelle who views him as a coward Then his beloved engine The General is stolen by Union spies and is heading for Union lines Moreover Annabelle is on board Johnnie sets off after the two loves of his lifeGreat comedy from the silent era directed and starring one of the greatest comedy directors and actors of that era Buster Keaton This is a rollicking adventure complete with wonderfully thoughtout and performed physical comedy and other sight gags Some very clever use of the plot to generate the comedyThe plot itself isnt overly profound but crams in a lot of action and adventure plus some romanceVery entertaining,8
609,tt0017925,THE GENERAL When one watches for the first time the General great things happen laughter relief a neverending smileand that old sniff of old good cinema I must admit not many films out there give the pleasure this one has It is like everything just falls right into place Overall the movie is a perfect account of all the things that make comedy great Simplicity good and twisted plot a sense of the unexpected becoming more and more realDo you feel me dont you? It has been attributed to Chalie Chaplin the following sentence to make a comedy film you only need three things a park a woman and a police officer We can safely say The General stands up to it Well there is no park in The General although the landscape is used wisely but theres a woman As for the police officerwell not exactly What we do have in the film are soldiers Im afraid of telling you the plot of the story because I dont want to spoil anything I reckon itd be better if you find it out for yourselves Well lets just say that Buster Keaton plays the main character an engineer whose beloved locomotive has been stolen by Union spies From that point on he does everything in his power to get it back Theres nothing more for me to say butEnjoy yourselves!!,8
610,tt0017925,To watch The General is to be both awed and amused at what takes place The consensus view is correct This is an amazing movieYou know whats more amazing? Despite what most critics say Buster Keaton made funnier better films than thisKeaton a lifelong railroad buff is engineer Johnny Gray captain of The General a locomotive which carries passengers and freight across the American South When the Civil War breaks out he tries to enlist and thus please his girl Annabelle Lee Marion Mack but the authorities deem him more useful running trains When Union spies seize the General with an idea of using it to burn bridges and disrupt the Confederate supply line its up to Gray to save the dayNew York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall reviewed The General back in  and expressed disappointment This is by no means so good as Mr Keatons previous efforts he wrote People cite Halls review as a classic example of whatdocriticsknow but the more I read the more I agreed with him The fun is not exactly plentiful he wrote noting Keaton here was too much the acrobat too little the clownWhen I watched The General I felt disappointment too Like Halls it wasnt total; its exciting and inventive and boasts some of the finest screen compositions Ive ever seen The technical expertise on display is astounding Its just that the overall experience left me a bit flatFirst you have what Roger Ebert liked to call the idiot plot Gray tries to enlist and is rejected by the army because hes too valuable as a train engineer Annabelle apparently never learns this for she rejects him as a coward I dont want you to speak to me again until youre in uniform she huffsEither hes an idiot for not explaining the truth of the matter or shes an idiot for preferring her lover be cannon fodder than a real asset to their cause Anyway Buster does manage to make this play later on When he finally speaks to her he is in uniform an enemy uniformThe other main issue involves what Lincoln called the slows A lot of the story is literally trainwatching Buster does some brave amazing stuntwork and throws in some clever gags later joined by Mack whos no Sibil Seely but still quite game but its basically a lot of watching trains go by The craft here is in the precision of the camerawork and the splitsecond timing not so much the comedy In fact except for Buster himself everyone plays it completely straight probably because this is real history being presented Compared to other Keaton comedies it feels a bit straitjacketed by thatThe General is still a solid thrill comedy with some amusing one liners If you lose this war dont blame me Johnny yells after being rejected and brilliant sight gags like the fussy Annabelles rejection of unattractive firewood while Buster struggles to stoke the engineTo me thats enough for The General to be another good reason for loving Buster Keaton I just cant understand it being the preeminent reason Maybe critics cant really love a comedy for just making you laugh and laugh Im just glad Keaton made other movies at least as brilliant as The General and funnier too,7
611,tt0017925,Buster Keaton s performance in The General was purely enjoyable The story takes place during the civil war on centers on Johnnie Gray Keaton a train operator in the South Johnnie is not accepted for service in the confederate army because of his value on the railroad and suffers the shame of being home while the other men are fighting a war When his beloved engine is hijacked by Union soldiers the unpredictable story goes into overdrive Johnnies adventure includes train chases rescuing the love of his life a daring escape and a climactic battle This film has a distinct action/adventure aspect but at its core it is a brilliant comedy/drama Keatons performance is superb He has the ability to effortlessly change your mood and the mood of the film with his facial expressions and physical comedy Keatons character seems to make endless mistakes that work for the best and good decisions in dangerous situations It is easy to imagine Keaton as a major influence for a future comedians and I personally felt like I was watching the Mel Brooks of a previous generation The General was a fun film to watch with a true star Buster Keaton turning in a timeless heartfelt performance,7
612,tt0017925,When watching The General  the similarities between Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin are almost unmistakable The story was original and humorous and the performance by Buster Keaton was pleasing What I didnt like was the fact that the protagonist still was pursuing the girl who was so quick to leave him when she thought he wasnt brave and then ends up staying with her at the end He is too good for her I thought the stunt where the bridge gives out and the train falls was very well done and must have cost a fortune There were scenes where I found myself laughing out loud and scenes where I was bored So unfortunately the film doesnt do a great job at keeping the viewer glued to the screen but overall it was enjoyable,7
613,tt0017925,I feel the The General is a great silent film because even though the story line is relatively complicated the way in which each character played their part and the way it was filmed made it easy to follow I am fairly new to the silent film experience and when I saw that this movie was partially a comedy I was expecting something more along the lines of Charlie Chaplin however I was pleasantly surprised at Buster Keatons more subtle comedic style I felt that the film was well shot shot considering the technology of the day I was actually shocked during the scene where the Rock River Bridge collapsed under The Texas Knowing full well it was not special effects I couldnt believe the producers would spare the expense of destroying a locomotive and an entire bridge This movie is sure to be one of my favorite silent films,7
614,tt0017925,Buster Keaton always amazes me He was truly one of the most hilarious deadpan screen clowns of early cinema And The General even clocking in at around three hours is surprisingly watchable based on his physical performance aloneGranted I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything thats unnecessary but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments There are multiple points in the General a story about a Southern engineer that has to rescue his beloved from the clutches of the North in the Civil War where Keatons character Johnnie Gray has to stop his train jump out and remove something from the tracks which in itself can be quite boring but the way that Keaton injects physical comedy into those moments keeps me entertainedAnd its a marvel how so many realistic yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with Its nothing fantastic like some of his other films but its still funny And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversitybut he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and its just enough to know that he is frightened but that the rest of him doesnt react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny Whether hes pratfalling due to surprise or erroneously succeeding at something hes unskilled in and being shocked by it that response of his is winningBut the General does show its age a little It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesnt get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context I wouldnt dare cut those moments out of this film even if I could reedit it because the space always had something going on but at the same time this film if made today would be cut to oneandahalf or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly The plot and story are simple but exist more than to just help the comedy move alongexcept at the end when the first story was accomplished Then we move into a second extraneous but still amusing story regarding a battle between the North and the South that couldve been excised and still having a decent though simple storyI didnt really love the score that the DVD company attached to it which is a number of classical pieces end on end I think a new commissioned soundtrack wouldve better matched the piece but I guess we get what we get And on the plus side you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of itIs it perfect? No But despite the age it shows it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinemas greatest physical comedians If you want to spend three hours with a silent clown this is not a bad way to go /,8
615,tt0017925,Have a lot of appreciation for comedy especially the witty and sophisticated kinds and there are a good deal of classic comedies that go for the broad approach too Am significantly less keen though on the vulgar puerile style of humour that is seen quite a lot today the worst of it veering on the offensive There are many instances of silent films/comedies seen with Charlie Chaplin prime Laurel and Hardy and with Buster KeatonKeaton is seen as one of the greats by many but for some reason doesnt seem to be quite as well known even with a just as good reputation critically as Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy who transitioned better into sound maybe when at his best in the s an extraordinary period with a deservedly lauded reputation he was every bit as great as funny and as likeable His daring physical comedy and stoic deadpan expressions were unique and ahead of its time at the time and still amaze and are distinct now plus he was a bigger risktaker with bolder material and immense courage that most wish they could have Which perhaps hasnt been more apparent than in this film The General often considered one of his best and most important films or even his masterpiece though with other just as worthy efforts it has been debated and justifiably so This paragraph is very subjective of course and probably wont be agreed with but that is just my respectful stanceThe General to this day still looks great and remarkably lavish something of a technical achievement in its day It also should be used as an example of how to have effects that still look good and like a lot of effort and care went into them and also use them properly rather than overusing and abusing them to gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now The locomotive features heavily here and to ingenious and quite imaginative effect The direction keeps the momentum going with ease and balances all The Generals elements every bit as adeptlyWhen it comes to the humour which is very physical it is never less than very funny and is timed inventively throughout no corniness at all and it gels very well But The General is much more than just a comedy and one can say that its not really one It has other elements too and executes them even better actually especially the action the scope dexterity and boldness of it and especially those stunts absolutely jawdropping and truly exciting to watch It is also an example of how to have action that thrills while being easy on the eyes coherent and not being too noisy or busy something to learn fromAlso here is a tender understated quality that is very surprising and the romantic element is genuinely charming without being sappy The film also has a story thats easy to follow and at the same time is logical and interesting indicating a film with brains as well as soul that treats the viewer with respect rather than getting irritated by credibility straining and logic lapses Keaton is superb here not only is his comic timing on point but he provides a character thats endearing and worth rooting for His physicality and how he copes with the stunts is aweinspiring and he is one of not many to make deadpan interesting and entertaining because he still makes it very expressive and nuanced The rest of the cast are easy to overlook but are just as strong even if with not as much to do or with material that sticks in the mind as muchOverall brilliant and a Buster Keaton essential / Bethany Cox,10
616,tt0017925,There are some truly wonderful scenes in this film which is full of adventure comedy and some pretty impressive stuntwork on moving trains by Buster Keaton and the other actors The premise is that Keaton a train conductor has volunteered to fight for the South at the outset of the Civil War but been turned down When his train is stolen by Union soldiers he immediately gives chase on foot then a handcar briefly a bicycle and then finally another train not knowing quite yet that his girlfriend Marion Mack was inadvertently also kidnappedIn one of the memorable early scenes Keaton is sitting on the connecting rod of the locomotive lost in thought when it starts up bobbing him up and down In another he packs a cannon on his train with a massive charge and as its angle slowly descends before firing it appears hes going to blow himself up until his train at the last minute hits a curve and he nearly hits his intended target Its just wonderful There is also of course the scene with a Union train going out onto a burning bridge which then collapses one of the most iconic and expensive scenes of the eraIn addition to those big moments there are also innumerable little things Keaton does which highlight his genius He is just so lovable and talented He uses one of the large railroad ties intended to derail him to knock another off the track as his train is moving When hes hiding under a table surrounded by Union officers hes subtly kicked and jostled in funny ways As he makes his escape with Mack he stuffs her into a large sack that he had emptied of shoes only to lose his own shoe in the process and struggle to locate it I also thought I saw bits of Woody Allen in the scene where he urges her to be quiet only to knock things over and make noise himselfAmbitious aweinspiring influential clever and still funny + years later Is it the best ever? I dont know I liked The Cameraman  even more but still – damn good,9
617,tt0017925,Buster Keaton is Johnnie Gray a southerner who wants to fight for the cause but gets rejected because he could be of more use as an engineer than as a soldier Unfortunately hes not told why he was turned down and his gal just assumes that hes a coward Not so because when a Yankee scallywag steals his beloved steam engine the titular The General Johnnie heads north to recover the engine and through a series of misadventures becomes a hero of the Confederacy and rescues Annabelle Lee Glorious sight gags abound as Old Stone Face deals with errant cannon loose sword blades uncooperative firewood inexplicable soakings and a lessthanhelpful rescuee not to mention an entire army of bluebellies Great fun from another era and a wonderful example of the silent genre,8
618,tt0017925,Buster Keaton plays the lead in this silent era masterpiece that takes its inspiration from the Great Locomotive Chase which in turn was a real event during the American Civil War in which a train was stolen by the North and sped over the lines in preparation for the coming offenseThe General has some definitive upsides working in its favour Buster Keaton is an amazingly versatile performer able to go from clownish jokester to a saddened victim of war and poor circumstances in a heartbeat The film is also really ambitious in scope Keaton performs all of his stunts most of them hairraisingly dangerous and completely unimaginable nowadays Plus very little money is spared and the film famously has some of the most expensive set pieces and stunts of the silent eraThe plot of the film is also a lot more cohesive than say in the films made by Charlie Chaplin in the same decade Chaplins films usually contain segments that have little to do with anything except the need for funny situations The General is also a comedy but with a clear clean story arcOn the other hand I didnt find the humour or the characters as captivating Theyre okay but in this regard the decades of cultural development between the film and yours truly work against the film I just didnt find the slapstick all that funnyStill The General is a great watch for all interested in early cinema or really involved physical humour,0
619,tt0017925,The General is one of the great films and treasures of the silent era Its among the best movies of the talented comedy actor Buster Keaton In this film Keaton shows the athletic ability and courage that made him one of the best of the early comedians who performed their own stunts His physical antics on and off his train The General support his title as king of comedy stunts All the silent era comedy actors seemed to have lots of energy And many had daring courage and even madness at times Those were the actors who did all or most of their own stunts While there were some stunt men around in the early s it wasnt until the last of the silent years and dawn of sound pictures that stuntmen were a regular part of the cast of films that required any amount of derringdo And while a small number of actors today will still do some of their own stunts nothing can compare to the actors of old who performed their own highrisk and dangerous stunts – and sometimes those for other actors The five best early actors at doing stunts were Buster Keaton Douglas Fairbanks Sr Harold Lloyd Tom Mix and Yakima Canutt The latter two specialized in Westerns and besides acting and doing stunt work Mix and Canutt regularly rode and performed in the rodeo circuit Lloyd was versatile in his venues but excelled at high stunts on buildings and sometimes with wild animals Fairbanks excelled in swashbuckler stunts sliding down the sails of ships swinging from anything hanging aloft and jumping with the help of trampolines into windows Keaton was even more versatile As a child actor in vaudeville Keaton learned how to fall to avoid injury He called his technique soft falls or landings But even with his training and practice his film roles with derringdo often left him bruised at the least At other times he had suffered injuries from slight to serious Still he had become known for his physical resiliency During the filming of The General in  Keaton was knocked unconscious by canon fire He suffered a broken ankle while filming the  short The Electric House And he broke his neck during the  shooting of Sherlock Jr but didnt know it until years later This movie has an interesting plot set during the US Civil War It opens with a scene and script that reads The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marietta Georgia in the spring of  The train seems to be traveling about  miles per hour But the film is almost entirely about action and the comedy in the action involving the train There is an element of romance The cast all are very good The photography is superb Much of the action with trains is filmed in Westcentral Oregon from Eugene to Cottage Grove Theres no information about sound at all so I assume the music we hear with the film is soundtrack that was added for modern viewing It probably is meant to replicate the piano accompaniment that was usual with silent films in theaters of the day This is one instance when I think the piano playing would have been better The music seems to go overboard at times This is one of the early great films from the silent era that showcase the talent and early mastery of moviemaking skills Its a fun movie with strong visuals that even a modern family of all ages should enjoy,10
620,tt0017925,Johnnie Gray a train engineer tries to enlist in the Confederate Army to impress his girlfriend Unfortunately he is rejected because his role as engineer is deemed more important Lucky for Gray he is given the opportunity to prove himself when a band of Union soldiers in disguise hijack a trainAt the time of this films release it was a flop and considered to be not very funny Since then it has gone on to be declared one of the greatest films of all time Funny how that works I would tend to agree that it isnt really very funny but it is a great film for a variety of reasonsBuster Keaton was an amazing actor and director He was willing to put himself in dangerous situations for a laugh  he was his own stuntman right there when the train falls in the water really sitting on the side of a moving train and on the front of it he could have been killed And this was captured on film flawlesslyPersonally I enjoyed his Sherlock Jr better I thought the tricks were better and the action funnier It had a faster pace too that kept me hooked enough to watch it a few times The General was not boring but as a silent film it could have done more to grab the audience and Im not sure that it did,7
621,tt0021749,If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend as others have pointed to in the past City Lights is the one Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies like Modern Times and The Gold Rush City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest his bravest his most romantic and his most sympathetic Its tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters but its pulled off The film centers on three characters the Tramp the quintessential funny homeless man who blends into the crowd but gets caught in predicaments He helps a drunken businessman Myers a fine performance in his own right from suicide and becomes his on and off again friend that is when it suits him and doesnt notice his friends state The other person in the Tramps life is the Blind Flower Girl Virginia Cherrill one of the most absorbing beautiful and key female performances in silent film who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money which leads to a how else can I put it magical boxing match where its basically a  from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull Though there is no dialog the film achieves a timelessness its essentially a tale of two loners who find each other lose each other and find each other again the last scene widely discussed by critics for decades is moving if not tearinducing And its never ever boring once you get along with the Tramp you find the little things about him the reaction shots the little things he does after the usual big gag look to the ballroom scene for examples of this or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing Truth be told if this film makes you indifferent never watch Chaplin again But if you give yourself to the film you may find its one of the most charming from the era or perhaps any era,10
622,tt0021749,Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplins City Lights a masterpiece Its only  minutes long but they are among the best  minutes you could spend at the movies and the last five minutes are simply exquisite Keep your Kleenex box at arms length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says Yes I can see now the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanationChaplin was at his zenith in  when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story and the Little Tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade He had already made the classics The Gold Rush  and The Circus  starring his character so its obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time The advent of talkies didnt stop Chaplin from making this Comedy Romance in Pantomime as he subtitled it as he knew giving the Little Tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character What I particularly enjoyed in this film is how the Little Tramp fancies himself as a wellmannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down even going to prison for love It is this selfdelusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl played in an effectively plaintive manner by Virginia Cherrill Her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable Simply compare her to the screen test shown of Georgia Hale Chaplins leading lady in The Gold Rush and an obviously more experienced actress than Cherrill as Hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the Little Tramp is the wealthy gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sightOf course this would not be a Chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes  the rising and lowering of the street elevator the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers and was according to the footage included as a DVD extra inspired by an earlier Chaplin short The Champion from  Even a simple moment for example when the Little Tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment And special mention needs to go to Chaplins musical score where he beautifully interweaves José Padillas La Violetta as his love themeThe transfer to DVD is very good and the DVD set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality The Serge Bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film and the footage of Chaplin from a Vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the longforgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then The aforementioned Georgia Hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long The minute home movie of Chaplins trip to Bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise Regardless the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies Chaplins reputation as one of the worlds leading filmmakers,10
623,tt0021749,This is my favorite Chaplin film but I dont want that to diminish his other work either MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick and even the largelyneglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone Chaplin didnt make a bad movie and Im not even sure that CL is his best exactly But it IS my favorite if only for the endingThat ending has been the subject of much comment here I think its a masterpiece in a single scene Chaplins little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living breathing human being Its a monument to understated sentimentalityTo me the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid Yes the boxing scene is great and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful but its that ending that makes us all love this movie,0
624,tt0021749,Once again Chaplin plays his famous creation the beloved Tramp The noble Little Fellow meets and falls in love with a blind flower girl She assumes he is wealthy man and offers him a flower which he attentively accepts with his last penny One night by chance he rescues a drunken millionaire from drowning The rich gentleman becomes a generous friend when drunk but doesnt recognize the tramp when sober Chaplin takes the blind girl under his wing and takes flight with the millionaires money to cure her blindness City Lights engaged a true genius in a graceful and touching performance which arouses profound feelings and joy with great simplicity of style and tragic tale Each scene was the result of hardworking detail and planning,9
625,tt0021749,Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights and the results are spectacular The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights and even though Charlies performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant City Lights is so well made that it is one of the very few movies in which the obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked Yes you can clearly see the string holding Chaplin up in the sidesplittingly funny boxing scene but who cares? That is such classic slapstick that little things like that really dont matter Besides lets keep in mind that this movie was made seventy years ago Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk His friendship with the drunken rich guy is hilarious but it also makes a significant comment about the problems of alcohol This is truly a great film which should not be forgotten,10
626,tt0021749,Charlie Chaplins City Lights contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it  Although made very much in the oldfashioned silent film tradition much of it is timeless tooAfter a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning Charlies little tramp character makes two acquaintances  He meets a blind girl selling flowers who mistakes him for a rich man and the two become very fond of each other Then he meets a real millionaire who is drunk depressed and about to commit suicide  In a comic scene the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it making himself a devoted friendThe tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight and tries to think of some way he could help  His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades  his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny and one of Chaplins best comic pieces Meanwhile when his millionaire friend is drunk he dotes on the tramp but when sober he forgets who the tramp is leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for CharlieAll of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the bestremembered scenes in any film  City Lights shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master who without words can move his audience or make them laugh  Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once,0
627,tt0021749,Film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia  Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are  Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation  We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new  In City Lights and other silent works of film a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere  While watching the film I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story the sets the crew; the whole project  While this may not have been the complete reality it felt that way and thus made the film more enjoyable  In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional responseSince film is at its very core a visual medium I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium  I dont use the word basic here in a demeaning sense but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance  Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced but they were and are beautiful  The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic There is a warmth found in City Lights and other Chaplin films The Kid Modern Times that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today  Maybe its just that with simplicity comes honesty and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer,0
628,tt0021749,City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of filmmaking Chaplins last silent film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the mans wealth to make her fall in love with him The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesnt recognize the tramp anymore On top of this the flower girl has to pay  dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forthThe outcome of the movie is to almost all people known It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film The movie itself still is masterpiece more than  years after its release I personally rate this as Chaplins second best I have seen so far My favorite remains The Gold Rush Still this movie gets / stars from me,9
629,tt0021749,I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplins nicest most underappreciated silent movie gems Then I discovered it really wasnt underrated; its rated very high on most critics lists It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this onePart of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that Im a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one Its a romance between Charlies tramp character no name and a blind girl who also had no name in this film Virginia Cherill who played the blind woman and had a wholesome pretty face which I found very attractiveIm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as talkies were out in full force by  Chaplin was at his best in silent movies anyway and his comedy routines are legendary He gave me a lot of laughs in this film as always and I particularly laughed I love slapstick at the boxing scene Kudos too to Harry Myers as the eccentric millionaireTheres a lot of drama as well as humor in this minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sightComedy romance drama with suffering all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment Its hard to believe this movie was not up for one single Academy Award,9
630,tt0021749,CITY LIGHTS United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  l is a silent comedydrama released at the height of the sound era Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad Chaplin gambled with this production and made it pay off Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH  as the one movie he would most want to be remembered CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time practically places his other silent masterpiece THE CIRCUS  to oblivion CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama but in Chaplins case pathosSubtitled A comedy romance in pantomime the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city After the unveiling the crowd finds a little tramp Charlie Chaplin sleeping on the lap of one of the figures As he tries to climb down he encounters one problem after another This opening scene alone is priceless With such a great beginning Chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot The theme to CITY LIGHTS is remembered mainly about a tramps love for a blind girl However there is a subplot involving the tramps involvement with a millionaire drunk which by far takes up more time than the sentimental love story These two segments actually set the pattern First segment set in the afternoon finds Charlie walking down the street examining a nude statue in a shop being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing He encounters a beautiful blonde girl Virginia Cherrill selling flowers After she drops one of her flowers Charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it thus realizing shes blind Smitten by her beauty he picks it up and pays her for it Minutes later the slamming of a limousine door is heard with the girl believing the kind gentleman Charlie to be a millionaire Second segment set at night finds Charlie encountering a drunk Harry Myers trying to commit suicide by drowning himself Just as Charlie is about to save him he in turn falls into the river The drunk in gratitude for saving his life takes Charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn By morning the millionaire now sober fails to recognize or remember Charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion This running gag thats repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious but Chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges By day Charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when shes not at her usual corner selling flowers Finding that shes ill and being cared by her grandmother Florence Lee whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction Charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs ranging from streetcleaning to fighting in a boxing match Reading in a newspaper of a European doctor who restores sight for the blind Charlie gives the girl $ for an operation the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire who after sober accuses Charlie of robbing him has his arrested and serving jail time The climatic finish is truly the best thing Chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missedFeatured in the supporting cast are Henry Bergman Allan Garcia Albert Austin and Hank Mann While much has been discussed about Chaplins performance his costar Virginia Cherrill as the blind girl no name given should not go without mention Even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor Cary Grant her performance is excellent by all means Although its been said that future film star Jean Harlow  appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence she is visible in a surviving still photograph but no such scene appears in the finished product Unlike THE GOLD RUSH CITY LIGHTS had limited showings in revival houses in later years and was never allowed to be distributed to television Being first introduced to CITY LIGHTS at New York Citys revival movie house The Regency Theater formerly located on Broadway and th Street in  the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience There was one man probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film No doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else Watching CITY LIGHTS surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in After Chaplins death in December of  CITY LIGHTS along with his other silent features were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure but became readily available on video cassette at the time of Chaplins th birthday  In later years CITY LIGHTS was frequently revived on various cable channels ranging from Turner Network Television TNT in the early s American Movie Classics up to  and finally Turner Classic Movies The complete musical soundtrack that accompanies CITY LIGHTS happens to be the original score composed to perfection by Chaplin himself Much has been written and said about CITY LIGHTS over the years To learn more about the making difficulties and long term preparations to CITY LIGHTS either watch Kevin Blownlows  documentary Hollywood A Celebration of the American Silent Film as narrated by James Mason or Brownlows other documentaries dedicated entirely to Chaplins career including outtakes to CITY LIGHTS as well as scenes involving Virginia Cherrills temporary replacement Georgia Hale Chaplins costar in THE GOLD RUSH ****,10
631,tt0021749,Spoilers hereinFor me this film falls not into the category of favorite films Im a Marx brothers kind of guy but earns instead a place on a very short list of most important moviesThats because it has two features that I truly appreciateIt is as pure a vision of its creator as is possible Nearly all other films are engineered from prior work Not so with a small list of projects from Welles Kurosawa Eisenstein  and this one project of Chaplins They are wholly original springing from some nether worldBut the other element is the one that impresses the most This film is about itself about the art of visual narrative Chaplin was intelligent enough to know that what he was doing was new The issues are centered on what the audience `sees so while he struggles with what and how the audience sees he builds that into the fabric of the storyThe primary framing is about the blind girl who falls in love with him by `seeing him in her own way Then `sees him at the end in a different way The rich man recognizes the tramp when drunk but does not when he is not Nearly all the jokes indeed every element of the film is about this same dynamic the elevator which is not seen but then was the burglars the same the Tramp on the statue on the barrel Even seeing the cigar before the bum does Even us seeing the soap and the foreman notThe `seeing is carried over to `hearing with the politician and whistle jokes And then even further as Charlie turns his back on the new technology of giving us speech and instead `shows us something else he writes and conducts an amazing score instead This is truly amazing and one reason to take Mike Figgis seriouslyNo wonder Orson Welles considered this the most important film ever made But as to the best to watch? Because film is so derivative my own gold standard for the Tramp is Robert Downeys and to some extent Depps Comic timing is something that evolves and those men make a more effective Tramp for my modern ability to seeTrivia Chaplin found the `blind girl in a group of spectators at a fight and was struck with how her expressions reflected what she saw Shes pretty as well of course but certainly not the prettiest Chaplin knew See how Chaplin separately works in both the fight a performance and her reaction to his performance in the film,0
632,tt0021749,Waddling along with his cane and derby hat and that tiny mustache the little tramp Charles Chaplin is visually unlike any character in film history The tramp is kindhearted always dignified Hes a simple soul who in City Lights tries to help out a young blind woman well played by Virginia Cherrill This is a silent film of course but the tramps body language is his speechThe really noticeable feature of the tramp character is how he blends into everyday life Hes more or less ignored by many laughed at by others The girls grandmother never sees him at all And only when the millionaire is drunk does he see the tramp as a friend Curious  and deepThe tramp gets into his fair share of trouble but only through his bumbling efforts to help the girl The boxing match is a hoot and very well choreographed as are all the skits And what a beginning for a film with city leaders spouting gibberish probably as Chaplins dig at the talkies Then the way Chaplin makes his grand entrance  just terrific!Melancholy at times the films music really tugs at your heartstrings Maybe its sentimental and manipulative But given the abiding and Zenlike qualities of the tramp some sentimentality is quite appropriate And the music is choreographed totally in sync with the plot actionProduction design is sparse and at times drab That the film was made during the Great Depression is beyond obviousComedy here is simple and effective The main character expresses heart and humanity The little tramp is an unforgettable character And City Lights is a wonderful film,10
633,tt0021749,Chaplin was a unique presence in the history of the early cinema  Coming up through the ranks he gradually achieved a godlike stature being awarded total control of every facet of the productionNot only was he often the sole person who knew what the end product was to be as in The Kid but he was also allowed to elaborately improvise in the creative process  This often meant doing countless scores of retakes over days weeks and even months; holding up the cast and crew for days while he brooded over just what to do next; and even in the case of The Gold Rush cancelling expensive weeks of location shooting and returning to the studio to start all over againHe cleverly duped chief studio and bank chiefs into somehow going along with his freewheeling and gross inclinations thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hitandmiss schemes and trialanderror madnessIn other words Chaplin used the entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush with which he toyed at his pleasure to create his personal canvases  Fortunately he was a genius and at the right place in time to be allowed to get away with such unprecedented extravagenceIt was a young and growing industry when Chaplin began emerging and there were no set rules  People were still trying to figure out just what could be done with the medium  and Chaplin helped to establish its early parametersHe was certainly and autocrat yet that doesnt really matter when it comes to film works  Its the product that counts  In the case of City Lights all the bloodsweatandtears that it took to achieve the finished product was more than worth the effort  Now that all the frustration anger and outrage associated with the behindthescenes unfoldment of this highly troubled production are well in the past what remains is a genuinely moving film classic,10
634,tt0021749,The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one The first fulllength talkies were released in  By  theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business By  silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism But in  a new silent picture was released that far from being an embarrassing failure became the fourthhighest grossing picture of the year being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy The picture was City Lights and its producer writer director editor composer and star was Mr Charlie ChaplinChaplin was of course primarily a comedian and his humour was of broad appeal but audiences of the time were not exactly starved of easy comedy The Marx Brothers were making great strides on the verbal quipping front and the everpopular Laurel and Hardy had made a successful transition to sound What makes Charlie stand out and what gave him a level of accessibility that allowed him to continue with his slapstick antics well into the sound era is his equal devotion to story which allowed him a scope for social commentary empathetic characterisation and deep poignancy Of all Chaplins silent pictures City Lights is probably his least memorable in the funny stakes The number of classic gags here is fairly small Not since The Kid a decade earlier has Chaplin given story so much precedence City Lights is riddled with coincidence and plot contrivance but its a tale of such beauty and sincerity that this does not matter Within this story the comedy becomes functional often serving to puncture a schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone Ironically it is the occasional forays into slapstick that help keep City Lights realAs if to snub the talkie City Lights is a remarkable achievement in complex visual narrative even only occasionally relying upon title cards and then often only as an embellishment to the more comedydriven moments Most plot points and character traits are implied rather than stated which gives the picture a continual smoothness – another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad to see the back of the intrusive title card Out of necessity Chaplins technical approach is more overt than his usual He often cuts to a closeup to give us a necessary reaction and there are even some whippans in the scene where he and the flower girl first meet but all of this is in keeping with the rhythm and tone of the picture Those whip pans after all reflect an abrupt emotional moment and are in no way a blatant or showy manoeuvreBut what really makes City Lights work what makes it connect is the man himself on the screen Those additional closeups once a rarity for a man who acted mainly with his body now show off a capability for intense facial acting An older more meditative Chaplin may have been keeping the traditions of silent cinema alive but his own career trajectory was entering new ground where emotional expression was increasingly intimate and personal The result is profoundly moving,10
635,tt0021749,City Lights is a different film from what I am used to seeing I have not watched a Silent film or pantomime in a few years I really enjoyed the story that Charles Chaplin helped to create and produce for our enjoyment The plot seems to be commonly used now with a boy falling in love and trying to win the girls love in return In City Lights there are a few twists to the plot The girl is blind and poor the TrampChaplinis poor in love and wants to help the blind girl The Millionaire can help the tramp out by giving him money but he is an onagain offagain friend depending on whether or not he is drunkBeing that this is a silent film there is more importance on the use of props and the acting of the character Since in a silent film they cant tell us how they are feeling it is important that we can understand feelings through action This may be through facial expressions body language dress eye contact kinds of touch or the use of written statements like title cards in a silent film A prop that stood out to me was the use of flowers From the flower girl selling her flowers to how Chaplin was always holding or smelling one of the flowers from his special girl the use of flowers helped show the emotions and feelings of the two characters It symbolized the affection he had for her because like the flowers she couldnt see she couldnt see the true him or his true affections Another prop that was used was money From the millionaires point of view money was really of no matter He threw a party just because he had been reunited with his friend he went out to the dance club and when Chaplin needed money in order to help the flower girl pay for rent and surgery he was willing to give him one thousand dollars To the millionaire this money is nothing but to Chaplin and the flower girl this is a showing forth of love and charity When the movie was made in the s many people were poor and hopeless but the portrayal of Chaplin as a poor but happy and hopeful man might have given hope to others who watched this movie during the Depression In the film I noticed the use of a repetition or rather a parallelism as was read in the Film Art book dealing with The Wizard of Oz They show shots one way in Kansas and then reverse the shot in Oz as I saw in City Lights In City Lights parallelism is done with sight not necessarily with eyes but with the mind We see the reverse where the poor blind girl sees Chaplin as a millionaire and then at the end she sees him as the tramp he is with her new eyesight The true reverse is emphasized because she is now working in a shop and making money The two characters are somehow always at perceived opposite ends of the social class spectrum yet he still has a desire for her to be happy because of his love Another reverse is the happy friendly drunk millionaire who sees Chaplin as his friend and hero for stopping him from committing suicide However when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him throws him out and even has him arrestedIn a way this film is different then what our generation might be used to but by watching these classics we can better learn where the movies we love today came from and gain a better appreciation for the art of film,7
636,tt0021749,The tramp tries to nurture and help a blind flower girl regain sight despite scant resources and the prejudices and graft of the big city Although the physical gags lack the largescale invention of the factory scenes in Modern Times and the criticism of the wealthy doesnt transcend an admittedly witty recurring jokethe aristocrat friend can only demonstrate compassion and friendliness in an inebriated state; hes always inviting the tramp in only to incredulously throw him out the next sober morningthe tramps touching earnestness in rescuing his angel from a life of abjection is simple and selfless and deeply moving I would say it also fades out at the perfect moment of openended ambiguitythe viewer is forced to make resonant meaning out of the final troublingly cathartic shot even as the film articulates a consistent worldview in relation to what has come before In my eyes Modern Times is Chaplins masterpiece but City Lights would probably better merit repeat viewings which is as much a testament to the films power as anything else,8
637,tt0021749,City Lights is probably one of the most well loved along with Modern Times Chaplin movies The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp one of the most lovable truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps like they are labeled lazy and troublesome It is very hard to hate The Tramp because he gives so much when he has so little He spends his time and money giving to people  whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl Undoubtedly we all have a little bit of The Tramp in usThe plot is as follows the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street She is poor and by a mere coincidence believes that The Tramp is rich He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide and despite his gratefulness doesnt remember the poor tramp unless he is drunkCity Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history Its poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy I believe it is a strong mixture of both and a great balance of the two Both comedic and touching City Lights should not be missed by anyone,8
638,tt0021749, its perhaps a test of a persons outlook to ask them what they see in the final scene If theyve never seen City Lights before and they instantly notice the major continuity issue Chaplin holds a flower to his lapel from the rear shot its up to his mouth on his close up then maybe theyve placed film studies over romanceIt took a few viewings before I spotted this and once I did I cant help but notice it Yet even despite this I never fail to get choked up on the beauty of that final scene If you want to impress the right kind of girl put it on and show her what a sensitive soul you are during those final momentsAs for the rest of the film then while the final five minutes are classic and perhaps the best thing Chaplin ever did the rest of it is episodic and patchy necessitating my relatively low score Still a fine film but never a completely great one what presages those beautiful final moments is merely fine entertainment,7
639,tt0021749,If i have to choose which movie have the best ending it is very easy to choose city lights it is very very easy Chaplin was genius seriously genius This is the movie that truly inspire me After i watch city lights i just know there is such a movie power that exist in this world that can move and touch me really deep I never feel such a sharp sensation ever from any hundred movies i watch before and this movie pierce me through the heart within silent only gesture eye contact and cameraworks with no dialoguesometimes i try to analyze deeply why this movie have such a magnificent power i think the reason is the connection between scenes if we ask ourself what makes a good ending ? maybe the answer is how good you make the scene before the ending how good you correlate the prologue and epilogue and also between them how you fill the midduration of a movie if the director took a right decision a movie will not have any wasted scenes its only genius filmmaker can do and chaplin is one of themsilent movie such as city light is a hardkind of movie to made it needs next level of acting skill from the actors and actresses because there are no dialogue in it and most of the duration this movie is flawless in casting and the ending scene were unbelievable and unpredictable maximum genuine artbeauty of silent moviei recommend everybody to watch this movie at least once this movie is special it definitely will pierce you,10
640,tt0021749,As always the little tramp is fleeing the long arm of the law when he is mistaken for a wealthy man by a blind girl selling flowers by the roadside While he longs to help her the tramp knows he cannot However when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon a drunken man who he helps out who may be able to help him in turn  if the two of them can sober up long enoughIn response to seeing some modern trash posing as comedies recently Little Man Norbit Pluto Nash  Im looking at you I decided to check out some comedies that have stood the test of time  a few Chaplin films being among them City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start As was often the case this film has a thin narrative but one that allows for several scenarios for Chaplin to work his magic And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole filmThe statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at His support do no more than that  support him  but yet they are also roundly good Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character while Myers Garcia Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside ChaplinCity Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent setpieces that tickle and also stick in the mind So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead,0

642,tt0021749,Four years into sound Charlie Chaplin wrote performed directed and scored one of films finest masterpiecesThe story is about the Little Tramp befriending a blind woman who mistakenly thinks he is rich Along the way he manages to get into a series of unintentional fixes with a large cast of foils at his disposal as he struggles to finance an operation for the womanIn an incredible display of comic talent Chaplin bombards the audience with scene after scene of magnificently choreographed comedy Drunk dancing or boxing his graceful slapstick is a rare combination of comedy and beauty a comic ballet Chaplins performing artistry as well as his ideas reach their apex with City Lights where only Chaplin would dare to challenge the naturally progressive trend and technological status quo by daring to make a silent By pulling it off with aplomb he solidified his place atop the history of the profession Some sound is used sparingly brilliantly with a statue dedication and a piano keyboard but no intelligible words are uttered The track and Chaplins score is lyrical energized and integral The film is perfectly constructedIn the masterful hands of Chaplin he avoids bathos in his scenes with the blind woman by severing the sentimentality and the scene with a comic moment saving it all for the incredibly touching and moving finale Up until then it is a display of comic genius that only a handful of others might lay claim to,10
643,tt0021749,As much as I loved The Kid The Gold Rush Modern Times and The Great Dictator City Lights is the film I consider Charlie Chaplins masterpiece And there are several reasons why this is so for meI love how City Lights is filmed once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets The music is also a delightthough my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times with plenty of themes that stuck in my head while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand The comedy is brilliantly done the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin moviealong with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator but ever in a comedy while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girlplayed touchingly by Virginia Cherrill he falls in love with And I also found the closeup climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity Chaplin is superb his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with CherrillOverall yet another Chaplin masterpiece yet for me this is the best of them all / Bethany Cox,10
644,tt0021749,Charlie Chaplin made some extremely funny shorts but of his longer films this is one of the best along with The Gold Rush and Modern Times Two stories are woven together One is Charlies onagain offagain friendship with a wealthy drunk The guy has a case of multiple personality When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts When hes sober he doesnt recognize Charlie at allThe second story involves a pretty blind flower girl who given certain distances angles and lighting resembles Uma Thurman Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballsCharlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy hes sober and wont support Charlies story Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel broke and bitter he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands The happy endingTheres sentimentality in the story of course There often is in Chaplins later films But as usual its somehow tempered Here its undercut by ironyWhen Charlie meets the wealthy toff the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope Hes about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes gives him a pep talk and changes his mind His spirit revived the rich guy spread his arms to the sky dropping the boulder that falls on Charlies footAnd when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl shes enthralled by his gentleness Unseen by her the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain himself enraptured Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlies face Well its not the blind Mr Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W C Fields general store but what is? A note There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film not counting the DempseyTunney debacle but I dont think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed hereIts hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this Black and white and silent Applause please,8
645,tt0021749,City Lights  **** out of Charlie Chaplin returns as The Tramp and this time he falls in love with a blind girl Virginia Cherrill and sets out to help her The Tramp eventually meets a suicidal drunk Harry Myers and their friendship leads to what might eventually help the girl he lovesChaplin made great films before and after CITY LIGHTS but for my money this here is his greatest film as well as one of the greatest films ever made Not only is it one of the funniest movies ever made but Id also argue that its one of the greatest love stories if not the greatest It really says a lot when a movie can conqueror two genres at one time but CITY LIGHTS is simply one of the greatest movies ever madeI think it says a lot that you get one classic scene after another and theres really not a weak spot to be found here Being  it took some real guts for Chaplin to deliver a silent film and I think he knew that he had to deliver something special because people had moved onto sound He certainly delivered something special as this here was easily the funniest film he had made up to this point The opening sequence with the introduction of The Tramp was priceless and we got one hilarious scene after another from that point The scenes with the drunk are downright hilarious as is another scene where The Tramp is trying to eat but without much success The cigar sequence is a masterpiece as is the by the water In fact the story between The Tramp and the drunk would have made a terrific movie on its own Just like the stuff with The Tramp and the blind girl would have made a perfect film Whats so special is that you get both stories wrapped up in one and it really deliversChaplin played The Tramp countless times but he was never better than he is here Just check out the timing in countless scenes including the boxing match and you cant help but be impressed with the actor Myers also deserves a lot of credit as the drunk as his timing has to match that of Chaplin throughout and the two men do a wonderful job together Then youve got Cherrill who wasnt a professional actor but the director makes her shine throughoutCITY LIGHTS contains one great scene after another and all of the laughs lead up to one of the most powerful endings in film history Theres really not enough great things that can be said about this film as it continues to get better with each passing year,0
646,tt0022100,Fritz Langs highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement and ended in the United States in  with the production of The Big Heat a film noir classic Perhaps his greatest film M Germany  forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones Even though M was Langs and Germanys first sound film many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late s While most early talkies return films to their static visually monotonous stage imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium M avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous offscreen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue The films editing particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling Of course many of the films sound effects are also imaginative and memorable none more so than the compulsive whistling of the films central character the stalker and serial killer of little girls Hans Beckert magnificently played by Peter Lorre Sound is also an important contributor to Ms rich and influential use of off screen space One famous example is the scene that introduces Beckert as a shadow against his own Wanted poster creepily intoning to his next victim Elsie Beckmann You have a very pretty ball Not only is Beckerts shadow a bow toward Langs expressionist artistic roots but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image  that is among us the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuousappearing albeit monstrous member Another example of Langs use of offscreen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is Elsies absence from them an empty chair at the Beckmann dinner table the vertiginous stairwell down which Elsies mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughters arrival the attic play area that awaits Elsies return from school Most memorable of all  and most often alluded to visually in other films  is the series of shots that indirectly record Beckerts assault and murder of the innocent child representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of Elsies ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame Never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated imagesBeyond its technical brilliance the keys to Ms lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of Hans Beckerts twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and trial Unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer Beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath Nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clearcut To be sure the gutreaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry capture Beckert and bring him to a mock formal trial whose conclusion is foregone Like many in America today Beckerts accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the monster in the surest way possible a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible Considering the heinousness of Beckerts crimes and the imperfections of a legal/medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again this emotional response is hard to resist Yet M is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism  quite the contrary Through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of Beckerts unkempt court appointed defense attorney and Beckerts own impassioned monologue Lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others guilty or not in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding Nazism in s Germany That the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks dresses and gestures like a Gestapo officer is no accident Moreover the letter M chalked on Beckerts back by one of his pursuers not only stands for murderer but also alludes to Gods marking of Cain While the popular misconception holds that the mark of Cain symbolizes his evil it in fact represents Gods warning to Cains flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance but to leave justice in Gods hands Translated into secular terms and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame Gods hands in M belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try Hans Beckert in the name of the Law,10

648,tt0022100,M is a monumental film and seriously should be watched by all For a film like this to be made in  is just shocking Even if the film was released today it would still be nothing like we have seen before In our modern age of film making there has been a considerable rise in the production of films about serial killers their complexities and particularly about pathological ones Yet M is the first movie that comes to my mind when I think of the themes that have been in Psycho Silence of the Lambs Seven and not to mention countless moreThe film is lead by Peter Lorre in a transcending performance who plays the serial killer and rapist in which the film is centered around In this performance Lorre is successful in something that at the very least is rare to see in any kind of film compassion for a child killer and rapist Lorre makes the viewer see that he is not a criminal by choice but by a sickness of compulsion Too often then not is our perception of a psychotic killer having that look that puts fear into his or hers victims eyes Lorre doesnt do that but rather displays a frightened man a scared man One in which his desperation leads to his hazardous behavior His portrayal of a killer is not of a fearless one but of one consumed by fear Something that even today we as a people cannot understand let alone in The direction and writing of Fritz Lang is beyond comprehensible as he taps into the mind of a serial killer and his complexities He does so in such that we get an empathetic and compassionate illustration of all sides of the story This in which by then end of the film all points of view are more then well delivered to the audience Fritz Lang here has simply created here a timeless masterpiece One that excels in its technical aspects and enlightens the audience on a topic that other films still have not yet to match M inI highly recommend this film for many obvious reasons and conclusions This film was created by one of the all time great directors in Fritz Lang Langs command for the screen is mesmerizing and a joy to witness and so on and so forth Yet much of this is mostly superficial and a waste of time to continuously state M as I mentioned before takes a strong and original stance on an issue that we as a society yet have not fully resolved This film may not give you THE answer on this issue but it may sway that moral compass of yours that lies inside of all of us,10
649,tt0022100,The economy austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound and precise filmmakers Lang a master of the German expressionist film shot his first talkie a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies It was a shocking idea for its time based on the reallife killer Peter Kurten headlined as the Vampire of DüsseldorfM is about a terrorized city and a plump little man with wide eyes often chewing candy who is a pathological childkiller unable to control his urge for killing The film embodies several Lang themes the duality between justice and revenge mob hysteria the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in and for probably the first time in the cinema it adds a new dimension to suspense pity For the killer is clearly mentally sick He cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease and yet we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal rather than treated as a sick man Early in the film the killer is heard whistling the Grieg theme from In the Hall of the Mountain King This theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace And when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window the melody on the soundtrack told us chillingly that the murderer is there just out of sightThe Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since Casablanca The Maltese Falcon and The Mask of Dimitrios When the photographs of his victims all little girls are shown to him he jumps back and twitches with horrorWith powerful visuals Langs motion picture is Lorres first film His performance as the corpulent hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion Lorre is the archetypal outsideroutside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal He had only twelve lines of dialogIn the most famous of all about a pathological killer  Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho  Anthony Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy Psycho reeked with blood and horror whereas the suspense of M is subtle A childs balloon without an owner a rolling ball are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed The audience trapped in its seats torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight,8
650,tt0022100,The first time I saw M by Fritz Lang I almost didnt know what to make of it I was overwhelmed by the power of the performances the staging of the scenes the locations and the power that the simple story had with such complex circumstances Then I saw it again and a third time and I know that this is one of the best films ever to come out of Germany its a powerful statement about protecting our children if youre looking at it as a message movie but in reality it is just a piece of cinema heaven Thrillers today only wish they could draw a viewer into the mystery elements and have such unconventionality of the times Boiling down to this M is about a child Killer  the legendary character actor Peter Lorre in his first major role  who snatches children when their parents dont watch and continues on until an investigation goes underway But as the police investigate overly thoroughly into the real criminal underworld they know something is up that this is someone far more gone than they could ever be so they join in the hunt This all leads to one of the supreme dramatic climaxes in any thrillerOn the first viewing I just went straight for the story which is able to suck one in enough to make you feel dizzy But on the multiple viewings it becomes even more interesting as one can study the intricacy and indeed fullon artistry of Langs camera He puts it in unusual places at times and adds for good measure shades of dark and gray in many of the night scene this is by the way a precursor to filmnoir which Lang later became an important director in the s and s On top of this there is a very modern sense of style in the editing I remember a couple of scenes that surprised me editing wise One is where the cops I think it was the cops have an argument about the investigation two of them get into a shouting match and we get medium closeups of them going back and forth This is done quickly with a kind of intensity that isnt even captured in todays thrillers There is also the hunt for Lorre in the digging of the house where Lang cuts around constantly heightening the tension between the predators the criminals and the prey Lorre until its almost too much to takeThe disturbing aspects of the story of child abduction and murder have become benchmarks of a number of todays thrillers where the cop is usually the subject and the killer left more in the shadows in cat &amp; mouse style This doesnt happen here and because of it by the time we get to the final scene with Lorre being interrogated and giving his I cant help it speech it becomes something poetic tragic frightening Lang doesnt leave his message so simplistically he makes sure we know Lorres side too however twisted it has become and the antagonist is shown as human as opposed to these presentday thriller where the killers are barely given one dimension let alone two There were reports that during filming Lang put Lorre through torture ultimately causing the two to never work together again But nevertheless out of this comes a towering performance of a small wildeyed criminal in the midst of an extremely welltold and unpredictable mystery story In short if you dont know what youre in for when you hear that whistle those several infamous notes you may not at all,10
651,tt0022100,The opening scene of this movie is the first clue to its near perfection  A mother preparing dinner for her child waiting anxiously for her to return from school  Her hope and then distress as she hears people pass outside her door  While down in the streets of Berlin her daughter is receiving a balloon from a strange man in a long black coat  We know whats going to happen but its still horrific to watchFritz Lang you cinematic god!  A simple story of the underworld the police and a single man holding an entire city hostage and done with such precision and prenoir darkness that is oozes creepy suspense from beginning to endBut this movie is not so simple as the police inspectors trying to catch a devious murderer  its about the mob employing its network of beggars and petty thieves also trying to bring the killer to their own brand of justice Apparently the police crackdown caused by the murders is bad for business  so the mob begins to track him down as wellIts not only a great crime story and perhaps the first physiological thriller the murderer is schizophrenic but theres comments to be made here about the nature of justice and who should best dispense itIn all not only a trailblazing classic but THE trailblazing classic,10
652,tt0022100,This is a very interesting film on so many levels Its interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture  Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place  what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding Compare it with any American film from  and you cant help but see the differenceThe murderer artfully played by Peter Lorre has been killing children that have no link to him personally for months The police despite all of their efforts are unable to catch him mainly because there is no rhyme or reason in his choice of victims At first there is a focus on the victims and the hole left in their families by their killing Then the film shifts to two normally opposed groups  the police and the underworld After several months of no results by the authorities the police are unhappy because it reflects badly upon them and the underworld is unhappy because their activities are being disrupted because of the police doing constant raids in their efforts to capture the killerIn a particularly welldone part of the film the scene shifts back and forth between a conference of police and one of the underworld They discuss how they are going to catch the killer The police settle upon the idea of looking for people with a history of past mental problems that were pronounced cured and released The underworld decides to enlist an invisible group  the beggars  to follow every child at all times and therefore catch the killer Both groups focus on the right suspect the question is  who gets there first? M is a fascinating film that raises many topics  the death penalty a group of criminals that are criminals by choice causing less stress on society than a lone criminal that acts out of an uncontrollable compulsion and the motivations of the authorities often being their own bureaucratic survival rather than the larger issue of ending a series of horrible acts against humanity,9
653,tt0022100,Being a huge fan of German Expressionist art Im naturally drawn to the films of Fritz Lang  I recently was able to see the restored version of Metropolis on the big screen and was delighted to see M on the Sundance channel  especially since it was the uncut version  M follows the trail of a child killer Peter Lorre sought both by the police and the members of the underworld whose businesses are being effected by the investigation ,8
654,tt0022100,This movie is definitely one of the scariest movies Ive ever seen Its about this childlike pity evoking man brilliantly played by Peter Lorre who also happens to be a psychotic child killer The city in which he lives is of course panicked by the mysterious childkillings and both the criminals and the police starts to haunt the man down I wont reveal more then this but I will say this Just because its an old movie dont let your guard down This movie is one of those rare movies which are so good that youll never forget them,10
655,tt0022100,In an eerie propagandist fashion the phrase in the name of the Law is repeated over the last two scenes of Fritz Langs M as a child killer is brought to justice If L represents the State and the Law then M is meant to represent the Individual who in this case is a Murderer Lang boldly asked us way back in  whose rights come first the State or the Individual? A master of his craft Lang leaves the question openended and lets the audience decideM is shockingly contemporary in its psychological complexities It explores the psychology of individualism vs group think while showcasing how a state of fear can be inflicted upon a populace when a government fails to protect society from a single individual terrorizing the people The story is fairly straightforward An elusive citizen begins killing innocent children in a large nameless German city The media fuels a paranoid frenzy that incites the public The clueless police begin to raid the underworld after the populace is turned into a raving mob because of the failure to capture the killer The underworld comes to a screeching halt as their business is ruined by the police and starts their own manhunt for the killerUnlike a modern period piece that attempts to evoke a certain place and time M WAS a certain place and time Lang in an almost prophetic sense captured the state of mind of the German people in  as the Weimar Republic was on the brink of collapse and the Nazi Regime was preparing to take over When individuals live in a state of fear as they do in M society collapses and the Individual is crushed Only the State it seems can bring orderM is a also a masterpiece for its technical aspects The way in which Lang uses his camera to move through windows capture shadows reflections empty spaces and shift pointsofview is staggering even by todays standards He also played with the new technology of recorded sound with extensive voiceover narration and dialogue used to overlap and transition between scenes Didnt critics recently praise Michael Clayton for utilizing just such a technique as if it was something revolutionary? One can also see a protean style the would eventually birth the Film Noir movement with the creation of tension and suspense in the use of shadows and camera anglesYet M is not perfect It has some major flaws There are no real characters in the film to speak of in the modern sense The film is virtually all built around mood and plot The only time Lang invites us to emotionally connect is in the opening and closing scenes with a mother of one of the victims and in the classic scene of Peter Lorre giving his writhing and primal I cant help it! speech in front of the kangaroo court of criminals The mothers grief and Lorres madness are presented so sparsely and in such a raw form that it becomes too painful to want to connect with them Another flaw that is often overstated about films from this time period is the slow pace of the early police procedural scenes These inherent flaws combined with the inherent brilliance of Langs vision make M one of the most challenging films a modern viewer could ever sit throughWhat impressed me most about M was the subtlety of the symbolism Lang created with his haunting images As harrowing as the story is none of the gruesomeness is shown on screen Its all transmitted to the viewer through the power of suggestion Is it any wonder Hitler wanted Fritz Lang for his propaganda machine which thankfully led to Lang fleeing to America? Ill never forget the wide shots of the kangaroo court and the looks on those peoples faces as the killer is brought down the steps for trial or the vast expanse of that empty warehouse The scene of the ball rolling in the grass with no one to catch it the balloon caught in the telephone wires and the empty domestic spaces the mother has to inhabit after her child has been murdered are the types of scenes that tape into Jungian archetypes and shared fears The look on Lorres face as he confesses the hand of the Law coming down to save Lorre from being lynched and the ghastly plea from the mother in the final scene will stick with me for the rest of my life M is a communal nightmare; one that from which we have yet to awake,10
656,tt0022100,This is one of those movies that will stay with you for the rest of your life  The characters are ugly and disturbing there is nothing cute in this movieThere are constant parallelisms drawn between the police and the underworld and the common way in which they operateWe also get to journey into the mind of the madman  If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs you should see this alsoOf course you must be patient enough to deal with subtitles and the fact that this is a very old movie  one of the first talkies  But most viewers will get something out of the dialogue even without knowing the German language,10
657,tt0022100,Great story with incredible development of ideas and feelings while giving the audience an indepth perspective for each side to an extremely difficult issue to resolve  Every film lover should take the time to see this film for its ingenious style and execution of ideas  Adds a little comedy in interesting ways to help entertain and engage the audience  Acting is incredibly real and heart felt  Dramatic and tender to fit to any interest,0
658,tt0022100,This movie is so intense and enthralling it doesnt have to hide from even the most amazing Actionmovies But unlike the most actionmovies it really has a story to tell with a very interesting conclusion at the endWhen people talk about Fritz Lang they always talk about Metropolis but I think this is his masterpiece This movie MUST HAVE inspired pretty much every police movie or show ever made Rarely have I rated a movie a  with more confidence than this oneEND OF REVIEW so I dont have anymore lines but they make me write  lines apparently so Im writing this I know a joke ehm well its not a good one so I will quote GEORGE BESTI spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars The rest I just squandered,10
659,tt0022100,Watching Fritz Langs M is watching the history of cinema unfold before ones eyes Made in the transition period between the silent and sound film this  masterpiece remains fascinating for several reasonsFirst of all the use of sound is impeccable Suffice to say the killer in the movie is caught is through identifying his trademark whistling But the use of voiceover narration was also new at the time and is used here very well first when a mother calls in panic for her missing child and her name echoes across several empty walls Next in a scene in which two detectives elaborate on what theyve done to apprehend the killer and everything they say is matched by an imageSecondly few times has a serial killer been treated with such complexity compassion and straightforwardness in cinema Peter Lorre plays a child murder a man who acts by impulse possibly a schizophrenic He simultaneously evokes horror and pity and hes too distant from the supercool and erudite serial killers of today Lorre plays one Hans Beckert a lonely man with a history of mental illness an ordinary man without any qualities or amazing traitsThirdly its a powerful meditation on vigilantism and crime The police is unable to capture the killer so Berlins underground decides to capture the criminal The police raids are putting them out of business and they resent the fact that a child killer is being sought amidst their ranks The absurdity of bank robbers and card cheaters with a sense of morals is not lost on the filmmakers In a mocktrial at the end these same criminals think they have the authority to sentence the child murder to death But as he tells them if they wanted if they got jobs and worked honestly they could leave their lives of crime; a man whos ordered by voices to kill cant just turn off him impulsesBut above all M is a fascinating exciting thriller Its an intelligent crime story that shows police and criminals working on different sides and with different means to achieve the same purpose If one can laugh at the idea of a criminal union realism should never be a criterion for judging art one cant laugh at the policemen in this movie Inspector Lohmann played by Otto Wernicke is one of most intelligent detectives ever to grace cinema Hes fat hes cranky hes an unlikely hero but hes shrewd he can read a persons personality at a glance hes patient Lang must have liked him too because he used the character and actor in his following crime epic The Testament of Dr Mabuse in which Lohmann shows even greater skillsI knew or at least highly expected that M would be an amazing movie But I didnt imagine a yearold movie would hold up so well in terms of cinematography sound pacing acting structure Few movies achieve such a synthesis of qualities There is no doubt on my mind that M deserves the recognition it continues to receive from film historians,10
660,tt0022100,In my opinion this is just an OK film Except for some little stylistic tricks there is nothing special The story is OK how it is told is rather weak in some parts its even ridiculous the acting is mostly very weak except for Lorre who you dont see much of anyway and the sound quality is horrible something you cant blame it for but I had to use HEADPHONES on full volume to even understand the words! but switching from sound to silent all the time is very distracting and has no dramatic effect at all even if some say so  the opposite is the case it seems very amateurish The slow pacing is typical for its time And suspense? I dont think so In my opinion the main reasons why this film is so critically acclaimed areA Lorres overacting Whenever overacting has a purpose its critically acclaimed And his acting as a madman is very effective B Id call it heavy look The topic seems heavy and the plot and style seem all too heavy and important You almost want the film to be successful so you search for it in Lorres acting As a justification so to say Im sure you like the film for many other reasons too Some more important reasons maybe But that doesnt mean Im wrong Its a film we want to like and where you dont want to look for the flaws Well long story short I dont think the final result is a success There is too much Average in it and the Great isnt all that great Metropolis Nosferatu Caligari Sunrise I think have all a more stunning look All silent and all made before M Dont get me wrong the cinematography is good and also inventive in little parts but not THAT revolutionary that it deserves the reputation it has Probably the flaws are too big for me to fully appreciate the rest Like every time one said He doesnt leave any marksblah blah I had to laugh He talks with the kids in the middle of the day in the middle of the street he walks along the streets with them he goes into shops buys stuff for them he makes mad gestures in public And then he also whistles this damn song all the time so loud you hear it from three streets away while everyone in the audience knows from beginning on that this will be his doom /,6
661,tt0022100,While many of the problems of early sound pictures lampooned in Singin in the Rain were more or less myths the early talkies did present a big challenge for filmmakers everywhere Europe however was at an advantage over Hollywood because even though it took them a few years to gain the same access to sound technology films from the US would be screened abroad only six months or so after their first domestic release Thus directors like Fritz Lang were able to witness Hollywoods first faltering steps with sound before giving it a go themselvesIts funny how sceptics dismissed sound as a gimmick because the best early uses of sound were those that treated it as exactly that – a gimmick Lang demonstrates in M that a talkie need not be an entirely new kind of motion picture; sound is merely another layer of technique Rather than getting bogged down in lengthy dialogue scenes Lang keeps his storytelling primarily visual and when he needs lots of expository dialogue he intercuts multiple scenes to keep the pace going This is not to say Lang is trying to ignore sound – in fact he uses it to enhance the picture sometimes having dialogue or other noises take place offscreen to focus us on reactions or causeandeffect Other times he ironically uses completely silence something of course you never get with silent pictures due to the continuous musical score giving a dreadful sense of eerinessAnd thankfully the best elements of Langs method have survived the talkie revolution His visual style is particularly effective here in provoking a chilling disturbing atmosphere Shot compositions with large blank areas give a sense of surreal starkness Characters often stare intensely straight at the camera aggressively drawing the audience into the films world Several times we are even dumped straight into the pointofview of the killer himself The fragmented narrative with its lack of lead characters and impersonal pointbypoint plotting could easily be boring but Lang holds our interest by keeping a dynamic sense of rhythm and telling the bulk of the tale through pure wordless imagery Langs German pictures in common with typical German cinema of the time feature highly melodramatic acting and exaggerated almost comical characters These figures generally suited the fantasies and comicbook stories of Langs silent days but Im not sure they sit so well with the closetohome setting of M Still these characters are somewhat more effective now that they have voices probably because most German screen actors of the day were from a stage background Peter Lorre was a shameless ham but thats what you need to play a psychopath and in any case hes a lot better here than in many of his Hollywood roles Otto Wernicke is also incredibly entertaining in the role of Inspector Karl Fatty Lohmann; again a stagy exaggeration but with some absolutely wonderful gestures and comic timingThere isnt a lot else I can say about M – it is one of those pictures that has been analysed to death – although I doubt any comment other than mine mentions Singin in the Rain in the opening line  While not quite Langs best picture I can think of few directors who made such a smooth transition from silents to talkies and sadly this was his penultimate German picture before the Nazis took over Theres no denying that Lang was wasted in Hollywood He did his best to understand it but by and large it never understood him I say by and large; the renowned Irving Thalberg was reportedly bowled over by M and screened it to many of his writers and directors as inspirational material Had that prestigious and influential producer not died in  the same year Lang began working in Hollywood would things have turned out differently I wonder?,9
662,tt0022100,Masterpiece is the word most film buffs and historians probably would use to describe this  Fritz Lange film based loosely on the events of a reallife serial killer a few years prior to the film In this movie the killer is Hans Beckert Peter Lorre who lures children to their deathsThough the story is about a child killer the theme of M centers more on societys obsession with the murders From kids playing games to adults going about their everyday lives everyone is on guard suspicious combative and very vindictive For selfish reasons even the petty criminal underworld wants the child killer caught But the police are ineffective and a selfrighteous mob mentality takes over The whole film is really a study in the terrifying psychology of group thinkAs it turns out the killer is less monstrous than pathetic and compulsive Beckert cant help himself Hes a short squatty bugeyed little man who cant control the devil within Lorre was perfect for the role and his acting is flawless and mesmerizing Yes the killings all offscreen are awful But the militant lynchmob mentality is just as scary Beckert is the only individualist in the filmPart silent film and part talkie the B&amp;W visual style of M is wonderfully expressionistic and baroque There are lots of overhead camera shots Background sounds like honking horns and whistles are precursors of major plot pointsWhat strikes me most about this film is its tone I can think of very few films that are so harsh so bitter so malicious so punitive M contains not an ounce of humanism Langs exwife Thea von Harbou a Nazi sympathizer wrote the film just before the rise of Hitler The films angry militant tone thus foreshadows Hitlers Third Reich from  until  Lang himself fled Germany and ended up in the USYour own personal preferences in films will determine whether you consider M to be a masterpiece or overrated or perhaps somewhere in between But individual preferences aside there can be no doubt that M is an important film historically Every person who wishes to be versed in classic films needs to see M at least once,0
663,tt0022100,A serial killer who favors children Peter Lorre is on the loose in Berlin He is wanted by the police But even worse for him he is wanted by the Berlin underworld who have been targeted falsely by the police for being involved Watch out child killer! There is nothing bad I can say about this film The acting the directing the sound all perfect Many have praised Lang for his use of sound at a time when the practice was just coming into play And rightfully so Whereas other films have sound matching what is on the screen Lang realized he could use the effect to signify what he was not showing including the murderer who has a distinctive whistle Brilliant Not to mention that one key role is a blind beggar a man who cannot appreciate visuals but only sounds he is appropriately the man who can identify the killer! Basing the story loosely off of childmurderers of the day Grossman Haarman and Peter Kürten this is one of the darkest tales set to film up to this point There is no blood and no children are actually seen killed And the killer is relatively reserved compared to his reallife counterparts who were also rapists and cannibals He presents an interesting defense his crimes are less wrong than the crimes of others because he cannot psychologically control himself Or in modern terms not guilty by reason of mental defect Is a child killer less evil than a pickpocket? Is he in some way also a victim?I enjoyed the idea of a unionized underworld I do not know the reality of this as it seemed sort of comic and anticipated such villainous teamups as we might see in comic books But crime was certainly not unheard of and even black market meat existed and I am not sure if I really want to know what that meansMany including reviewer Stanley Kauffmann have noticed the similarity between M and Bertolt Brechts Threepenny Opera Sadly I have not seen Brechts work and cannot comment on the comparison German philosopher Theodor Lessing best known for his work on Jewish selfhatred may even have been an inspiration due to his work on Haarmann But regardless of inspiration Lang is the master here his work stands the test of time and today almost a century later is widely recognized as one of the greatest achievements on film At the least many consider it the alltime greatest German film And rightfully soThere are so many great shots including the socalled inventory shot of the criminal underworlds wares Lang also excelled with the camera angles using knives as frames and getting more than one great mirror shot I should also give credit to cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner who previously worked on Nosferatu and many others  his reputation should be second only to Karl FreundThere is nothing that beats the Criterion release with commentary short films and more I watched the film this way on DVD Perhaps a Bluray release has even more but I would not even know what could be added This disc is packed and a mustown for any film historian or Lang fan,10
664,tt0022100,Outstanding German expressionist film from Fritz Lang that follows first the police then the underworld as they search for a child killer in Berlin The cinematography is moody and dramatic as the story moves through the poorer sections of the great city and the acting while of a more melodramatic style than is currently popular is very good* Peter Lorre is outstanding as the killer who taunts the police as the noose slowly tightens around him To some extent the film is an early procedural drama as the police use then modern forensic techniques such as finger printing and graphology to try and find the killer Tired of the increased police surveillance the citys criminal element begins their own search mobilising the numerous beggars to be eyes on the street The film touches on a number of issues that are as relevant now as in the s including mob mentality men are accused of being the killer simply for talking to a child rights of the accused the end justifies the means use of torture and the ever thorny issue of mental health and culpability One of the great preWWII German films *I watched a subtitled version on TCM,10
665,tt0022100,M like Manichean?

Fritz Lang personal Jaccuse against a system where accusers arent all innocentM like Maturity? The film also consecrates German Expressionism as a peak of creativity and social relevance a sequence in history where Berlin became literally the best area and arena of expression to an art that had reached its maturityOr M like Mörder murderer in German Maudit in French doomed and Masterpiece in the universal language of cinemaM like Menace and MusicChildren are singing an elimination game of ominous undertones later we see little Elsie playing with the balloon a shadowy silhouette appears the face remains unrevealed while we hear the whistling of In the Hall of Mountain King Before the shark theme in Jaws to the Psycho shrieking violins the Peer Gynt tune became the first notable leitmotif meant to suggest an evil presence the perfect device to put us in the victims standpoint for the first act as powerlessly as the poor mother calling Elsie while her balloon the bait used by Hans Beckert is drifting along the telephone wiresThe effects are then shown through the growing fame of the new Jack the Ripper figure the ensuing paranoia with any adult basically talking to a child is assaulted The killer is a menace to an already crisisstricken society forcing the police department to triple the efforts psychiatric cases are explored handwriting analyzed and daily and nightly raids operated to make further pressure on the criminal worldM for Methodic For its second act M is the seminal police proceduralWhile covering that angle with a documentarylike precision Lang still seems dubious about the polices efficiency and provides an interesting twist by paralleling the work of the law with the outlaws In a long sequence where both sides brainstorm about the methods to use to find him we swing back and forth from one world to another and the only indicator of the side of the law were put in is the presence of uniform last time I saw criminals acting like politicians in a masterpiece it was in The Godfather One even points out insightfully that the killer must be a bourgeois because its the very standard of life that provides the level of idleness driving any easily corruptible mind to the most extreme cornersM like the sign on the shoulderSo in a famous sequence criminals helped by the street beggars find Hans Beckert quicker than the police force he was betrayed by his trademark whistling and irony a little girl who noticed the infamous letter marked on his shoulder The following chase takes maybe too much time for the films own good Not saying the film could do without the struggle to catch him but the court is such a high point of cinemas history that the previous part seems more forgettableAnd Peter Lorre with his round face innocent eyes when hes cornered like a rat and utters his memorable speech gives the performance of a lifetime as a living symptom a man incarnating the sickness of a society where bad people toy with justice and the worst of all acts as childishly as his victims claiming innocence with such rabid eloquence hes almost convincingBeckert says he cant control his impulses a little voice urges him to commit the irreparable acts and his body language is simply gutwrenching when he simply cant put words His lawyer makes a good point about the past of some accusers whose Becket call hypocrites because they could choose to be honest but the accusers retort that whether hes responsible or not hes still a menace Sure whether their reasons are selfish or ethical is debatable but can we empathize with Beckert?M like ModernityLooking at Twitter or Youtube or Facebook comments today you can tell theres something ferocious and still ongoing about mob mentality and a film like M could be deemed as feeble and liberal in the way it provides a tribune to a child molester the worst possible crimeM like MultilayeredYet there are some powerful truths hiding underneath the thriller the truth about a society sick of its own contradictions determined to impose standards of morality white and condemning true crimes black but indulgent toward activities that have no worse repercussion That the film ends with blackclad mothers admitting their own responsibility is perhaps the most optimistic thing about M the sentence doesnt matter what matters is the lesson behind but did German learn the lesson?Ironically one could have seen the rise of the Nazi empire as the antidote like Thea Von Sarbou who wrote the film and worked for the Nazi regime other could also see it as its worst possible consecration like director Fritz Lang That he didnt side with the criminals at the end emphasizes an intuitive comprehension of his world and allowed this film to be hailed as a true intelligent nightmarish and alas premonitory masterpiece with M as the mark of a disillusioned geniusM like Meditative? Mysterious? Mantic?Interestingly the French title is M le Maudit meaning the doomed one as if Beckert was the living incarnation of a doomed society as if there was indeed something rotten in the Weimar Republic and It wouldnt get any better after but could Fritz Lang anticipate it? Looking up his second masterpiece M I was wondering whether Lang reflected his own rejection of German society or cared enough to warn the audience against the impending doom of decadenceSurely the director behind Metropolis could only pinpoint with the accuracy of a soothsayer the limits of a civilization that might take its heritage for granted,9
666,tt0022100,This movie has it all! This is one of my alltime favorite movies Many people have criticized it because its from  and I say Who cares when you have such a great movie? Peter Lorre gives a  star performance as the child murderer and may I say he is very very haunting Fritz Langs direction is superb; the cinematography is superb! The kangaroo court scene at the end is my favorite part and its brilliantly done The plot is very well crafted Even more amazing is the plot focuses around catching the murderer but it is not boring for one second Each scene flows beautifully into the next with some amazing chases raids and facial expressions This is also a movie ahead of its time This is definitely one of the alltime best movies!,10
667,tt0022100,Fritz Langs second absolute landmark after the equally brilliant but completely different Metropolis and also his first opportunity to work with the wonders of sound And boy did he ever deliver a great piece of work! Like the M for murderer is marked on Peter Lorres coat the film M for masterpiece is branded on cinema history annals for all eternity Langs film is a triumph in every possible viewpoint and it covers a lot more genres and elements than just simply the manhunt for a childmolester*** SPOILERS ****The horrors M handles about is timeless and of all cultures but yet itll always remain a taboo subject and for that reason alone Fritz Lang deserves extra praising In an utterly astonishing way Peter Lorre portrays Hans Beckert a child murderer who singlehandedly terrorizes four and half million people simply by his uncontrollable urge to kidnap and molest young schoolgirls The grim and haunting atmosphere is terrifically built up by images of previous Beckertvictims and the disappearance a new unfortunate girl Her toy rolling of a remote hillsa balloon drifting away on the wind Really simple but extremely efficient methods to reflect the ominous actions that just took place Other than to focus on the further actions of the killer Lang turns to the effect this terror has on the city and how the manhunt for Beckert develops Our director is obviously fascinated by how a police procedure is organized and he serves the viewer a detailed overview of all the steps taken by the investigators Meanwhile he grabs the opportunity to forcefully criticize the medias influence and the German law system with both hands Id really like to stress that Langs subtle mockery was a really risky thing to do with the upcoming Nazireign so you cant admire him enough Due to the constant and fruitless raids the police are holding in the hope to capture the killer the criminal underworld begins to lose its profits as well and they start their own manhunt for the killer assisted by whores beggars and petty thieves With the carefully observing eyes all over town it becomes practically impossible for Becker to satisfy his monstrous needs The almighty Peter Lorre arrives late in the film every moment hes on screen is a moment worth treasuring His sad appearance and cruel testimony are sequences that leave no human being unmoved Lorre is a brilliant actor and this is inarguably one of the most impressive performances of all time M features constant tension outstanding dialogue and stunning camerawork As said before Fritz Lang had the opportunity to work with sound for this film and he immediately makes the most out of this This was the first big German production that featured sound and it STILL ranks as the title that made best use of itand that sure means something after more than  years Theres the chilling and legendary tune Lorre constantly whistles but also the absence of sound Lang uses to portray the besieged city As you can tell from the above review M is absolute mustsee and easily one of the most essential productions ever shot Its lightyears ahead of its time and still disturbing after all these years This film is a mesmerizing portrait about the darkest most alarming aspects of humanity and yet still it doesnt live up to reallife facts As you probably know the plot of M is based on the whereabouts of the serial killer Peter Kürten who brutally murdered many victims in the city of Düsseldorf I read a biography on Kürten recently and the true details of his crimes and animallusts go beyond every filmmakers wildest imagination,10
668,tt0022100,Since I loved Metropolis and was mesmerized by the great storyline of M I happily shelled out  euros to get the deluxe DVDset of Fritz Langs first talkie fully expecting I was going to view it over and over againWell that was  euros I should have spent on a new haircut or something This is a very boring film one that is only somewhat redeemed by a great Peter Lorre and an interesting final scene But the first hour was sooo slooow! Low point was a tenminute scene in which four boring men were having a roundtable about deciding what to do about the child killer No camera movement whatsoever just blabbering and no oneliners either Hes a killer for heavens sake  ACTION! DO SOMETHING! STOP HIM! Looking back maybe I was even more mesmerized by the brand M The film posters are great and that single M just makes for a classic even harrowing logoStill I honestly cant believe that a modern viewer would actually enjoy this,4
669,tt0022100,From the elongated opening scene of M you know you are in for more than a simple film could ever imagine The elongated lunch scene as a mother waits for her daughter to return as we audience members watch the daughter stray from her journey home with a stranger with a sharpened whistle It is foreboding it is depressing it is mesmerizing It has been a very long time since a film especially one made  years ago seemed so delicate so thought provoking so timeless as M does From these opening shots Lang lets us know that this isnt going to be your happy utopia where criminals are caught the next day by the police and our world goes back to liquorish and lollipops but instead a world where the locals collect like a mob and trust is thrown violently out of the window With excellent cinematography and a strong balance between humor and honesty Lang creates this visceral world where the line between truth and justice get blurred where good and evil are similar and a man defines his actions as uncontrollable This merely scratches the surface of M a masterful film that ranks amongst the best this world has offeredWhat makes M shoot ahead of anything modern anything by cult directors anything close to popular? It begins with the actors goes to the man behind the camera and finally the skillful craftsmanship of the story Each of these elements never lack never fall behind and constantly build upon each other until that final breath that encourages you to repetitively rewatch To begin Peter Lorre How could you not talk about M without mentioning this doeeyed murderer From the beginning we know his role in this film yet Lang pulls every emotion out of us as we follow his route We feel sympathy for Lorre when he is tried we feel scared when he is trapped in the attic we feel hatred when he voyeuristically looks at the children  and yet he isnt the only character in this film Lang introduces us to other well placed personas throughout The infamous Inspector Lohmann not to mention that great floorup shot is the perfect example of Langs impressions on the local German police The fact that Lohmann whistles counter productive to what Lorre represents only solidifies that idea To add to these already dynamic people we have the background criminals that decide to take the matter into their own hands in hopes to eliminate the looming police presence The Safecracker is idealistic of what Germany was to become the classic SS look with the idea of eliminating the opportunity to be tried in a true court of law Each one of these characters provide humor excitement and fullblown emotion to the screen adding to the overall impact to this film With Lorre already bedazzling us with his range and taut emotion it is up to Fritz Lang himself to ensure that edits angles and direction doesnt hinder the power of his actors Lang steps up to the plate and delivers with his avantgarde film making I use the words avantgarde because the techniques used in this film are far beyond  Lang incorporates powerful closeups amazing track following and shots nearly unseen at this time The overhead shots the ability to make the crowds look ravenous the camera puns adds just as much as another lead would If you were impressed by his ability in Metropolis M is only going to solidify that idea of Lang A favorite is the raid on the office complex by a group of criminals Every shot every detail is directed with ease but complexity It is easy to be in awe of this film but to take the time to see Langs ability behind the camera will take M to a whole new level Personally it is my belief that he announces himself with this film A pioneer of the camera a grandfather of what cinema is today  one cannot watch anything released today and not see Langs influences See Finchers Zodiac a nearly identical film in themes to what Lang was trying to produce hereFinally we have acting and direction but one must also credit the story for being not just creative and unflinchingly original but for supporting a strong message The idea of being more careful was impressive to watch due to the time being  a time well thought of that children could be anywhere without any worry The story brings evil into an American thought that good guys always prevail that suburbia is always safe and that the police actually do keep the streets safe The story of M challenges you as a viewer even today one could argue even more so today than in  With crimes continually on the rise in this country with the idea that pleading insanity cures the disease of murder or is an easy innocence the idea of M especially that final dialogue seems more important today The fascination also arises with the concept of the mob within this story  the horror that simple events kindness even could turn on anyone in a moment of panic Police arresting anyone that even looks at children in a peculiar way  a fascinating concept that Lang is not afraid to develop Imagine if this film were made two years later what a different theme Lang would have tackledA deeply enticing film Fritz Lang proves that he was a ground breaker in his field Not only could he handle Science Fiction but nearly every other genre imaginable M is no exception to his skill If you have not seen this film watch it  experience it  know what it means to be marked like Lorre Grade ***** out of *****,10
670,tt0022100,Im a fan of Peter Lorres and I love black &amp; white films  I enjoy foreign films  I even like trying to twist my brain around mindboggling symbolfilled convoluted art flicks  But I was incredibly disappointed in *M*It had a lot of potential but it kept drowning in itself  It took me a while to understand this  The plot itself wasnt overly complex  so why did I still have the feeling of unpleasant confusion  What I finally realized is that *M*s downfall is that it cant decide what it isI went into it with a general understanding of what it was going to be about and knowing Peter Lorres work I had certain expectations  The parts of the movie that were most satisfying to me were those which fit those expectations a tense shadowy atmosphere made all the more eerie and suspenseful by the skillful use of In the Hall of Mountain KingOther parts of the movie felt more like a police procedural  There is certainly a place for the Ed McBains of our world but that place is not being mixed in with Robyn Cook  These segments felt out of place and they jarringly interrupted the mood created by the spookier more emotionally taut scenesThe muchapplauded ending had the same problem for me it suddenly introduced yet another mood  that of introspection and social consciousness  This was too distinct from either of the other two moods to feel as if it were even part of the same pictureEach mood each theme each general strain could have been very good on its own  but as a package the film felt illblended  And as much as I enjoy paradox and even confusion they are not in of themselves sufficient criteria for a good film,3
671,tt0025316,Frank Capras idealistic outlook on life is evident in his films From It Happened One Night to Its a Wonderful Life Capra has always had a tendency to let the little guy rise above it all and beat the odds It is no small wonder that Capra enjoyed much of his success during the Depression when movies were used to truly pull an audience out of the despair of the s into a world where anything can happen where being a nice person is all you need to succeed While the fact that the country was in the middle of the Depression was not completely ignored an overly optimistic view on life was taken to counter the despair of everyday lifeThere were many points in It Happened One Night where the true state of the country was indicated Homeless people hitching rides on trains seemed perfectly normal Rather than regard them with apprehension and pity you smile and wave at them Another example is the hostile reaction proprietor Zekes wife had to the fact that her husband had let Peter and Ellie stay the night with promises of being paid Upon seeing Peter and Ellies car missing they rush to the cottage to see if Peter and Ellie are still there They cannot afford freeloadersIn another scene a childs mother has passed out from hunger because they have no money to buy food Peter and Ellie have nearly depleted their funds but decide that the mother and child need money more than they do and give some to themDespite these instances the movie was altogether cheerful in its depiction of the world In the throes of the stock market crash this movie signaled the birth of the screwball comedy At a time when the country needed release they could find that release and laughter in movies like It Happened One Night Audiences were amused by scenes in the film such as the segment in which Peter teaches Ellie how to dunk a donut Or when forced to share a room Peter puts a blanket between his and Ellies beds and calls it the `wall of Jericho which is revisited when the walls of Jericho come tumbling down after Peter and Ellies marriage Probably the most famous scene in the film is the hitchhiking sequence which features Peter standing by the roadside trying to thumb a ride unsuccessfully finally giving up after more than a dozen cars speed by without paying any heed to his attempts After he gives up beaten Ellie simply lifts her skirt above her knee The first car that passes stops as we see extreme closeups of a foot slamming down on the brakes and a hand applying the hand brakeA master in his profession Capra left his mark on the films he directed With an almost childlike cheerfulness he maintains a sense of dignity and class The viewer is left with a feeling of hope for humankind even if its only that a persons ideals could be used to make such a film Capras films are still regarded as masterpieces It Happened One Night arguably remains to this day unparalleled in screwball comedies It was one of many movies made during the Depression a sometimes sad and even lonely time in our history It gave its audience a chance to escape and forget their troubles for a few moments in time out of  stars,9
672,tt0025316,In his autobiography The Names Above the Title Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters the hero the heroine the comedian and the villainWhat Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films the characters of hero and comedian are combined Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself especially with that system all her own But in doing what he did for Clark Gables character Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the moldCapras autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio along the lines of Republic or Monogram As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it Capra also had a stroke of good luck Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day drunk as a skunk is priceless Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldnt have been more cooperativeAt some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day So the publicity drums were beatThe rest as they say is history It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam Best Picture Best Director Best Actor and Best Actress It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios And it set the standard for screwball comedyThe film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert Theyre together for most of the film so if it doesnt click between the two of them you have people walking out in droves Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in Gable and Colbert did only one other film together Boom Town for MGM You cant get much more different than those two films Boom Town had a huge MGM budget Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein Its also a great film but its not a classic like It Happened One Night,10
673,tt0025316,It Happened One Night directed by Frank Capra was made and released in  by Columbia Pictures as a small budget film that was not expected to do well at the box office Yet after its release the film gained many accolades and won the Academy Award for best picture in  Due to the original small nature of the film the leading man role was surprisingly filled by Clark Gable who was on loan from another studio He stared opposite of Claudette Colbert Capras film was a combination of many ideals emotions and social perceptions of the American society of the thirties but it was also a combination of many new and innovative filming techniques and sound advancements The film unfolds the story in such a attentiongrabbing and remarkable way that most of todays cinema use his style and ideals when producing and creating films Capra used the idea of a moving camera one that was not fixed upon a box but on a moveable crane instead This produced more sweeping shots more angles for filming and fewer distance shots It allowed for more movement of the actors as well as a more realistic and real life feeling to the movie The film also incorporates back projection of images This is were a scene is filmed previously and played in the background while the actors perform the scene in front of the projection Back projection is used for car scenes to give the impression that the actors are driving but in reality they are in a sound stage Capra also incorporated the use of a wipe in his film The technique of moving left to right and fading in or out to change a scene or show elapsed time took the place of the traditional place cards in silent films and allowed for a more constant stream for the film The film was also all talk the new technology of a sound strip on the side of the film was used The text cards of silent films were completely discarded Another camera trick by Capra is to show a change in feelings within Clark Gables character for Claudette Colberts character by depicting her character in a different light This happens two times within the film at key moments to the development of their relationship Claudette Colbert is seen in a close up of softer light to emphasize Clark Gables character seeing her in a `different light In this romantic comedy Capra not only showed new styles and techniques but also addressed social issues of the time Through comedy he showed the outlandish nature of the rich King arriving for his own wedding in a helicopter and the nature of man being the controller in relationships as well as in society The fighting and struggles between the two main characters showed the man taking care of the woman the social norms of how men and woman should act around each other in that era But the fighting and the banter also show a strongminded and intelligent woman The two strongwilled main characters balanced each other outCapras techniques for showing the social relationship between the rich and working classes as well as a relationship between man and woman in the s captured film makers and film viewers for over  years Films are now compared to his style of camera movement and his style of capturing the American ideals When movies of today make a similar statement of achieving what one wants they are referred to as Capraesc Capras imagination and style is one that changed the outlook of American films and introduced a new genre to film goers everywhere,0
674,tt0025316,IHON rightly earns its place as one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history A pioneer of the screwball comedy genre it holds up very well  years after it was madeIts a classic tale of the battle of sexes something that is still so relevant today We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Claudette Colbert who jumps ship from her fathers yacht literally! in Florida after an argument with said father played by Walter Connolly over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley Jameson Thomas without her fathers consent Ellie is on a mission to get to New York to King Westley But how will she do it? Thats how Peter Warne played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable comes into the story Recently fired from his newspaper job Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York and realizing who she is Her story is all over the news after all! offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story to win him back his job And so the fun begins Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances The trip isnt a smooth one and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie which gives us great scenes such as the doughnutdunking lesson Walls Of Jericho and the nowclassic hitchhiking scene The humour is still fresh and fastpaced over  years later Oops I almost forgot the classic no undershirt scene where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses to reveal shock horror! no undershirt but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of mens undershirts which dropped dramatically after the films release One of the first examples of product placement in film Great supporting characters particularly the scenestealing Oscar Shapeley Roscoe Karns Of course it has its faults all early talkies do But any faults are outweighed by the great story Technically it was wellmade for its timeIHON won  Oscars Best Picture Best Director Frank Capra Best Actress and Best Actor for Colbert and Gable and Best Adaptation It deserved all of them Funnily enough both Colbert and Gable didn&amp;#;t want any part in the film at first I bet they changed their viewpoint after the surprise success and the prestigious Academy Awards they gained for it Its been said that a number of Disney characters like Bugs Bunny Yosemite Sam and Pepe LePew were inspired by characters in this film A classic a mustsee a great movie,10
675,tt0025316,This is a pleasant funny classic that shows it age only slightly and that has a lot of scenes you can look forward to each time that you see it Gable and Colbert each get roles that are nicely suited to them and are wellremembered for their performances  The supporting cast also rounds out the picture with some good character actingThe crosscountry trip on the bus and via other assorted methods is fun to watch with several nice vignettes that complement the main story line The atmosphere on the long bus trip is done especially well  The plot is of course not meant to be taken too seriously in itself but it comes in very handy for setting up good characters and comedyIt all comes across as effortlessly entertaining romantic comedy with some classic scenes and characters you learn to care for in spite of their mistakes,0
676,tt0025316,This sweet comedy never loses its appeal  Claudette Colbert is a spoiled young girl who meets a wordly attractive newspaper reporter Clark Gable In the beginning she treats him like a servant but he never knuckles under to this behavior  The interaction between these two is very romantic and humorous  It is the classic portrayal of what may be called sexual tension  He takes care of her  does not take advantage of her  but makes her realize that her wealthy background cannot carry her through as a human being she has to earn his respect by treating him with respect  There is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike and their breakfast is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find  As Gable stands at the edge of the road and Colbert is perched atop a wooden fence his wisecracking posture is said to be the inspiration for the beloved cartoon character Bugs Bunny  This is a mustsee for every one who loves old movies and entertaining for all,10
677,tt0025316,It Happened One Night is one of those films that is so classic and on so many `mustsee lists that I actually assumed that I had seen it at one time or another  It wasnt until I actually looked into the film when I in fact realized I hadntThe first film to sweep the major categories in an Oscar ceremony It Happened One Night spins the story of a young spoiled heiress Colbert who marries a shallow yet dashing aviator  She is then swept off by her father who takes her on a cruise; convinced that time away from each other will cure her infatuation  Instead she escapes by jumping out of the boat and swimming to shore where she begins her journey from Miami to New York where her husband awaits  The film quickly turns into an `on the road flick at this point when she meets up with Clark Gable a down on his luck reporter who offers to help her for the exclusive rights to her story  Mayhem inevitably ensues as one thing after another goes wrong during their adventureIm a little hesitant to completely agree with the general assessment that It Happened One Night is a screwball comedy  Of course there were certain moments that were hilarious and overdone the scene when Gable and Colbert pose as husband and wife to share a cabin for the night is absolutely rich but the majority of the remaining film is clever romantic comedy with fairly even performances by the principles  Perhaps there is a sliding scale for screwball comedies with It Happened One Night being a two and a film that I feel personifies the genre Bringing up Baby as a five,8
678,tt0025316,Consider this It Happened One Night was made in  which gives it the distinction + years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences And most of the runnerups for oldest film are s screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the  Academy Awards The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant The main reason It Happened One Night worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capras direction Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut Cohn told Capra That French broad likes money and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $ double her usual price and a guarantee that production would only last  days Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this filmThe film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra a great script that would play well with small town America and a good ensemble of supporting talent The story concerns a spoiled young heiress Colbert trying to escape the control of her father nicely played by Walter Connelly Dodging her fathers private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter Gable who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other brainless brat and obnoxious bully as an undisclosed affection develops On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each otherWhile the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film As another reviewer has written Far from loveydovey the dialogue is witty sharp and occasionally heartless We may know the outcome but the road to get there is paved with arguments anger and misunderstandings Its also clever funny and a bit risqué for   During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult motivated by a desire to improve her companions opinion of her Gable shows real star presence playing a confident charming and resourceful gentleman By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partnerAfter the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director OscarThen again what do I know? Im only a child,9
679,tt0025316,I have seen this movie a few times over the year and have just recently  viewed it again twice on the DVD version This is a highly recommended  movie on several levels First it has to be seen because it won  multiple academy awards during  It has won at least best actor best actress and best director  So it should be seen just for its historical significance if you are  into movies as an art form However if you are just looking for  entertainment then it is simply a great classic romantic comedy The  set up is that Ellie Claudette Colbert is a rich spoiled  independent woman who is running away from her father in Florida to  join her husband not quite a complete marriage in New York City She  meets Peter Clark Gable on the bus who is a down &amp; out reporter  looking for a big story They join forces in that he will help her to  get to New York for an exclusive on her story In essence it is the  bratty socialite vs the hard nosed know it all reporter  Can they  achieve true love? Just watch the movie and figure it out for  yourself There is the classical scene regarding the battle of the  sexes which involves hitchhiking There is some dated material because  the movie was made in the s about the s This may be both good  and bad as a viewing experience Gable is a bit too shallow as a  desirable character He lacks the sensitivity of a guy that would be in  a modern romantic comedy However his portrayal of Peter is likely  typical for the ideal man of the era in that he attempted to be  competent and in charge at all times the know it all guy The  character comes across as too simplistic by todays standards However  when he gets the feedback on his rough edges from Ellie he shows his  nice guy side Claudette Colbert is great in this movie she had  opportunities to display her acting craft as she responded to different  situations The scene in which she and Gable pretended to be basically  white trash was very funny Her getting the best actress award is  very evident even without having to see the performances of her  rivalries for the Oscar in  Overall this movie is rated a  and  is highly recommended A viewer may avoid older movies because they  lack dept; however hang in for this one Once the screen chemistry  starts between Colbert and Gable their first scene together the rest  of the picture is just a joyride of entertainment in watching these two  work their magic for the camera Enjoy this movie it should be an  awesome experience,0
680,tt0025316,In my college film class we had begun watching It happened one night I was laughing my head off But of course my professor stops the movie right when it was getting good After that I wanted to see this movie so badly My father lucky enough had the movie I watched it and it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen Clark Gable is histerical He really does a great job in the film I always did prefer the old comedies to today Do you blame me? If you watch the flick you will enjoy it This is one of the first romantic comedies Itll send all the others to the back of the bus I would higly recommend this movie Its a classic/,10
681,tt0025316,Released in  Frank Capras It Happened One Night ushered in a new era of Hollywood filmmaking  the screwball comedy  and made Academy Award history in the process It became the first film to be awarded the top five awards on the night Best Picture Director Actor Actress and Screenplay a feat that remained unequaled until One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  and The Silence of the Lambs  As I watch more of his films Frank Capra is fast becoming one of my most respected directors with such classics as Mr Smith Goes to Washington and Its a Wonderful Life ranking among my favourites of all time This screwball comedy however posed a certain problem since Ive never been a huge fan of the subgenre Whilst I had enjoyed such films as My Man Godfrey and His Girl Friday they hadnt really offered anything other than comedy This means that they did a good job of making us laugh but never really inspired any other emotions  which isnt necessarily a handicap but doesnt appeal to my tastesHappily Im able to announce that It Happened One Night did surpass my expectations and I found it to be a wonderfullyenjoyable very touching romantic comedy The first half had left me feeling a bit uncertain since it reminded me of just about every other s comedy Id seen but then Frank Capra did what Frank Capra does best he put a lot of heart into the film After building towards a perfect fairytale ending Capra suddenly snatches it away slowly but surely stacking the odds against our hero However the director has never been one to leave us with a downbeat ending and when love finally prevails it feels twice as triumphant Of course crucial to the films success are the two lead performers Claudette Colbert and Clarke Gable playing characters of completely polar characters As story runs its course we slowly watch their relationship transform from completely dislike to acceptance to romance and it never feels forced or artificial despite a reportedly tense atmosphere onsetThe plot of the film was based on the story The Night Bus by Samuel Hopkins Adams Ellie Andrews Colbert is the arrogant spoilt heiress of a wealthy father Walter Connolly After she marries the rich but unprincipled King Westley Jameson Thomas against her fathers will Ellie strikes off to New York to be with the man she loves and her desperate father launches a statewide attempt to retrieve her It is on a night bus that Ellie strikes up a frictional relationship with fired journalist Peter Warne Gable whose only initial interest in the stranded girl is a good newspaper story Probably one of the best road movies ever made It Happened One Night also has a few twists in the usual formula which have guaranteed its enduring stature For example Ellies father is revealed not to be an evil overbearing demon but is in fact shown to be a very kind reasonable and loving man who is only trying to guarantee the best for his daughter by ensuring that she marries somebody with principles King Westley later gives up the girl without a fuss compensated by a tidy sum of moneyMuch to my surprise Id never seen a film starring Clarke Gable before but he really was a revelation Never taking any situation too seriously and delivering every line with confidence and a hint of amusement Gable is the laidback everyman that the audience can relate to a stark contrast to Colberts conceited and ungrateful upperclass rich girl My favourite scene took place after the night bus accidentally ran off the road with the shifty passenger Oscar Shapeley Roscoe Karns threatening to reveal Ellies true identity Fearing that his exclusive story could leak into other hands Peter Warne declares himself to be the gangster who kidnapped Ellie threatens to harm Shapeleys family and then chases him into the night Interestingly I followed up my viewing of this film with a  Lux Radio Theater broadcast of the story introduced by Cecille B DeMille and once again starring Gable and Colbert This recording can be found if youre lucky as a special feature on the It Happened One Night DVD and its well worth a listen,8
682,tt0025316,I was inspired to think of other films with completely mystifying titles `The Phantom Menace obviously  Also `The Shop Around the Corner around the corner from WHERE? `The Empire Strikes Back it doesnt `The Living Daylights `True Lies `Batman Forever `Species `The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp  if anyone has any more suggestions please send them to meIn this case it happens over several nights and Im not sure which particular night is being referred to  Probably one of the candidate nights is less unobvious than the rest; so I guess the title isnt COMPLETELY mystifying  But actually Capra gives us the feeling that everything is up in the air  Everyone knows that the hero and heroine of romantic comedies are bound to get hitched in the end  in most cases its simply a question of staying awake  But Capra makes us feel the contingency of it all  I for one was convinced that right up until the final moment it could have gone either way  How did Capra manage this?  Was it because he was a complete innocent; or was it because he was remarkably sophisticated?  I dont suppose it matters its results that countIm glad to see very little mention among the comments about the sexism of it all  The characters have life; their words have life; and if such art as this could only be produced by a sexist society its almost worth creating a sexist society and then dismantling it in order to get the art  In modern romances I get the feeling that the writers are wearily writing `feisty lines for the heroine in an attempt to fool feminists who by and large arent so easily fooled  Claudette Colbert isnt feisty  When she DOES assert her independence she means itAnd of course when Clark Gable asserts his dominance HE means it  You dont get sincerity like this these daysAnyway the ideology of a film if there is one is always beside the point except inasmuch as the ideology is AESTHETICALLY attractive or unattractive This is an attractive film  Two real individuals a real story some misunderstanding but no tiresome or pointless misunderstanding constant wit  and as I expressed amazement at earlier constant suspense  And if THAT isnt enough to get you to watch it note that it was released in   The Hayes code didnt come into effect until   Not a moment too late,10

684,tt0025316,Capras It Happened One Night is a fascinatingly shot romantic comedy It has the s feel but at the same time I am surprised that such skill was used in the making of this movie during the s The camerawork is brilliant as it brings out both the spatial feel and the crowdiness the long shots are effective and I liked how the scenes change in a sideways flip mode Theres always something about the driving scenes of old classics that amuse me Clearly the background was shot separately and then projected on to a screen during the shooting of the film while in the foreground the actors are just seated in a car pretending to drive While the background scene changes the viewer keeps tuned to the wonderful dialogue between the actors Needless to add the films got fantastic dialogueCapra also brilliantly gives us a glimpse of the s American society especially focusing on gender and class status The difference between the upper class rich people and the common ordinary man is shown by their use of language and their nonverbal behaviour Yet in a way the film is also ahead of its time Ellie isnt just some clichéd damsel of the s She is strongminded stubborn and smart albeit slightly naive She is one who fights for what she wants rather than giving in easily Perhaps this is also one quality of hers that attracts Peter but at the same time their funny quarrels also indicate that there is a an equality in gender status which was something women were struggling with in those daysThe characters are very well etched Peter and Ellie were a lot of fun but I also liked how Alexander Andrews played excellently by Walter Connolly was written as the rich father whos got all the money but all he wants for his daughter is her happiness Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are great together as they match wits and display warm chemistryIt Happened One Night has become an instant favourite one that I definitely plan to revisit,0
685,tt0025316,IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT Columbia  directed by Frank Capra based on a short story Night Bus by Samuel Hopkins Adams ranks one of the best known and popular romantic comedies from the s thanks to the star chemistry of Clark Gable on loan from MetroGoldwynMayer and Claudette Colbert on loan from Paramount with fine direction by Frank Capra witty screenplay by Robert Risken and for being the very first motion picture to win all five major Academy Awards including Best Actor Gable; Best Actress Colbert; Best Director Capra; Best Screenplay and Best Picture This might have been an upset in  considering other toprated films and performances of the year but who would have imagined IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT to still be as entertaining today as it was back in ?This now wellknown plot thats been remade twice by Columbia as EVE KNEW HER APPLES  with Ann Miller and William Wright; and YOU CANT RUN AWAY FROM IT  with June Allyson and Jack Lemmon opens in a yacht in Miami where Ellen Ellie Andrews Claudette Colbert spoiled daughter of a millionaire Wall Street banker Alexander Andrews Walter Connolly who disapproves of her recent marriage to aviator King Westley Jameson Thomas making arrangements on having it annulled Following a heated argument with her father Ellie runs from her state room jumps overboard and swims to shore Eluding her fathers hired detectives Ellie acquiring new clothes purchases a night bus ticket bound for New York City where she plans to meet Westley While on board Ellen encounters Peter Warne Clark Gable a hotheaded reporter recently fired by his editor Joe Gordon Charles C Wilson With both disliking each other immensely Warne having discovered the spoiled brats identity becomes her constant traveling companion in order to get an exclusive story and his job back Hours before reaching New York and taking a rest stop in an auto camp misunderstandings occur as Ellen awakens to find both Peter and the car goneA simple story playing like an overlong B movie IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a memorable bus trip of so many classic scenes that have been imitated by others but never duplicated Highlights include the Walls of Jericho where Peter and Ellen share a room in auto camps where a blanket is tossed over a rope that separates the couple as they sleep for the night; Peter demonstrating to Ellen on how a man undresses particularly one in which he removes his shirt to no undershirt underneath; Peters correct method of dunking a doughnut into a cup of coffee; and the classic hitchhiking scene where Peter fails to attract cars while Ellen comes up with a method all her ownAlthough IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is essentially a Claudette Colbert movie from start to finish theres no secondary female character quite rare for its time Due to the strength of Gables performance this has been hailed to be his best comedic role Gables character is hotheaded and forceful living by a moral code Although he shares a cabin with a married woman thats all he does He even tells Colberts Ellie when she asks if shell ever see him again he replies I make it a policy not to run around with married women And when hes hungry he takes a carrot from a farm rather than going through the method of panhandling This is Gable a role model Director Frank Capra whose subject matter is usually on people captures the many extras especially those on the bus and auto camps to make them appear as important as leading players Roscoe Karns is equally memorable believe you me! as the gabby bus passenger Oscar Shapeley from Orange New Jersey; Ward Bond as the tough talking bus driver; the meek Arthur Hoyt and the nosy/ domineering Blanche Frederici as the auto camp owners; Georgie Breakston the poor boy traveling on the bus with his mother Claire McDowell; along with other passengers gathered together and singing The Man on the Flying Trapeze to a player of a snoring fat and bald man who rests his head on Colberts shoulder During its entire  minutes theres seldom any underscoring As for the costumes with the exception of the final  minutes both Gable and Colbert use the same clothing through most of their tripWhile Gable and Colbert had challenging roles in their careers plus their reunion in MGMs largescale BOOM TOWN  its amazing how this likable little comedy was the only one to honor them Academy Awards Theres a scene where I feel Gable earned his statuette the one where he tells Ellen the type of girl he would like to someday marry saying that those kind of women dont exist anymore Gable says this with frankness and sincerity Colbert on the other hand earned hers from that same scene as she she listens and looks on lovingly at Gable with tears flowing down her cheek coming to realize it happened one nightIT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT not only became a perennial favorite on late night television during the s and s but on cable TV as well ranging from the Disney Channel s American Movie Classics prior to  to Turner Classic Movies and availability on video cassette and finally DVD While IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT has aged in appearance its still timely screen entertainment Therell never be another film like this again ***/,9

687,tt0025316,A spoiled heiress Claudette Colbert running away from her family is helped by a man Clark Gable who is actually a reporter looking for a storyIn this film a pampered socialite tries to get out from under her fathers thumb and falls in love with a roguish reporter which you know is something that happens when spoiled daughters discover that they want to live like common people and do what common people do like go to supermarketsThe film was the first to win all five major Academy Awards Best Picture Director Actor Actress and Screenplay a feat that would not be matched until One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  and later by The Silence of the Lambs  And it is not really surprising when you see it besides it is Clark Gable and Frank CapraSo this might not be as outright funny as other films and even as far as screwball comedies go it sort of lags behind The Awful Truth with Cary Grant But Clark Gable has a debonair charm to him from the very beginning he has that attitude about him that women mysteriously love I am a little confused about the laidback approach to marriage and annulment but this is a romance and that is not uncommon if anything it shows how fickle the socialite isOverall a very enjoyable film Not my favorite of the era but well worth a watch or two And heck if such a film can inspire the creation of Bugs Bunny and entertain Joseph Stalin can it be so bad?,8
688,tt0025316,Peter a washed up journalist accidentally bumps into Ellen Andrews a spoiled daughter of a rich guy from whom she ran away on a bus while taking a trip to New York He offers to help her hide from her dad if she agrees to sell her story only to him But on their way to New York they fall in loveThere are many old classic film that are excellent but leave you with a Yeah greatbut I expected something else feeling But It happened one night is one of those films that leaves you amazed without any reservations I was neither a Clark Gable Claudette Colbert or a Frank Capra fan before I saw this road movie which won  Oscars but after I did I became of fan of them for life! The story here is so damn simple that you may at first think that everyone could be able to pull it of but when you think about it you will realize that at the same time its actually very clever carefully written and touching Take this scene for instance Ellen is looking in front of herself while a burglar steals her luggage behind her back She doesnt notice anything but Peter sees this and runs after the burglar Ellen still not turning around is wondering where he is running of to After a while Peter all tired returns and says He got away! And Ellen not knowing whats going on replies I dont know what you are talking about! Thats a perfect example how someone is trying to be a gentleman and ends up as a fool But this is actually a film more touching than funny After a while the spoiled Ellen shows her gentle side and realizes that she loves Peter She says this to her father in tears because she thinks that Peter doesnt love her So incredibly magical and yet so simple Its incredibly high grade of / on the site rottentomatoescom is justified Too bad almost all TV stations are keeping this jewel of air for decades! No wonder my generation is trapped in a vicious circle of violence drugs and alcohol They never got a glimpse of such previous generations with a soul and such raw honest and touching beauty like It happened one night which exceeds the human mindGrade /,10
689,tt0025316,Its a true call that they dont make the movies as they used to There are very less movies coming near to the brilliance of It Happened One Night This movie is about a rich brat running from her home to get married with her lover accompanied with struggling free lancer reporter in her journey And in the journey they fall for each other The romance building between two of them is nicely depicted and the blend of Peter Warne Gables arrogant personality gives it a nice stir The story of the movie is very interesting and the comic attribute added by both Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is sufficed to make anyone laugh The perfect direction from the master of his domain Frank Capra takes the movie on highest level; because of this its the first movie to be honored with all major five Oscars Best Actor Best Actress Best Movie Best Director and Best Screenplay,10
690,tt0025316,It Happened One Night happens to be my personal most favorite film ever It was an adapted screenplay by Robert Riskin from the short story Night Bus and was directed by Frank Capra With a simple story plot modest budget and a very short four week production schedule this film goes a long way Director Frank Capra obviously knew the story to tell and how to tell it Some of the best films are made in a surprisingly short amount of time and on a modest budget This film followed what Capra hoped would be a critical and box office success The hopes were low for this film even after securing stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert for the lead roles Columbia Studios was not well respected at the time in HollywoodIt Happened One Night  had a relatively small budget for its time $ of which Claudette Colbert asked for and received $ for her role A star receiving this much of the total film budget was unheard of during the s Released during Americas Great Economic Depression the film had excellent timing and proved to be a big critical and audience hit All the right elements came together It had a high quality comedic screenplay with believable characters in believable situations A film where luck and chemistry came together producing a film that exceeded the expectations of everyone involved including its director Frank CapraThe film comes across as light hearted and natural and with excellent timing and pacing For its time this style of film was new It would be one of the first of a new genre screwball romantic comedy Winner of five Academy Awards in all the major categories Best Picture Director Adapted Screenplay Actor in a Leading Role and Actress in a Leading Role was a first in Hollywood history Only two other films have swept the five top Academy Awards One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest  and The Silence of the Lambs Claudette Colbert was quoted as saying I just finished the worst film ever on It Happened One Night She had no idea how well the film would be edited The film editing here is subtle and sublime Colbert and Gable achieved that rare and special screen chemistry in the film Colberts demand that the film needed to be produced in four weeks because of her vacation schedule actually created the lively pace of the film working in its favor It Happened One Night is a fine example of a quality screenplay some good luck and a lot of chemistry all coming together producing an enduring and enjoyable comedy classicClark Gable comes across as completely natural and very entertaining The fun had while making this film shows partly in Gables performance Unfortunately he would not be cast in a comedic role again even after the big success of this film The studio system of the time demanded stars remain typecasted For Gable that meant macho romantic leading action manTo me It Happened One Night is the best ever romantic comedy film a gold standard for its genre Its lost none of its charm and naturalness since its release in  The look of the film dates it but it still delivers its original naturalness charm wittiness timing pacing and entertainment value Just about a perfectly made film,10
691,tt0025316,It Happened One Night must have put on a smile on Depressionweary audiences way back in  Over  years later the magic still works due to the terrific combination of Gable Colbert and director CapraBut it almost didnt happen at allBoth Gable and Colbert tried desperately to get out of doing IHON In fact it appeared noone in Hollywood wanted the parts of Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews The tiny cashstrapped Columbia Studios was making this film with an untried comedy formula it looked a certain flop Pfft How wrong everyone was IHON swept the Academy Awards taking home all of the Major Awards including Best Actor and Actress Awards for Gable and Colbert It established the screwball comedy genre and the careers of its two stars and director CapraWhy is it so good? Well it has remained so fresh over the years that the laughs beat out almost every modern romantic comedy It doesnt have to rely on smut or toilet humour to satisfy the audience just a classic battle of the sexes we can all relate to Its witty the dialogue is snappy and fastpaced and the acting is near perfect So lets have a closer look at the plot of this gem Spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Colbert has just defied her father by marrying society aviator King Westley Her angry father wishes to keep Ellie away from her unsuitable husband and whisks her away on his private yacht Daddy hasnt counted on Ellies tenacity and will fed up with the fact her childish hungerstrike is going nowhere she literally jumps overboard When back on dry land she tries to make her way back to her husband by bus trip A series of unfortunate events bring out of work newspaper reporter Peter Warne into her life Cue the battle of the sexes! She has no money so she must accept his help; he knows who she is and to land the biggest scoop of his career he must deceive her whilst also helping her get back to Westley But problems arise when the pair inevitably start to fall in loveThis film is just the tonic that Depression audiences would have soaked up The parodying of the rich is sublime you cant help rooting for Gable who is a fine representative of the underdog It also has its risqué elements that Im surprised got past the Hayes Code that had just been enforced In particular Gables sexy lesson to a shocked yet interested Colbert on how a man undresses and the final breaking down the walls of Jericho scene When Gable undressed to reveal a bare chest with NO undershirt sales dropped off dramatically This would be one of the earliest examples of product placement in filmSome of my favourite scenes the donutdunking lesson the piggyback ride Gable and Colberts mock fight and the justifiably classic Hitchhiking scene Colbert beats the cocky Gable at his own game by proving that SHE doesnt have to use her thumb to pull a ride Instead she shows a bit of leg and stops a vehicle much to the horror of Gable Great stuff!This film almost singlehandedly established the great screwball comedy Colberts Ellie is the ultimate screwy damepaving the way for Lombard and Hepburn in the genre with Gables Peter a direct forerunner to the Fredrich March character in the screwball classic Nothing Sacred  This films holds a very important place in motion picture historyBest of all its so enjoyable/,10
692,tt0025316,The first movie to sweep all the major Academy Awards this film is still popular today Thats probably so because the dialog between the two stars of the picture  Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert  is just great Those two make this fun to watch I enjoyed it however much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect The ending too was very weak Over the last  minutes the two stars go their separate ways until the very end and the story gets very stupidThe nice romance that had developed between the two seemed to have disintegrated when Gable left one early morning for good intentions but didnt tell Colbert The latter thought Gable ran out on her Hollywood in films of the s and s loved to have romances in which confusion abounded and everything was misinterpreted for the worstuntil the happy ending when the truth somehow would surface That same theme was in here along with yet another trivialization of marriage another common theme during the classic era Colbert says it herself in one line mentioning she doesnt care for this other guy but what the heck might as well get married whats the difference? Huh?If the scriptwriters here would have just kept the road part of this film going longer  with Gable and Colbert trading barbs  it would have been super Gable has the best lines an is the most fun to watch but Colbert can hold her own She looks really pixieish and cute although most of her closeups are done with a fuzzy lens another habit of filmmakers of that era had with female stars One of the film worlds most famous scenes is in this movie the hitchhiking scene in which the cocky Cable explains the different ways of successful thumbing in order to get a rideand gets nowhere while Colbert on her first try gets a car to stop immediately after she lifts up her skirt! That is still one of the great comedic scenes in movie historyOverall this is still one of the best comedies of The Golden Age even with its faults,8
693,tt0025316,A cute love story that rivals any of the cookiecutter romantic comedies of today Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert play very well off of each other Sure its cheesy in parts but thats what makes these older movies so much fun,8
694,tt0025316,Its been over eighty years since It Happened One Night debuted on screens and still it remains the quintessential romantic comedy to watch While being the influence of countless films since It Happened One Night is triumphant and timeless because of its great cast director and script At the start of the film we see the beautiful Ellen Andrews Claudette Colbert in Florida aboard her wealthy fathers luxury boat Ellen is planning to marry King Westley but her father disapproves of him and forces her to stay on the boat until he can find someone more suitable to his liking This leads her to run away and seek out Westly herself while her father puts out a highly publicized bounty for her return She boards a bus to New York and crosses paths with the charismatic Peter Warne Clark Gable Hes a gifted newspaper reporter who also has a drinking problem that constantly gets him in trouble Once Warne figures out who Ellen really is he proposes a plan to her He will escort her to New York for the rights to her story which has become a national headline While the seemingly mismatched pair goes on an adventure they eventually warm up and become close The plot flies at a freeflowing pace that allows for wickedly good oneliners The script is fantastic and allows for great comedic timing and also a sense of drama There is a bit of suspense as the willthey wontthey couple explore their feelings for each other While watching the film you get the sense that they will end up together but its never fully guaranteed and leaves room for you to doubt We meet several supporting characters that mostly never overstay their welcomes such as the bumbling Shapeley and boisterous Zeke They are great in the small amount of time they get and dont distract from the main narrative One minor problem with the story is that the geography is very confusing The audience is left out of the loop when it comes to knowing where exactly the leads are This makes it hard to track the importance of each settingThis is the prime example and maybe founding of the screwball comedy Screwball comedies tell the story of two leads often an unmarried man and woman that come from different social classes and how they interact with each other based on their previous lifestyles If you like films such as Heaven Can Wait and Raising Arizona you should thank this film for popularizing the genre Frank Capra won the academy award for Best Director for this film and he totally deserved it He balances his cast well and allows them to have total freedom within the cramped space of the frame He pushes the camera for claustrophobic scenes that force the actors to work together to make the physical comedy work The acting is the definite draw and best part of the film Both Gable and Colbert took home academy awards for their performances Gable will go down as one of the best romantic leads ever Hes handsome quick on his feet and witty He also delivers the perfect oneliners with confidence and swagger to make women want him and men to want to be him Colbert does an excellent job as the uptight and bratty female that so many leading ladies are still trying to replicate almost eighty years later She perfectly embodies a rich girl that is out of her element while in the real world She bounces off Gables laid back working man character with ease and her oneliners are just as good or even better than his Walter Connolly also does a good job as Ellies wealthy father Alexander Andrews He plays the overprotective but also understanding father At first he wants Ellen to marry someone rich and famous in order to boost his social status but after seeing her unhappiness he changes and sees the errors of his ways Hes one of those fathers that every girl wants and every man should strive to be It Happened One Night is the biggest influence on the romantic comedy genre Having the great pair of Gable and Colbert and Capra as the director lifts this film to the heavens of classic cinema Even in  the film is still fun and can be used to teach writers how to create good comedy,7
695,tt0025316,OMG this film so hilarious clever and sweet It has original story and fresh idea about romantic comedy Clark Gable really did excellent job to bring this film more live He is so funny clever and comical Everything that he is doing in this film look so natural and funny Definitely one of Clarks best performance He really deserve an Oscar for his performance Chemistry between he and Claudette Colbert very delightful and cute Just simply romantic Bravo!!!,10
696,tt0012349,While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplins later features The Kid is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicelyWhile its a fairly simple story this is one of Chaplins most efficiently designed movies  Every scene either is necessary to the plot or is very funny for its own sake or both  Except for Chaplin and Coogan most of the other characters even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance are just there to advance the plot when needed and the two leads are allowed to carry the show which they both do extremely wellThe Kid is also impressive in that while the story is a sentimental one it strikes an ideal balance maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies  Here the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorableThis is one of Chaplins very best movies by any measure  If you enjoy silent comedies dont miss it,0
697,tt0012349,Ive always thought theres a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies even unsentimental ones like Keatons The General or Laurel and Hardys Way Out West The latter comedy has a scene where L&amp;H perform a softshoe dance; it always brings me to tears Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that Im laughing doesnt dilute the emotional chargeOne of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already Why not marry the two things? Thats what he did in some of his early short films and thats what he does in this feature comedy The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie Jackie Coogan away Meanwhile the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesnt know if shell ever find out what became of himJackie Coogan about five in this film with his charming manners his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy is one of the alltime great child actors Want more evidence of Chaplins genius? Coogan doesnt steal the film from him This is true even though Chaplin as producer star and director makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boys talents Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles like My Boy and Oliver TwistChaplins storytelling—even with the foolish subDickensian plot twists such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed The windowbreaking scene the flophouse scene the dream sequence the tryingtogetridofthebaby scene—theyre perfect Chaplins celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselvesWant me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know I cant even complain about that Its too sweetly naïve And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the very few flawsOne important note children love this movie Show it to them while theyre young and youll make Chaplin fans of them And thats better than their becoming fans of almost anything thats being peddled to them,0
698,tt0012349,Wow is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so That fact that it still entertains over  years after it was made is quite a testimony It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama Charlie Chaplins unique humor combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember Chaplins humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stuntsThe kid  Jackie Coogan  is just as memorable maybe even more so He is unbelievably cute especially in those oldtime clothes he wore Watching the expressions on his face even as a baby are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent eraSo between Chaplin and Coogan and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next its an amazing piece of work This is a very fastpaced story which lasts less than an hourThe special edition twodisc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear actually astounding for its age Excellent entertainment,9
699,tt0012349,THE KID First National Pictures  a comedydrama written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  plays an important part his screen career Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIES PUNCTURED ROMANCE  a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies but releases coming once every two to three years A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in  eventually under the supervision and direction of himself Chaplins methods in movie making improved with each passing film Like himself Jackie Coogan Chaplins littlest costar and title character made such an impression with his initial performance nearly upstaging his impresario that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own becoming Hollywoods first important child starTHE KID starts off with intertitles A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear followed by The woman whose sin was motherhood titles much to the liking of a DW Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish yet in fact might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplins whose very name personifies comedy A young girl Edna Purviance leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father Carl Miller a young artist never returns to her life The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away Crooks enter the scene stealing the car discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else but after stumbling upon a note which reads Please love and care for this orphan child he decides to raise the child himself Five years pass The kid whose name is believed to be John now Charlies adopted son and sidekick start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money As for the kids mother shes become a star of great prominence devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts where lives the kid The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions unaware of each others identities When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention a middleaged country doctor having discovered Charlie not the boys true father sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child awayTHE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product especially for a silent movie made so long ago Chaplin who constructs his gags to perfection has one difficult scene that comes off naturally this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as hes lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot a substitute for a baby bottle back into his mouth Another classic moment on a serious nature is when Charlie is being held back by authorities being forced to watch his crying son taken away from him Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as hes being chased by a policeman from the slanted rooftops The closeup where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on filmChaplin and little Jackie billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin right down to his baggy pants Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances is so convincing that it doesnt take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp From this point onward he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor at the same time adding more plot pathos and truly great comedy routinesAs much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that followsTHE KID which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years was resurrected in the s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in  It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in  as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection double billed along with a comedy short THE IDLE CLASS  In the DVD format the two disc set includes rare outtakes and deleted scenes Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library where it made its debut December   during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights hosted by Robert Osborne and later in March  when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its Star of the MonthFor its age THE KID holds up extremely well thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan Theres no doubt Jackie Coogan  became an overnight star with this one film He was a natural While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again on screen anyway without them there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID ****,10
700,tt0012349,The Kid is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplins oeuvre Chaplin hadnt filled a film so fully with pathos since The Vagabond  and then it was in a very limited way subject to the confines of tworeel length Additionally Sunnyside  was a failure The feature length of The Kid also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags pranks and set pieces and with the support of Jackie Coogan its one of his funniest comediesThe parentchild relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment and for me not many have neared Chaplin in exploiting that formula in The Kid The sequence where they take the kid for a workhouse away from the tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the filmor of all film In addition to Chaplin and Coogan Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture Furthermore Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totherohs photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist but the musical score added to the  release composed by Chaplin taken from Tchaikovsky gives the sentimental parts its most verveOf the slapstick one of my favorite scenes involves the tramp in fear of a bully Its reminiscent of his Mutual short Easy Street  which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film Yet The Kid is much more than that which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplins previous work This was the beginning of the tramp as the sympathetic pitiful hero as well as clown thats so recognizable and beloved to this dayMoreover the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect Its also funny in a silly way Its somewhat analogous to the outer reality story although with much ambiguity I wasnt always sure Chaplin was making any clear point such as with the Christ image earlier in the film but that seems unimportant; The Kid affects the emotions and isnt especially aimed at engaging the mind At six reels with more sets and a developed plot this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplins previous films; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth thus making The Kid Chaplins first complete feature,9
701,tt0012349,It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as The Kid It is a silent movie but so rich winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words Chaplin and year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness And I really never cry in movies And the musicits simply Oscarlevel! The movie is sympathetic full of feeling touchingly funny moments It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over  years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age don´t miss it,10
702,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous His character the Tramp is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early th century but something all of us can overcomeIn one of his first roles with this character he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family Taking himself and this very talented young boy Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote directed starred in and composed the score for this filmHere Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own He hasnt got much but he does have love which is more than can be said for the childs motherFlash forward five years and now the mother wants her son back Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion Even so the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks things not used much at the time in the movies Using these little tricks and ideas Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the storyHowever at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh sometimes in the same scene This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it,8
703,tt0012349,Is there a way to name the greatest filmmaker of all time? Probably not to different people its gonna be different person so I can speak only for myself Let me try to describe my favorite contestant for this award,0
704,tt0012349,Its easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius but Ill say it once again the man was a genius if only at doing a certain particular kind of film You wouldnt ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film or at least one like out of Germany or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the s and s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and the usual kickedaround word manipulated amid the comedic setups Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the KidAs it stands even at  minutes which was trimmed by Chaplin himself  years after its original release and including a new musical score its just about a perfectly told tale It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that Dreamland sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful lightanddark examination of all the major characters in the picture now with angel wings and devil horns! What its about in complete basics is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she wont be able to take care of him and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at and the Tramp decides to take care of him he even names him in one amusing aside John Then it cuts to  years later and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows eat lots of pancake and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an Older Brother of a kid John gets in a fight with Meanwhile the mother is now a success not knowing her child is somewhere right in front of her noseThis may sound like a bit of story but its told briskly and without a missed beat in editing and Chaplins reedit tightens it to a point where were mostly with the Kid and the Tramp Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be playful absurd cute and bittersweet to a degree We know this cant exactly last but the moment the poor maybesick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic and yet partially triumphant sequences in the movies Its in a case like this where we as the audience tear up more or less as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out and then intercut with Chaplins daring dash across the rooftops to save him that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film silent or otherwise; that its silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true even a beat with the Kid playing with toys an obviously cute bit is great and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like ChaplinFeaturing some excellent setpieces just unto themselves aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that bellylaugh part with the repetitive brickhit to the head or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin and excellent performances from all supporting cast including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance its altogether an aweinspiring feat To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness,10
705,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid the cute little Jackie Coogan has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos and true to what you would expect of his best work does it superbly  The tramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding a little boy to the mix was the finishing touch  Look out too for little Lita Grey in the angel sequence who would become Chaplins nd wife four years after this film was made,0
706,tt0012349,What makes a feature film different to a short? It isnt just length After all some of Charlie Chaplins later shorts were as long as fortyfive minutes while The Kid is barely an hour No when Chaplin made his graduation to fulllength features he also strove to broaden the scope scale and above all the dignity of his work The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplins careerThe Kid begins with a bit of backstory as a few of Chaplins shorts do but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this Here we have the opening of a drama and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief Of course such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short but here that wouldnt be appropriate Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laughoutloud funny but they certainly dont belong in a straight dramatic setting And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room sceneAnd never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration but still very natural by the standards of the time And of course little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive his movements expressions and timings all spoton so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness and he appears more like a human cartoon character Coogan steals the picture with ease and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously asideThis too is an important difference with The Kid Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act famously severing his partnership with the funnyinhisownright Ben Turpin back in  Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own The few examples such as the routine with the policemans wife and the window ledge are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material However he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this outToday The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful featurelength spinoff If you look at something like the minute Christmas special of The Office it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode Chaplins full length features however were far more than just spinoffs and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work,9
707,tt0012349,The Kid became a critically hailed international hit A tramp Charles Chaplin brings up an abandoned baby Jackie Coogan and later loses him to his mother Edna Purviance; but there is a happy endingThe film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums The comedy is sparingly laid on but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest The production is comparatively smooth young Coogan is sensational and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced His inspiration it is suggested was the death of his own first son Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in ,10
708,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins first full length feature film and his biggest success up to that date is a remarkably heartwarming story  which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy It begins with a woman whos sin was motherhood who gives birth to a baby she cant support at a Charity Hospital which is kept padlocked from the inside She is forced to abandon it in an alley and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film as he is casually strolling by and then through a series of odd but entirely believable situations he is unable to get rid of it It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin who was in top form playing the little boy at  years old Charlies life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplins traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed dramatic story The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments sometimes simultaneously if you can believe that but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival and it is never once predictable all the way until the last frameThere is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy and in between rounds  Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well and giving him hints for the rest of the fight Meanwhile the other kids brother shows up a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankensteins monster than anything else What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street This is a slapstick setup that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time were it not for its direct relevance to the storyAt another point there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home as the  version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackies arms I think this is the only time in any film that Ive ever seen genuine lowbrow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident This combination not just here but throughout the film is The Kids biggest achievement There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about although my understanding is that volumes have been written about its symbolic meaning both within the movie and in reference to Chaplins personal life And speaking of which supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing I dont know which story to believe that it was because of Chaplins painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary I would bet its a little of both but the film is here and I guess ultimately thats all that matters In the five or six times that Ive seen The Kid I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramps real son either on screen or off Then again I am looking at it with st century eyes Some of Shirley Temples early films are also a little disturbing to me although for not quite the same reasons By this time Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films and after  short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond along with a few assorted others Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema,10

710,tt0012349,The simple lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch Id say that it is as much funny as sad and the music score couldnt be more accuratePerhaps the most delightful surprise was to In the dreamland scene So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated the scene made me question myself if at the moment I was watching Buñuel and not Chaplin It is not my Chaplins favorite but its for sure one of his bests Totally recommend to be watched Chaplin will never disappoint you thats for sure If you watch this one also with City Lights and Modern Times youll be ready to enjoy his talkies The Great Dictator a classic and the perfect touching till tears Limelight,9
711,tt0012349,Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five yearsIn reading Charlie Chaplins memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him The second thing was Chaplins determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be doneThe success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they dont totally steal the film from youThe Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid Hes the same rapscallion Tramp we all know but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp one of deep feeling and protectiveness Two people who need and love each other very much This film couldnt missFirst National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin the studio and his estranged wife Mildred Harris The Robert Downey Jr biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itselfTill that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid,9
712,tt0012349,The Kid was released in  at the pinnacle of the Silent era when emotions came to screen through looks and body language when we didnt need dialog we had faces And if theres one film where Charlie Chaplins face oddly illuminates the screen its definitely The Kid Sure many fans would argue that City Lights is Chaplins masterpiece but something is too perfect too masterfully directed it was made during the talking era Chaplin was in his s and had more experience while The Kid features a more youthful director It belongs to a whole other era and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed in  Chaplin was  Hitchcock  Brando wasnt even born discovering The Kid is like turning the pages of a dusty yellowpaged historical book one eye is watching the film while the other discovers a period And I dont know if Im the only one but theres something in the setting the location that makes the film look even older For all I saw the movie could have been set in the early century and considering the timing of the film maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin himself The film was made in a difficult personal time when hed just lost his son after his birth There was a great wound in Chaplins heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragementThe context of The Kid is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time which is even more impressive considering his sevenyear experience a short time but enough to create an icon the Little Tramp an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema Chaplins story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and Im sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame  and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a filmmakerThe Emigrant in  was like the first step back into Chaplins past inspired by his own experience The movie doesnt feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future and leaving the motherland wasnt synonym of sadness but the emotions were there beyond the slapstick and the comedy and waiting for another step back to finally explode in an emotional firework which directly transports us to Chaplins past He who grew up without a father and started working at an early age he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living before it cemented his talent he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin And this is how The Kid was made and for the first time Chaplin would become more than a simple clown and get all the respect he needed from his peers as a gifted filmmaker He could finally make his first masterpiece The Gold Rush but The Kid was this necessary last breath before taking the big diveMany aspects of The Kid highlight Chaplins past and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs  a woman abandons a child expecting him to be adopted by a rich family until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramps arms But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who despite the archetypal situations didnt make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt as is the father a nicelooking fellow and a sign that Chaplin doesnt hold any grief against his father These things happen and we shouldnt feel sorry as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos  the Tramp and the KidIn every aspect the Kid is Chaplins alter ego  hes smart tender funny sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing Weve seen so many child performances since  to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is and Jackie Coogan is one of the best if not the best almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy and that the kid didnt become as much a star as Chaplin is one of cinemas cruelest ironies The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense closeups on Chaplins face  his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen and whatever inhabits the Tramps heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himselfChaplin like Disney for animation handled drama with the same strength as for comedy the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy fun cheers and even some dreamy escapism allowing a selfreflexive approach of the magic of childhood The Kid is not perfect but its a masterpiece of sincerity of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music If not his best its his most defining film ,9
713,tt0012349,This is such a incredible movieAlong with City Lights and The Gold Rush this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin and it is also one of the best movies ever madeIt is true that for the modern viewers the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the boxofficeThat doesnt mean this movie isnt entertaining In fact I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny comedies and also way more emotional and engagingI truly loved this film It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldnt be forgotten,10
714,tt0012349,The opening title to this film reads A film with a smile  and perhaps a tear Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken for Charlie Chaplins The Kid has a plethora of smiles from start to finish and yes a few tears as well The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character played by Chaplin The Tramp takes the baby into his own care Five years go by and the Tramp and the Kid portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan are getting along just fine However a turn of events results in the two being separated and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his sonCharlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking and this film is one of his best His direction is truly remarkable being able to manipulate the audiences emotions so much without sound He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget He manages to make you laugh almost nonstop from start to finish and even wind up causing you to shed a tear Its so emotionally gripping and you just fall in love with these characters from the getgo Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinemaAs emotionally wrenching this film is its simply hilarious This film has some great slapstick humor and Chaplin is a true master of it Jackie Coogan is also great If I had to find one flaw with the film it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I dont really mind it despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film Overall The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute then tug at your heartstrings the next Its an absolute riot but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema Ive ever seen And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue its just incredible And not to mention the music is just stellar too Chaplin is a master at composition The Kid is one of my favorite films and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!,10
715,tt0012349,When watching this I wanted to give the film a  rather than an  simply because I do not think it is as good as Modern Times or one or two others However taking into account that this is  and the film technology is not all there I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done it could have been made a decade later and looked the sameChaplin has to of course be given a lot of credit for producing writing directing and starring Being a great comic actor is one thing but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid and they nailed it  hes adorable emotional and seems able to handle any situation,8
716,tt0012349,The worlds most famous tramp is back and this time he has kid sidekick! Sounds kind of gimmicky right? But it works perfectly! Chaplin and child actor Jackie Coogan work extremely well together Their scenes are filled with heart and you can see that they both enjoyed themselves during the making of the movie The movie has the signature Chaplin slapstick that is guaranteed to have you in stitches but it also has some genuinely sad and emotional moments making this movie one of Chaplins most fondly remembered from his gigantic and legendary filmography,10

718,tt0012349,I was hardly a Chaplin fan in fact I loved Laurel &amp; Hardy and really didnt like Charlie Chaplin until I found that I could impersonate him as a lookalike  Then while viewing his films for the need of impersonating I have become a big Charlie Chaplin fan  His comedy mingled with pasos and pantomime was unique and very funny; and this one is certainly one of his bestIn it a sixyear old Jackie Coogan makes his screen debut as a little orphan that the tramp picks up and cares for five years  Every moment of this film is terrific it moves along swiftly and made me shed a tear three or few times  Chaplins score is undeniably a great piece of artwork and the acting is superb; nobody in this film lacksespecially ChaplinI recommend this film for all to see  Its age has not diminished this little love tale for a family in fact it makes you realize family love even more  Youll laugh cry and have a great time out  Rent it  Buy it View it  Its a film for all to see,0
719,tt0012349,They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but Im not so sure anymore There has been a generational discontinuity at least in the USA that seems to have happened about  or  years ago I suspect that most people over the age of  could identify Charlie Chaplin and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinctionGenerally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation but Jackie Coogan is an exceptionSentimental manipulation there is but its mainly limited to one or two scenes The comedy is pretty acerbic Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again Thats not what passes for sentimentalityBesides Coogan is cute when hes  or  years old a ragamuffin dressed in floppy oversized bags of clothing so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it And the kid can act tooCharlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him which was all he had to do Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because hes too inexperienced to know how to overact Chaplain is good too of course How could one person be so inventive? Its said that TV eats up talent because of the constant demand for new material One of the better series Twilight Zone had about three good years of collaborative effort in it Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in  films and directed something like  of them and he was just getting startedIll give one example of a joke without an iota of sentiment in it to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid a big bully who knocks him about Chaplain spots this interrupts the fight and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing  go for the belly keep your guard up  and sends him back into the fight At this point the bullys hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says If your boy beats my boy Im going to beat you Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bullys chin and flattens him But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back Chaplain dashes over puts his foot on the Coogans chest to hold him down quickly counts to ten rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand  the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy Youll enjoy it Especially if youre one of those rare folks under  with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue,0
720,tt0012349,A picture with a smile and perhaps a tearThat is the first line of the movie as it begins and it stands true We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling Wow I cant say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story Now we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally recent great movie is Finding Nemo But whats special about this movie is simplicty honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into usDone by the genius Chaplin there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling we either smile or bring tears So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do are done there Winning over a fight from a neighbour meeting angels and all Now look at the editing in this less than an hour film its neat and precise The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film Acting is sublime by Chaplin only few can do what he did and even today hardly anyone can match him Its a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch atlas watch it before you die you may learn something you never wanted to miss Its / for one of the finest silent movies ever,10
721,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is one of Chaplins best films as well as one of his most famous It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by and its not hard to see why Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector a young miner during the gold rush After getting caught in a storm he hurries to the only shelter that he can find a wood cabin in the middle of the storm It turns out that it is already inhabited and by a tough criminal named Black Larson no less and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim another prospector insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film,10
722,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is pure gold  It was Charlie Chaplins third featurelength film and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris  which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp  This movie should be counted among Chaplins best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights which Ive also seen as THE best Chaplin movie but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedys immortal geniusesHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV I saw it again in October  as part of my colleges silentfilm class on a poorquality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen ,10
723,tt0015864,Charles Chaplins The Gold Rush is arguably his finest film He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich What he does not realize is that he may find love in the form of Georgia Hale instead of money In the end that may be all right with him The Gold Rush shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer writer and director he was Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the th Century Chaplin showed humanity love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career The movie is exceptional in every way Although I am not as wellversed with movies from the s as I am with the decades following it I would still probably call The Gold Rush the finest film of that year period Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today  stars out of ,0
724,tt0015864,The  Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious As an unnamed prospector Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner the dancing roles and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff His companion Big Jim McKay Mack Swain at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplins character to be a chicken and before long a bear enters their cabin In the midst of it all the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia Georgia HaleA real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!,10
725,tt0015864,To see Charlie Chaplins The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment One cannot help but enjoy a film as welldone as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered and I can see why It is a masterful blend of comedy drama and romance among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture Like all great movies The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramps flawless physical comedy He was a master of comedic timing and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians Ive ever seen Dont get me wrong this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler The film moves along at a brisk pace following the misadventures of our hero The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin of course as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska Along his journey through the elements the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen Tom Murray a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold Fortunately our friend also comes across a fellow prospector Big Jim McKay Mack Swain who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich But the Lone Prospectors adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere When he is forced back to civilization he falls in love with Georgia Georgia Hale the most beautiful girl in town Of course it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite the handsome ladys man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia as well Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the egomaniacal lady killer All of this would be too much for any one of us but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie I am a fan of Charlie Chaplins movies but as objective as I can possibly be this IS one of the great moviesEssential viewing!,10
726,tt0015864,This silent classic has many strong points  it has a lot of humor interesting characters a good story and good settings  Its the kind of film that shows how much a master filmmaker can communicate in a silent movie  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion but other than that its a fine filmChaplin himself plays the Lone Prospector and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors rickety cabins plus some other good materialThe version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin reedited in the s adding his own narration and deleting the title cards which gives it a slightly different feel  These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who arent used to silent films You can tell from Chaplins narration how fond he must have been of The Gold Rush and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art,0
727,tt0015864,Charlie Chaplins silent film also rereleased with a narration in the early s focuses as usual on the Little Tramp and in this case his attraction to a chorus girl Georgia Hale This is the one where he eats a boot along with its laces and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rollsThe role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin Lita Grey but her pregnancy ruled her out Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions Mack Swain appears as Big Jim who shares a cabin with the Tramp at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and goldrunners as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time as a sound film it is fairly good,8
728,tt0015864,Ive seen both version of this filmthe original silent version from  and the rerelease by Chaplin in the s The difference is that the rerelease was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies To do this title cards were removedhaving Chaplin narrate the film In addition Chaplincreated music for the most partsome were classical pieces sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVDit has both plus excellent DVD extras Otherwise there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out theremany with terrible quality prints or music or both The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the  rereleaseI use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film though I might in the future use it for my Psychology classes as well I teach both because Chaplins genius came from his obsessivecompulsive nature The movie reportedly had  times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than  takes!! The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century Along the way he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb Suffice to say the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch something not true of all fulllength slapstick comediessometimes their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to fulllengthThis is a gorgeous wellexecuted piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac The musical score arranged by Chaplin direction acting and cinematography all are simply perfectmaking this in my opinion the best fulllength silent comedy ever made This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keatons films!,10
729,tt0015864,If any single figure can fairly be said to symbolize the glory years of the silent filmsthe cinemas truly international epochit is Charles Chaplins indomitable tramp The Little Fellow as millions came to call him was at once tatty and debonair browbeaten and irrepressibly optimisticand he was without question the bestloved international star in all of film history His coat was too small his pants too large his mustache patently falseand the resultant silhouette instantly recognizable wherever movies were shown Charlie Chaplins tramp spoke to all walks of lifeand never more eloquently than in such silent films as The Kid and The Gold Rush The Gold Rush is superb It deals with Charlies adventures to win the affection of a local dancehall girl and his hilarious efforts to avoid being eaten by bears and by prospectors who are bigger and hungrier than he The most memorable scene is one in which he dines on an old shoe Chaplins exquisite grace turned the boiled shoe into a gourmet feast he carves it carefully smacks his lips in anticipation and then eats it with gusto and appreciation sucking the nails as if they contained the most juices and twirling the laces around his fork as if they were spaghetti,10
730,tt0015864,In Charles Chaplins  film The Gold Rush a lone prospector travels to California looking for gold and entwines himself in adventures and finds Georgia the woman of his dreams After many hardships including a relocating cabin the lone prospector played by Charles Chaplin finds gold and becomes rich ending in success and unity with Georgia The time period in which this movie was shot compared with the technological innovation and the state of the art filming techniques give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel The use of upclose shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a new feel to the style of silent cinema The scene with the cabin shifting and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin was one of the many stylistic filming techniques that gave The Gold Rush such artistic and ingenious appeal Chaplins ideas and his vision that he brought to life in the movie The Gold Rush make it a great landmark in the beginning of silent films and in film history The intricate but simple story of The Gold Rush brought about many distinct feelings when viewing It gives feelings of happiness during scenes where there is comedic relief and slapstick comedy and also can bring about sadness or pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Years but she never shows up It reveals how silent films can become in touch with a persons feelings making them feel for the protagonist without having to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot These aspects of The Gold Rush make it a milestone in the film industry of the modern world,9
731,tt0015864,One of the best Chaplin movies which means one of the best movies ever made Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as `Eating the shoe and `The Roll Dance Both the original version and the second release have their own charm,10

733,tt0015864,We follow the little fellow Chaplin in his trip to Alaska to find gold  which he ends up succeeding in finding love at the same time The first half of the movie reunites Chaplin another lonesome gold seeker and a moralless scoundrel in a shelter under a particularly horrendous snowstorm There happens one of the most memorable scene of the movie Big Jims delusion that Chaplins is a giant of course bearing Chaplins manners chicken and his desperate attempts to eat him; but Chaplin is saved by a bear showing up which they finally eat Then parting their ways begins the second half of the movie the onesided romance with the beautiful Georgia met in a dance hall How funny was the scene when she invited out of despair our little fellow to dance to avoid dancing with an invading Jake! How genius showed Chaplin to use TchaykovskysBeauy &amp; the Beasts waltz! Bringing to tear and laughters at the same time As Georgia plays nastily and mocks and fools Chaplin with her friends and secretly discovers his love her heart swings But Chaplin is taken away by his former colleague Big Jim to become millionaires ie find gold And they find it! All ends well as the little fellow &amp; big Jim now millionaires leave on a ship While dressed poorly as in his earlier gold seeker day for a photography he falls upon Georgia who indisputably is happy to be with him and even more happy to find him multimillionaires as she hears from the ship crew The moral?

734,tt0015864,All the best Chaplin films have one unique scene thats very memorable because its either very funny or very touching In this film its one of the funny onesYou see in this film Chaplin jumps on the band wagon to Alaska to participate in the Gold Rush Along the way he runs into some crazy characters and has to stay out in the middle of nowhere with one of them Since they must try to survive in the cold weather Chaplin decides to cook dinner What he cooks and how they eat it is the priceless joke that makes this film so greatIts not just that one joke though there are tons of laughs in this great movie So I highly recommend it for any fan of silent films or comedies Youll have a lot of fun watching itAs of now this is the earliest Charlie Chaplin film that Ive seen but it probably wont be for long I think hes one of the greatest directors and I hope to see more of his films soon,10
735,tt0015864,THE GOLD RUSH United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations So proud of his achievement Chaplin reissued this silent film in  with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself eliminating the use of title cards Then in the summer of  THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting stations week series of The Silent Years as hosted by Orson Welles from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William PerryTHE GOLD RUSH which is set in the turn of the century opens with The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin coming to Alaska A snow storm drives him into the cabin of Black Lawson Tom Murray an outlaw Big Jim McKay Mack Swain another prospector who has found gold on his claim is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin After much struggle Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests Stranded due to the heavy storm Larson finds himself chosen to go out for help While out in the storm he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him He gets away by stealing their dog sled but is later killed in an avalanche Back to the cabin Charlie and Larson almost in near starvation eventually make a meal out of a large bear When the snow storm finally subsides the two men go about their separate ways Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia Georgia Hale a dance hall girl causing jealousy from her suitor Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite As for Jim he has forgotten where his gold claim is and locates Charlie to help him find it separating him from Georgia The results that follow is classic ChaplinAside from a large list of supporting players which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis The Gold Rush contains many now classic comedy supplements including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlies encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement There are tender moments too including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Years Eve dinner with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for themWith THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplins most revived and discussed movie one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed including THE CIRCUS  CITY LIGHTS  MODERN TIMES  and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR  Since the advent of home video in the early s THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores ranging from the use of piano organ or orchestra There are even some editions that have no music track at all along with some copies running different time lengths and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout The  reissue being a shorter print with Chaplins narration not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics but can also be found on Chaplins th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a  comedy short PAY DAY Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection But in spite of numerous editions THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics  and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter  reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector avid lip readers will notice that he is called Charlie by his supporting players especially by Georgia ****,10
736,tt0015864,If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability t you a commend this film as well as City Lights  Modern Times isnt strictly speaking a silent film although Chaplin had no dialogue there  The Gold Rush while not Chaplins best film does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits it must be seen  Excellent film   version redone by Chaplin is a bit better but either will do  Most highly recommended,10
737,tt0015864,To be perfectly honest I wish I could denounce Chaplin more fervently than I find myself able to Right down to my fundamental worldview I am a Buster Keaton person the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness The world as I understand it just doesnt work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay So wishing it did only fosters more painThis is actually worst than The Kid in this respect Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold Oh though filthy rich at that point when in the end he falls practically in the girls arms he is again dressed like a tramp  meaning no doubt he is still the same person  but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul here he gets both There is not even the thought of a compromiseYet I cant help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplins cosmology; the mysterious elusive fates  seemingly random but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose  that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocksNowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside the reality thought to be known understood domesticated into order but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void So every step inside taken casually without much thought is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death Blissful ignorance the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabinIt is a powerful cosmologic symbol what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life With both gold and love impossible love with the dream girl as the chimeras that trick the mindSo Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside but either cannot properly understand – and confuses karma for providential fate  or he does is terrified and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy taleSo however wellmeant its a dishonest patronizing vision of bliss Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging but eventually benevolent whims of providence Its all made right again more than rightNotice how well integrated is this notion inside the film proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the pointofview of the tramp who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger souldefining mechanisms that shape his life that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lessonSo instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill just wait and itll all work out in the end It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the filmSure it is occasionally very funny inventive But were talking here about the more intricate mechanisms that drive a film  and film aspiring to be a truthful reflection of life life itself,0
738,tt0015864,This is the first silent film I have ever seen so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound other than the piano in the background in a  minute movie So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas acrossI felt like they did some of same gags over and over again like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove It just got really old to me quickly I dont know maybe because Im from a different time period and way life but the film just didnt do anything for me I didnt really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only  to  minutes long and nothing would have been lost,3
739,tt0015864,Make them laugh make them laugh The American comic tradition and American movies were made for each other Gold Rush is one example that Charlie Chaplin was the father of American comedy Even though Chaplin loves to press political economical or social messages in his films The Gold Rush remains true to its genre It is a comedy non the less Even at the end of the film when THE TRAMP receives a kiss Chaplin reminds the audience that she has ruined the picture with the kiss This is suppose to be a comedy!,9
740,tt0015864,Spoilers hereinI consider `City Lights to be a masterwork one of the films that every literate person must see This film is often equally celebrated but it seems to be a random collection of integrated ideas to me Some work most dontThe  rescore and voiceover is much tighter visually but sonicly heavy If you have a chance with the DVD see it in the  recut with no sound and subtitlesThe one skit that works the best is the famous dancing rolls bit You really must see three versions of this one after another Look at the original Then see the Robert Downey Jr version done in  almost  years later Notice how much more comic Downeys is because he uses a different timing and is both doing it and referencing the Chaplin dance Then see the Johnny Depp version of the year later which pokes fun at the Downey version and reannotates the original A work of genius overlain on a masterpieceOtherwise there are better silent comedies to see And better ChaplinTeds Evaluation   of  Has some interesting elements,0
741,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is a showcase of sorts for Chaplin In it he provides audiences with a wide range of cinematic elements from his signature slapstick routines to dramatic relationships The rags to riches plot was interesting and witty but felt dragged out While Chaplin is good at emotionally engaging the audience with relateable situations like getting stood up or competing for a woman the lack of serious conflict makes the film seem simple The special effects were handled nicely even by todays standards but the true enjoyment in the film comes from watching the tramp endure hardship as he accidentally progresses into wealthiness and sees his life fall together by favorable coincidence,6
742,tt0015864,Spoiler AlertThe Gold Rush is perhaps one of the best silent movies I have ever seenAlthough it takes a bit to get used to silent movie language youll be rewarded with a marvelousfunny and poignant movieSome of the scenes are hilarious and some really touches your heartstrings Chaplin as performer gives one of his best performances in this movie There are plenty of great scenesChaplin and Mack Swain in the cabincrazy with hunger and cabin feverthe touching New Years Eve party and finally the hilarious finale with the cabin out on the edge of a cliffThe later version which was released with added narration and music wasnt as good as the originalbut easier for modern audiences to watch,8
743,tt0015864,What a delightful film I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them like the eating shoe scene fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Years Eve knowing that he was stoodup I genuinely felt for him Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time Brilliant,10
744,tt0015864,The primitive production values the decrepitlooking camera work and the silent soundtrack with only musical scores to suffice for the lack of the talkie in that era does little to ruin the viewers chance of being entertained by this highly enjoyable classic masterpiece by Charlie Chaplin The Little Tramp finds himself in the Yukon braving the wintery elements bears and a psychopath all for the sake of claiming his own fortune of gold Under his expert direction Chaplin guides THE GOLD RUSH with painstaking detail of what life would be like to live in the freezing extremes having to shack up in a  cabin in danger of toppling over a snowcapped cliff and feasting on shoes for protein Amidst all the atrocities Chaplin being that likeable underdog that everybody roots for and loves overcomes the odds managing to make the best out of a bad read terrible situation He even takes the time to humor himself and a few ladies with a songanddance number involving two forks and a pair of potatoes,0
745,tt0015864,The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights?  There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator  There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramps world City Lights falls short  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what Charlot has been all about all along It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplins works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime  out of ,10
746,tt0017136,Technically speaking I have seen this Fritz Lang silent scifi before but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the s The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable apocalyptic fantasy and religious allegory It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers who toil in the depths tending the machines and the upper classes who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers The hero the idle pampered son of the citys supervisor Joh Fredersen changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria the Madonna of the workers His father meanwhile is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didnt see In addition to restoring scenes to the film the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version With these changes the story becomes much clearer particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis Perhaps most importantly a whole new subplot is added involving the heros dead mother Hel who was loved by both his father and Rotwang With this clarification of the backstory the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer In some ways it recalls the family backstory of the Star Wars movies Of course the real strength of Metropolis isnt the story which is pretty silly and probably wouldnt have worked in anything but a silent film but its amazing visuals which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to  and Blade Runner Actually though in most respects silent films now look primitive one area in which they have the edge over modern filmmaking is in their frequently grandiose production design Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world The models of the citys towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a s film Even beyond the expansive production design and for the time special effects Langs visuals are all consistently inventive The robot Maria provides some of the movies most iconic images including her transformation into a human being In a later scene she performs for upperclass men in a nightclub and as she performs a striptease that in s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs A sign of Langs visual lavishness and the studios that he doesnt hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a characters state of mind For instance when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idols head into which the workers are being sacrificed At another point while hes sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs labor parable and Lang gives us spectacular images of the towers construction and fall In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and overliteral but theyre what silent cinema does best tell a story without the advantage or obstacle of dialogue The story is a little slow to start but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that Ive seen In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films as the workers riot and sabotage the machines endangering the entire city Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than  years,9

Sure some science fiction movies are huge today such as George Lucas latest goofy Star Wars movie but in  Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then And sure enough we went right ahead living the way we were living the population got bigger and more crowded and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society Metropolis was run by his father John Frederson the master of Metropolis He lives in a Pleasure Garden high above the level of the workers and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father given the terrible conditions under which they live and work Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic sinister looking machine The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devillooking monster  After countless workers are consumed by it no wonder this was Hitlers favorite film they are immediately replaced by other workers who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements If some of these scenes men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured and the rest of the workers keep right on working hardly even noticingThe way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated `Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups is a saying that doesnt necessarily only apply to stupid people as Metropolis suggests Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue and the result is still compelling today The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways except that the two films can hardly be compared  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least An excellent film Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten,10
748,tt0017136,I doubt that Id ever seen anything resembling a complete version of METROPOLIS before though certain of its scenes were familiar to me if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keatons HEAVEN   In any case whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration  I expected to be distracted by the restorations technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it  As exaggerated as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards some performances such as the Master of the city are amazingly nuanced and layered and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone The meticulous design of the film the unerring camera placement and Langs muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking Id thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity important = dull but now Ive come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been,10
749,tt0017136,Fritz Langs Metropolis is the first true masterpiece of science fiction in film You can see its influence in films such as Star Wars The Matrix Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Blade Runner and countless others Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were in some cases phenomenal I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is  years old because a lot has happened in film since then Yet if you look at the basic elements of this movie  its story characters artwork cinematography etc I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late s Also take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this The performances and set designs are going to be over the top That was part of the style Metropolis may not be for everyone but for those willing to read between the lines this film still has a lot to offer!,8
750,tt0017136,In the future the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes the workers who live in the underground below the machines level and the dominant classes that lives on the surface The workers are controlled by their leader Maria Brigitte Helm who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles Maria meets Freder Fredersen Gustav Fröhlich the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen Alfred Abel in a meeting of the workers and they fall in love for each other Meanwhile Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate themMetropolis is a fantastic futuristic view of the fight of classes When Metropolis was shot it was a romantic revolutionary period of mankind history with socialist movements around the world Fritz Lang directed and wrote the screenplay of this masterpiece certainly inspired in this historical moment and defending a position of agreement and understanding between both sides showing that they need each other I wonder how this great director was able to produce such special effects in  with very primitive cameras and equipment The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art My vote is tenTitle Brazil MetropolisNote On  March  I saw this film again on BluRay,10
751,tt0017136,Metropolis is surely one of the greatest films ever made  Its scope its reach its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by todays standards of filmmaking  Seen in context of its premier in  Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history  Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great and in particular Metropolis  A great film is one that stirs the imagination leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life and achieves a kind of immortality  Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria  Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings halluciatory scenes and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions  There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria  Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups  Lastly Metropolis has stood the test of time  It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre  The story itself is simplea Biblical allegory about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen  The film is anything but simple  It is immense and a rich legacy that director Fritz Lang has left us,0
752,tt0017136,I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie This is without a doubt the best scifi movie Ive ever seen! Let me explain my position We have all seen modern scifi movies and argued over which is the best ever made but those film makers have high speed film and computers Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in  and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must see for all persons interested in the history of film as well as just good fun for everyone The social metaphores as well as the religious and philosophical double meanings are a sight to behold,10
753,tt0017136,This must be one of the greatest movies of all time I found myself almost in a state of shock during the whole movie Everything was perfect The story was great the filming was pure genius and the effects directly from another dimensionI dont think any movie after this one have gotten so much out of the available effects of the time as this one Nowadays they have super computers generating special effects Sure they look good but its no big deal making them Back in  computers werent even invented yet all effects had to be done by hand or in simple editing And when you take a look at all the thins that have been done in this movie its impossible not to get impressed Huge buildings explosions flooding picture phones however did he come up with the very idea? transformation sequences robots and so on No movie has ever pulled the limits of special effects as much as this one Star Wars and Jurassic Park are also known as limit pullers in special effects but they dont even come closeThen you have the filming Everything is perfect The use of body language is tremendous the light setting perfect everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera Ive never been witness to such a treat in filming other placesAnd the story!!! Perfect in every detail Intriguing exciting and thrilling with lots of religious undertones and tyranic leaders No wonder Hitler liked this movieI dont know how the original music of the film was but the new music for the restored  minute version I saw was really good and moodsetingAll in all This is one of the most perfect movies of all time and it deserves anything it can get Never has a / been as secure as for this movie,10
754,tt0017136,Silent movies are not for everyone Neither are subtitles Those brave enough to view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between should definitely enjoy this silent masterpiece One of the biggest productions of its time Metropolis still holds its own when set design and special effects are compared But what Metropolis really has is orginality This GermanExpressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future modern city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern scifi Star Warss CPO was based on Bridgette Helms robot Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis lookalike cities This is a very good movie Its too bad most movies dont have its originality,9
755,tt0017136,Fritz Langs groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema How can a movie thatll soon turn  years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages The world has been divided into two main categories thinkers &amp; workers! If you belong to the first category you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if youre a worker your life isnt worth a penny and youre doomed to perilous labor underground The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself Its essential viewing anyway! Metropolis is a very demanding filmexperience and definitely not always entertaining But as it is often the case with silentcinema classics the respect and admiration youll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoymentaspect Fritz brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to recreate a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines Many supposedly restored versions have been released over the years in  and  for example but the version is still the finest in my opinion even though that one already isnt as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it Metropolis perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made  A Space Odyssey Star Wars and Blade Runner owe their existence or at least their power to it,8
756,tt0017136,Metropolis is my alltime favourite movie so Ive saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb Ive enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies Ive seen but now Im moving on to other passionsAlthough written by Fritz Langs wife Thea von Harbou Metropolis was originally Langs idea he was inspired by the sight of New Yorks skyscrapers when he sailed to America in  During his American trip he visited the set of The Phantom of the Opera and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasnt filmedDespite its epic power Metropolis makes very little sense The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen so why is the one named Freder*sen* the father not son of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwangs crude little cottage the only preFredersen building that wasnt demolished during the construction of this city? Von Harbous very long and unwieldy novelisation of her script establishes this fact but never explains it How and why did Rotwangs hightech laboratory manage to get constructed BENEATH that cottage without disturbing it?For modern viewers some of the plots incoherence can be blamed on missing footage particularly in American prints The distributors for this films original Stateside release commissioned playwright Channing Pollock to translate the German titles A major subplot of the backstory features a deceased woman named Hel who was married to Rotwang but left him to marry Fredersen and give birth to Freder This unseen womans name could not easily be changed for the American version due to a couple of shots of her memorial engraved with the Teutonic name HEL Apparently Pollock feared that American viewers would be offended by this words similarity to Hell so he simply excised the entire subplot from this long movieThe reallife drama on the set of Metropolis mustve been quite interesting in itself Mad scientist Rotwang alias Doctor Strangeglove is played by actor Rudolf KleinRogge who had been married to scenarist von Harbou before she left him to marry Fritz Lang the mastermind of this film In Metropolis Rotwangs wife left him to marry the master of Metropolis Id love to know how KleinRogge felt about the fact that his reallife marital and sexual situation was the inspiration for key plot elements of this movie  and I wonder how KleinRogge felt about knowing that the entire cast and crew knew this as wellMost astonishing about this gargantuan production is the fact that nearly all of Metropolis was actually built to scale with just a couple of miniaturesTrivia tidbit actress Brigitte Helm was cast in the dual female role largely because she was flatchested and therefore she could easily fit inside the mechanical suit for the Robotrix A more busty actress would have suffered constant discomfort inside those galvanised bosoms of the metal costume I learnt this more than  years ago from an eldery Austrian stagehand who worked on the filmFor all its flaws Metropolis will always be my favourite movie Ive enjoyed writing all these reviews for IMDb The joy of posting my reviews on this site has brought me many friendships and a few enemies Well you cant win em allNitrate film stock doesnt last forever and all good things come to a happy ending This is my last review here Ill keep watching movies but other passions are important to me as well Thank you IMDb and thank you to everyone who has read my reviews I will happily rate Metropolis a full  out of ,10
757,tt0017136,One definitely cant fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Langs vision even if as always with depictions of the future there are a few forgivable blind spots The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the s as are the flyingmachines that buzz about them; while the business dress of tomorrows rulers unlike their exotic leisure wear doesnt appear to have advanced one iota!HGWells criticised the film for its adherence to arty image over scientific rigour and as a piece of coherent science fiction its certainly as lacking as he claimed The machines exist to appear awesome and to torment their workers rather than to perform any apparent task and there is no explanation of how this society functions how it evolved or how it is sustained let alone of the incongruities that must surely lie behind such anomalous locations as the catacombs and the cathedral But Wells own futuristic film Things to Come conceived in direct riposte to Langs unscientific approach is tedious and talky as a result didactic in its heavyfooted philosophy and explanations and lacking in artistic vision Metropolis may be soft SF but its approach undoubtedly makes for better cinemaI am not however impressed by it as a film Masterpiece of Modernism it may be  but great design and special effects cant save todays bigbudget clunkers from deficiencies of character and plot and they dont save this one Ironically I suspect that its reputation has benefited greatly from its being the only silent film many of its viewers have ever encountered reading through the IMDb pages I see wellmeaning comments like Great  when you consider how primitive cinema was in  and once you get used to the fact that it takes about ten gestures to convey one sentence It wasnt  and it doesnt!As silent films go this is in many places agonizingly slow and repetitious marred by clumsy acting tendentious titles and overwrought gestures By the late s cinema had progressed far beyond this laboured pantomime in Langs case the heavy stylisation may have been a deliberate choice but compared to the fluidity of contemporaries such as Sjostroms The Wind or The Scarlet Letter Asquiths Underground or Shooting Stars and Murnaus Sunrise the film comes across as ten years behind the times The problem is not necessarily with the actors  Brigitte Helm as has been observed does an excellent job in differentiating her two characters  but with the direction and pacingWe saw the restored version with the original Gottfried Huppertz score; the latter didnt always seem to fit too well with pops jumps and awkward silences but this was I assume due either to the difficulty of fitting it to allow for the missing material or to problems in the projection booth when running a newlyarrived print for the first time However the painstaking summary of the various missing scenes only ended up increasing my appreciation of what a good job had been done in the editingdown in the first place! To take a single example where the edited version conveys Freders sudden recollection that he is supposed to be the workers longawaited mediator via the simple juxtaposition of three shots  the shiftchange whistle announcing the meeting the catacombs and Freder suddenly struck by an idea and rushing off  the restoration betrays the fact that a couple of scenes of mimed dialogue were originally provided to spell out the message at painstaking lengthIt is interesting to see how it was done but most of the cuts are either an improvement or a very clever abridgement and by and large I didnt feel that what was omitted had been any great loss In fact frankly I felt that the film was in need of further editing at certain points such as Rotwangs pursuit of Maria through the catacombs She screams and runs and screams and runs and is pursued by a searchlight effect; its clever selfconsciously clever the first couple of times but the repetition becomes tedious to the point of caricature Plot infelicities abound in increasing numbers culminating in the infamous Hunchback of Notre Damestyle ending where the mad scientist carries off the girl across the roof of the cathedral hotly pursued by Our Hero which raised giggles in a hitherto serious and respectful audience with which I couldnt help but sympathiseThis is a film to see once in a lifetime so that you can say that you have seen it  not least because most of the impact lies in the visuals But its all surface and no substance the characters act arbitrarily the plot is subservient to the Message the pacing is like treacle the storytelling technique is primitive and really all it has going for it is the visual flair and the special effects I quite honestly believe that this work would be better appreciated as a set of stills in a glossy brochure; an exhibit in a design exhibition This is not cinema as I love it  its innovative it may be Art but as an actual film its only a poor shadow,6
758,tt0017136,There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator This is the predominant theme of Metropolis and director Fritz Lang finds numerous ways to say and visualize his message during the course of the film The movie relies on repeated visual imagery to make its point and does so effectively even if tedious at times Particularly effective is the representation of the worker society as an almost single living unit moving trance like to their appointed time and task The use of a ten hour clock in the workers chamber constantly draws our attention as does the hangdog posture of the individual slaves who grind out their workday as if in a dazeAmid this rabble worker Maria Brigitte Helm is the inspirational voice of the workers offering hope for a brighter future by a mediator yet to appear However the Master of Metropolis John Frederson Alfred Abel sees in her a way to quell the underlying frustration of the workers commissioning his scientist Rotwang to create a robot Maria to plant discord among the workers Rotwangs laboratory would have done Frankenstein proud and the creation of the robot is a marvel of cinematic imagery The robot Marias belly dance transforms into a scene of such raw energy and sexual awareness that it awakens the statues of the Seven Deadly Sins one of the master strokes of this expressionist filmSo much imagery in fact is layered into Metropolis that its safe to say that repeat viewings will lead to even more interpretations of its vision and not simply for its denunciation of a class society Both timely and timeless the film captures a dynamism that inspires passion even after nearly eighty years following its original release,8
759,tt0017136,I really hate it when I dont enjoy a classic film I really want to enjoy it but I just cant I want to understand some peoples love for it but I just cant Metropolis falls under this category An unbearably slow film I watched the restoration which is over  hours longthat may have been a bad idea that starts off with interesting ideas but then seems to not really do much with them It is the year  the wealthy rule the city of Metropolis while the lowerclass work for hours on end underground in awful conditions The Master of Metropolis is Joh Fredersen Alfred Abel and his son is Freder Gustav Frohlich who spends his days with other rich people in a place called the pleasure garden where he truly does nothing at all A woman named Maria Brigitte Helm brings a group of working children up for a visit in pleasure garden and Freder is quickly enamored by Maria Freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shocked as an explosion goes off and kills multiple workers He reports this to his father who is disappointed his son was the first to report it over his assistant Josepha Theodor Loos and his assistant is quickly fired This does an immediate job of showing the coldness of Joh but they never do much else with his character In fact very little of the characters are developed in anyway Most of them are completely uninteresting and the setting itself is compelling at first but quickly loses anything interesting halfway through the film as the film moves at a snail pace Anyways the main aspect of the plot here is that the workers are led by Maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of a mediator to make it happen My real issue is that the film starts with such a great idea and had potential to become something like  Im aware it came out afterwords and that its a novel but still just an example but it instead becomes filled with strange religious allusions and becomes a witch hunt essentially by the end They never really do any decent social commentary at all If any at all This wouldnt matter if the film was actually entertaining but it only is in spurts and then quickly becomes a repetitive bore I do think the special effects were impressive and this film is obviously important for being the first full length science fiction filmwell ever That doesnt mean it holds up because it doesnt In fact itd be hard for me to believe the film was entertaining in  I still wonder if I had watched the shorter version of the film how much more I wouldve enjoyed the film It certainly wouldve have been paced better considering so much of this film is unbelievably uninteresting But I dont think that changes the fact that this movie doesnt really do anything It isnt entertaining It doesnt really have a message What is this movie? I guess good special effects for ? Whatever Im glad I gave this classic a chance but I highly doubt Ill revisit it anytime soon,4
760,tt0017136,This review contains Spoilers But since the story is by far the least reason to watch Metropolis feel free to still read it even if you havent watched it yetMetropolis is a film that was far ahead of its time It influenced a great lot of sciencefiction films and how The Blade Runner Batman or Dark City would look like if there wasnt Metropolis  who knows Even The Matrix Reloaded is heavily inspired by this classic that is as old as my grandmother Now what is it all about? About Freder the son of the head of the city of Metropolis a Christlike figure who falls in love with the preacher of the working class a saintlike woman who happens to be named Maria When a robot who is modeled to look like Maria makes the workers almost extinguish their city and their children Maria and Freder save the children and in the end Freder makes his father and the workers cooperate for a brighter futureSounds silly to you? Yes and thats exactly what the story is silly Thats also the reason why still today Metropolis isnt accepted as the masterpiece it is by a few film buffs But these people dont understand one thing A good film does more than only tell a story A film can be great even without a story at all and a silly story combined with amazing visuals can make you forget all the other weaknesses a film has And wow what amazing images Metropolis offers What an art direction! What wonderful special effects! And remember as I already said this film is as old as my grandmother! Just have a look at the workers They hardly ever seem to be individuals In the mass scenes they look like one big creature moving forward or backwards When they are working they look more like machines than like human beings whereas the machines resemble monsters more than they do technical devices best seen in the moments when Freder hallucinates and sees the big machine as a workereating Moloch We also see a worker and later Freder work on a machine that looks like a clock with  blinking light bulbs doing some that looks as exhausting as it looks senseless Or think of Rotwang the mad inventor who lives in a little hut that looks in this film like it was from another world He has a black prosthesis for his right hand its not a coincidence that Stanley Kubrick gave his mad scientist/inventor Dr Strangelove a prosthesis for his right hand too He builds the robot that he makes to look like Maria and that transformation scene is one of the most magnificent scenes ever and looks more convincing than some scenes of modern scifi flicks I also have to mention Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and the robot  and the look in her eyes would already be enough to tell which of her characters is on screen at the moment If something like awards already would have been given in the s she sure would have walked home with quite a bunch of them And just look at her sexy dance! It is just as memorable as the shot of the many eyes watching her dance  or the many faces watching her preach just a few minutes later Metropolis is a film no scififan should miss I had the good luck that my first viewing of Metropolis one year ago was in a cinema when it was a rereleased after its restoration I can only recommend you to watch it in a cinema if you have the possibility to as Metropolis is just as   A Space Odyssey one of those rare films that are masterpieces on your TV set but a revelation on the big screen,10
761,tt0017136,I was very anxious to see Metropolis for the first time I had been into silent movies for a couple of years but hadnt had the opportunity to see Fritz Langs classic I finally saw it at a silent movie theater in Hollywood and my feelings were to say the least mixedThe film is visually stunning Monumental sets brilliantly directed scenes amazing special effects by the standards of the time In fact I might say that I was more enthralled by the visual effects of this movie than I was by say Lord of the Rings or Avatar Whereas Cameron and Jackson used CGI to make their visions come true; Lang had to use camera trickery paint and woodThis movie no doubt set the lexicon for the SciFi and blockbuster genre in stone The images of Metropolis have been repeated in innumerable movies The scene of the underground city being flooded has curious similarities to James Camerons Titanic Even the villainous Rotwang can be seen in the characters Dr Strangelove and Doc Brown from Back to the FutureBut then theres the story And the dialogue And the acting which is overwrought even by the standards of the time But I dont have enough room to go into thatStarting with the opening line LookThese are your brothers a violent cringe would run through my body every time the intertitles would appearThe later line about the head and hands needing the heart as mediator caused a huge outburst of laughter in the theater This serves as the basis for the moral of the story which was eerily similar to How the Grinch Stole Christmas Essentially it can boiled down to this Somebody according to writer Thea von Harbous later beliefs this turned out to be Adolf Hitler needs to appeal to the hearts of capitalist managers and tell them to be nice to their workers The outcome is a grudging handshake between the head manager Joh Frederson and the leader of the workers Grot; and thus begins a shining new day!Metropolis also incorporates religious symbolism which is to say the very least heavyhanded Scenes of the Seven Deadly Sins The Tower of Babel an altar to Moloch and the Flood all warn of doom to decadent societies that exploit the weak and kill the righteousIn the end this muddled mixture of Socialist calls for justice and Christian Apocalypticism creates a political message that Lang himself described as sillyI recommend this film for its artistic brilliance and groundbreaking techniques But dont go into this expecting an award quality filmIf you want to get into silent film this is a relatively easy one to get start with However I dont know if thats a good or a bad thing Ive met too many people whove said that Metropolis was the best silent movie theyve ever seen; which probably means that it was the only one that they ever bothered to watch I would recommend Sunrise or City Lights as a first over this,5
762,tt0017136,Francis Ford Coppola once said that Apocalypse Now wasnt just about Vietnam is was Vietnam In a similar way Metropolis isnt just about the Twentieth Century it is the Twentieth Century Almost every image in it reflects or more often predicts the realities of life in the West over the past hundred years in a way that is truly uncannyFrom small details  the traffic jams and blackouts that plague city dwellers  to major historical events  the climactic flood predicts every industrial disaster that has destroyed the lives of thousands of workers from Chernobyl to the Bhopal disaster whilst Fredersens vision of workers being fed to Moloch cant help but bring to mind the holocaust  Metropolis feels prescient in any number of ways In the image of the Manhattan skyline Lang really did find the perfect symbol of the coming century  progressive new faceless oppressiveThis is far from the simple Marxist fable it is often taken for  although the Socialist message can hardly be ignored Its also a Christian parable Maria flanked by crosses is counterbalanced by the Machine brought to life under a pentagram informed by the book of Revelation; a retelling of the Orpheus myth with Freder as Orpheus and Maria as Eurydice lost in the underworld; and a Kafkaesque nightmare of depersonalisation although the Gothic expressionistic production design is a long way from Kafkas more sterile styleIts also lest we forget a silly adventuremelodrama with a mad scientist an evil twin a bad father with a noble son and an impossibly virtuous idealised heroine In many ways it anticipates Star Wars in dressing up mythic standards with Science Fiction tropes  with Fredersen as the misguided King Freder as the handsome Prince Maria the goodhearted peasants daughter Rotwang as a scheming sorcerer and the Machine as the wicked witch appropriately burnt at the stake by the villagersThe MachineMan a confusing name for a construction so obviously feminine is the single most indelible image of the film; the scene in which Rotwang brings her to life for the first time is a real moment of magic and awe untarnished by eighty subsequent years of cinematic showmanship Even better is the scene in which she becomes a duplicate of Maria  such an obvious influence on James Whales Frankenstein that its hard not to shout out Its alive! The optical effects are years ahead of their time certainly the best of their kind until the sixties at least It also marks the beginning of Brigitte Helms truly extraordinary turn as the false MariaThis is only the third silent film Ive seen after Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and its taken me a while to acclimatise to the acting style which can seem close to parody What it really reminds me of however is modern dance which similarly seeks to communicate with the audience visually rather than verbally Metropolis encourages this comparison with the highly choreographed movements of the workers operating the machinery Bearing this in mind Helm is hugely impressive in multiple roles Maria could be a rather dull and virtuous heroine she enters the film surrounded by poor children in rags but Helm invests her with enormous energy and expressiveness It helps that the script allows her to take an unusually proactive role for a female character organising workers meetings and racing to the rescue of the endangered children However it is her performance as bad Maria vamping up a storm that lingers in the memory  the twitching jerking movements of her head and body the Anne Robinson style halfwink that changes the shape of her face that malicious little grin that makes it hard not to root for her mischief The entirely weird erotic dance that she performs isnt technically very good or erotic but it is utterly unforgettable Subtextually shes the Whore of BabylonThe other performances are mainly very good particularly Alfred Abel as Fredersen proving that it is possible to underplay in a silent film Only Rudolf KleinRogge hits any wrong notes  difficult as it undoubtedly must be to play a mad scientist in a silent film with subtlety some of his more unrestrained gesticulations leave you worried about the safety of the other actorsUltimately though it all inevitably comes back to the imagery Langs film remains unmatched even today Pick a scene any scene  the synchronised shuffling crowds at the shift change; our first sighting of the Metropolis all biplanes skyscrapers and suspended motorways; the vision of Moloch; the MachineMan awakening; Maria pursued along a pitchblack tunnel by a beam of light; the statue of Death coming to life in the Cathedral; disembodied eyes entranced by the twitching false Maria; the crowds swarming up the steps in the Tower of Babel section; the lifts crashing down one by one; desperate children crowding around Maria as the floodwaters close in; and most of all false Maria laughing as she burns on her pyre then transforming back to her metal visage No film before or since matches this for spectacle And if in order to appreciate it you have to swallow a little treacle about the heart being the mediator between head and hands well trust me its worth it,9
763,tt0017136,We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Langs Metropolis are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upperclass and operated by slavelike poor The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan These elements can be found in this films ancestors Frankenstein Batman Gattaca and the cities of Blade Runner Star Wars and The Fifth Element All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Langs workMetropolis has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes After its success in  the film has had an uneasy time Its pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in  Unless a lost version surfaces as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentinos  film Beyond the Rocks the complete work my never be seen again The restored version released on DVD in  was based on a digital restoration at K resolution from all available sources Its the best version that Ive seen and I would highly recommend that one if you havent seen the film The worst is a  print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration the film in grainy and difficult to see it doesnt even have a soundtrack I call that one the worst because Im still a little ambivalent about the  restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting good sound effects not so good and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy Freddy Mercury Bonnie Tyler Adam Ant and Pat Benatar yuck!Those who study the film myself included find the story impenetrable Some films you can easily decipher but Metropolis has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that its hard to pin it down as a whole Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the films chaotic nature It takes place in the future restored versions offer title cards that suggest that its the year  but I dont go by that in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers the Gothic sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives dancing in their penthouses and spending their money The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step They dont so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses slaves building his pyramids The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another One person that isnt ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his officeHis son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the workers children Curious he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there The woman is Maria a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be foundFreder uncovers a plot by Rotwang the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms This leads to the films most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzyThen all Hell breaks loose but the rest I must leave to you to discoverLang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film and therefore less successful the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers At one point Freder disguised as a worker witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen Another suggests an odd device a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around its edge The machine doesnt seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless dayThe film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism astonishing in its use of light and shadow One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in Another brilliant moment comes with Marias erotic dance as the men gawk the camera filled with their moist eyes This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home videoOther moments have deeper resonance There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves Walking to work they march with their heads down dressed in uniforms and caps It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler More obvious are Langs biblical references The rise of the city parallels Marias retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel The giant pentagram in Rotwangs lab as he plays God The breathtaking image of the plaguebringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself There is even a Christlike quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakersThese elements and images are brought to the film because of Langs insistence on no less then absolute perfection He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster working his cast and crew like a dictator He cast some  extras  of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone and worked them from morning till night The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with himI could go on and on this film all great films invite lengthy discussions It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over But when you get down to it the best way to view Metropolis is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of its time Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad,0
764,tt0017136,This truly is a classic masterpiece and honestly one of the best movies ever made The story is brilliant and the visuals amazingI have seen the German  minutes version of the movie without subtitles Yes its a long watch but its worth every second of it Basically only reason why the movie is so long is because they need about ten hand gestures to speak one sentence Its kind of dreadful to look at first but once youre used to it it shouldnt trouble you anymoreIn many ways this movie can be regarded as the Blade Runner of the s Metropolis is set in a futuristic world that has a same kind of atmosphere as in Blade Runner The mix of s cars and propellerplanes with futuristic machines highways buildings and androids is very unusual but an absolutely awesome thing to look at The movie was ahead of its time and in some ways also propheticThe story is absolutely the best thing of the movie Also the way the story is told and directed by Fritz Lang deserves credit The story is tense and has quite some symbolism layers and storylines but remains always easy to follow The ending is truly spectacular and tense The way how spectacular and tense the ending and the entire movie in general was really surprised me in a positive wayThe sets are obviously fake and miniatures at times but they still manage to convince and impress Further more the movie is filled with some fantastic and very convincing early special effectsMan who also deserves credit is Alfred Abel Wow what a great actor he was in this movieAn absolute must see and one of the best movies of all time/http//bobafettblogspotcom/,10
765,tt0017136,MetropolisMetropolis is one of the most exciting and exceptional works of art that humankind has produced This epic science fiction film is one of Germanys famous silent movies created by Fritz Lang and liberated in  the period between the two World WarsThis movie represents the expressionist cinema and shows us the repression of human needs by the machine age Langs creation of a selfdestructive society is a protest against the machine age Metropolis is one of the most magnificent cities of  is kept alive by the unceasing work of the underground people who live in slavery and is enjoyed by wealthy and educated people The Austrian director of the movie Fritz Lang presents the story of a master John Federsen who sees people as machines working constantly to maintain the luxury and technology of his metropolis On the other side his son Freder falls in love with one of the underground workers who is a spiritual leader for the slaves The son recognizes the unsentimental heart of his father and starts a revolution The city gets flooded and Maria Freders love regains the workers trust after a robot had stolen her identity she finds her loved one after saving the citys children and the workers shake hands with the masterExpressionism tries to simplify the world and to understand it emotionally in a subjective way It is very important to understand this definition of this dynamic violent and distorted movement in order to understand that Lang tried to externalize his own internal vision of the world through simple expressions The name metropolis comes from the Greeks and means mothercity It has this significance because a metropolis is the biggest form of a technologically and economically developed city Nevertheless referring to the movie name this film can be considered as the mother city of all cinematic clichés In this story there are two main characters Maria and Freder These two characters are also the heroes of the story because they are the ones who rescue the population from being drowned in the flood John Federson is a person full of empowering feelings who only thinks of himself and of his city forgetting about the ones who work for him All the fantasies that he has come true through the power of his workers but he never thinks about the danger they are in while working for him This man wants so much power that he is almost hypnotized by it; he is obsessed and possessed by the power of inventions and creationsOn the other hand Maria is just a symbol of munificence her soul is pure and she is seen like an angel who brings peace to the world Maria convoys the people in a church settling area She is shown as sanctity a holy person that is surrounded by the light of the candles She is positioned higher than the workers who carefully listen to her as she speaks about peace unity and their salvation by a mediator that will soon come Her eyes inspire confidence and kindness as she kisses Freder in the church scene In general all she does is for the good of humanity One thing that she repeats in the movie is Between the head and hands there must be a heart  This means that she realizes the bad things that the head John Frederson does and the good things that the hands workers do But she knows that these workers should not be treated poorly or like robots and that she can be the heart which can persuade the head and the hands to cooperate to come to common interests Maria as her name suggests is also a biblical motif She explains to the workers the story of the Tower of Babel The workers in the story destroy this tower which parallels how the movie will end with the destruction of the machines by the workforce Maria is still the representation of Jesus mother because she is trying to save the lives of the underground children She would sacrifice herself and alike Mother Mary she has a strong faith in the creator of the world All the scenes of this film are perfectly created at the eye level so that anyone is able to view the action However there is also a birds eye view at the beginning of the movie as the panorama of the city is shown from high above the ground This view was created to give us an impression of how widely extended and huge Metropolis is In addition the focus of the dramatic camera angles with bold shadows is on the disproportioned landscape as well as on the rightangled buildings There are moments in which the camera focuses on fast movement scenes like the dancing of the robot in the nightclub and scenes where it focuses on slow movement like in the beginning of the film where the slaves are shown going into the working area at a certain pace and aligned as robots When more people are involved in a scene like the one in which all the children are surrounding Maria as she rings the danger bell the angles are vertical triangular but when only one person is focused there is a closeup to allow us to read that characters expressions and feelings A good example would be the closeups on the master Fredersons eyes as he asks his secretary why his son was allowed to go underground and as well after that scene when he is thinking in order to suggest this dictators meditation and frustration Another important aspect of the camera and of Expressionism that I have remarked was the scene in which the mad scientist tries to run away from Freder and kidnaps Maria He is walking up on the roof of a sharpangled building holding Maria under his arm as if nothing would happen The same scene was notable in Robert Wienes film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari as Cesare walks up on the roof with the kidnapped fiancé and the city crowd follows himTime also is significant in the film because the clock keeps showing up in the most important scenes Time is evident in Fredersons office as his son challenges him to have mercy for the people as well as he is talking to his secretary Still only a small portion of the clock is shown in these shots and it means the time in which the master can think what decisions to take On the other hand a gigantic clock is shown as Freder finds an exhausted worker trying to turn a wallclock Freder understands the struggle of this man and replaces him There is where he finds out that at  pm Maria will have a meetingBut all that we have seen in this movie is not only made to show us the great importance of this silent SF film that can keep the watcher alive by its impressive music and can inspire contemporary movies like Matrix  but for its great historical importance Fritz Lang expressed a social life in this movie as well as a political one After WWI when Germany had lost a war peoples lives were a disaster Everyone was disoriented and could not keep up with the tragedy that was going on and maybe there were some influences of the great antiSemitism that was supposed to follow But Germany was a great disaster as well and there was nothing it could have done to prevent it because many troubles kept adding up over the years and this country had to be defeated morally and politically as well as economically Even if Germanys wish of reconstruction was as utopic as Fredersens wish of a technological city the postwar inflation had a big contribution on cinemas development,0
766,tt0017136,I typically dont like silent films but I decided to watch this one for two reasons  First I usually like scifi movies and second Metropolis had received so many glowing reviews that I couldnt pass it up  However my opinion of this film is below what most reviewers have been sayingKinos digitally remastered version on DVD is very impressive  The sound and picture quality are both excellent  However I have to conclude that favorable reviews of this film are likely based on nostalgia on the films influence on future films and on the incredible visual effects given its year of release  Film history buffs and silent film fans should see this movie  I thought this was a good film but not a great one  A rating of  is much too high and at # there are plenty of better films ranked below itFirst the good parts of the film  The special effects are excellent for a pres film  The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work the decisions they make and in how easily they are led/misled  The main character is well developed throughout the film and the audience can relate to him well  The film is visually stunning and impressive  The story of the working class vision of the future machinemen etc have had a very strong influence on many films which came later,4
767,tt0017136,For its time this movie has stunning visuals kind of Kubrickesqe in appearance especially the opening scenes of workers going and coming from work Its very strange with the group leaving walking with their heads down like zombiesThe set designs in here are also something that might draw your attention This really has a futuristic look I thought the visuals were fascinating This was German expressionist filmwork at its height I would think Director Fritz Lang went on to become a very famous man in his profession This wasnt his first effort but I think this might have been the film that put him on the map so to speak Several years later he gained a lot more fame with M At any rate with the photography sets and overall Flash Gordontype scifi look this must have been a real eyeopener to movies viewers  years ago I still think they look very cool today The music was also very dramatic at least in this restored  surround sound restoration DVD put out by KlinoObviously the eye makeup on men and the exaggerated motions by actors in silent films look a little hokey but I was mesmerized by Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and her evil clone She is something else! I also appreciated Klinos explanation of lost footage and how they did the best they could do to still make the story flow together They did an outstanding job I wouldnt attempt to watch this on anything less than this DVD which looks pretty darn goodThis is a worker story about a man wanting to trade his comfortable life to join the oppressed workers who do their thing beneath the earth in Metropolis Workers are seen as nothing but replaceable robots If someone gets hurt they get carted away and replaced immediately but some other zombielike human Of course people being mistreated can only take it for so long before rebellion Thats history from the days of the Jewish slaves in Egypt to today so thats part of this story too I wont say more to ruin itI dont want to mislead people on one major point todays audiences watching this Few people in  watch silent movies To ask them to sit through two hours of a silent film is obviously asking a lot I had to break this up into several viewings myself but thats okay I still enjoyed itbut it a silent movie this long is not easy to sit through You have to be a student of film or a big film buff to watch thisbut those people will be rewarded Over  reviews in here show you this film has enough to offer or at least take a look Now that this restored version is available check it out!,7
768,tt0017136,OK first of all Im not some kind of actionjunkie who thinks that the Rambotrilogy is the best movies of all time I am a person who think that other silents like Nosferatu and The Battleship Potemkin are entertainingAlthough I loved the previous movies referred to I thought this was one of the most dull movies ever As entertainment this movie cant go very far On a scale rating its abilities to entertain it gets a / from meAs a milestone in the history of movies it goes all the way to the top The special effects were great to have been made almost  years ago The editing was great It must have been one of the most expensive movie made to that date On the scale of how important a chapter in the cinematic history this is I will rate it a / That means a total / This also means that you should rather check out really good silents like Chaplins Modern Times Eisensteins The Battleship Potemkin and Murnaus Nosferatu,8
769,tt0017136,Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium and his  opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format a fully restored print on the KINO DVD filled with intertitles to keep the story complete that had me appreciate it more but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music ie Giorgio Moroders experimental cut it would still be affecting At the core of the story Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou the sides of good vs evil or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak is set up so strongly that even when it has its fairytale type of heaviness to it it doesnt seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults This is the kind of film that should work for anyone young and old as it deals with universal themes ie The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!The story leaves room for the visual style to come through Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis Joh Frederson He feels the sorrow and pain of the people and goes down to their level to be one of them He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women Maria played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm in multiple roles she plays without a fault who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freders father Enter the robot a marvel of a mad scientist who gets transposed from Maria and becomes the havocwrecker of the part of Metropolis I wont reveal too much of the story except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lapAmidst in all of this Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects cameratricks and of course editing if I wouldnt quite rank Metropolis in my alltime top ten favorites I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day cars moving on roads built to the sky airplanes flying everywhich way and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways But its not just the use of the models or the sets or the backdrops or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Langs shots which are all spectacular its also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene it also appears in other scenes I think Its little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages the superimpositions of faces and eyes in the dreamlike shotsAnd of course Langs greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story he goes beyond his time period in stylizing As I mentioned with the pacing being unique it was surprising though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M that many of the suspense sequences mob scenes/riots chases I knew that this is the same kind of styling thats used today for many of the most modern of sciencefiction/action films In its own way much like Stanley Kubricks  Space Oddysey it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling while not completely abandoning the storytelling form Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries and it hasnt been seen in its full form in almost eighty years what remains doesnt seem at all dated or crude Quite the opposite its visual expressiveness its use of time and character and action and its deliberate pacing makes it ahead of its time and influential and at the same time keeping itself unique Its a tale were all familiar with being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial cruel world which Im sure was even more relevant to post WW Germany at the time filmed with a mix of overthetop melodrama megabudget setpieces and designs that confound the senses Add the appropriate music and youve got a classic fantasy A tremendous film to see two three a dozen times over though some of those too impatient for films without spoken words or by the operatic dramatic side of it all may become disappointed or frustrated,10
770,tt0017136,For many years the initially flopped and consequently butchered Metropolis Fritz Lang made in the mid twenties of the past century could be appreciated at least for its qualities as the indispensable sciencefiction trailblazer in motion picture history What was severely lacking from the plot however finally emerged on screen again after the famous Buenos Aires reel find which brought a quarter of what was missing from the film back from the dead With the new painstaking  restoration effort also came a grandiose symphony orchestra studio recording of the original Gottfried Huppertz score  and the results make movie buffs prone to be blown away and this time for realThe technical brilliance and visual lavishness of Fritz Langs oeuvre was always undisputed already at its time and only matched by fellow German Murnaus ingenious approaches on filmmaking Theres so much and dense imagery that generations of future filmmakers would draw from this newly emerging archetype Among the unforgettable scenes are the giant heart machine which turns into a moloch in one of the heros visions the Babel tower teeming with utopian life the enormous sets elevators and masses and masses of enslaved and rebellious people the staggering creation of the first robot all set against the dominant dichotomy between  literally  those living above and those dying below There are echoes of communism here of nazi ideology of the dangers and abysses of industrialization technology and there are also glimpses of humanity Not perfect in all its components the film nevertheless has everything pioneering in it  and more Fritz Lang while having some reservations himself referred to the picture as a signpost for new destinations and thats exactly what it became now that we can look at the great scifi pictures of the past century In them and through them Metropolis still lives and once we revisit the original again we might yet be surprised that it miraculously still points ahead,10
771,tt0017925,Probably Buster Keatons best film and oddly enough its not even a straightforward comedy  its actually an action film with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure  `The General which is set during the Civil War is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray Buster Keaton of course who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army    and is turned down because the army feels hed be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier  However through a series of misunderstandings both Johnnys family and his girl think hes a coward and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier  Months pass and Johnny sad and alone is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North  Johnnys efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girls love  become an unbelievably funny and actionpacked series of events as Johnny tries to go from being a sadsack buffoon to being a heroIf you havent watched many silent films they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive as hes fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye  While funny Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well  His timing whether for a joke or for a tender moment is absolutely impeccableWhats also great about `The General is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldnt be made today  No amount of insurance would cover it  Keaton does all his own stunts and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General with a bike he sits on a moving cattlecatcher knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own  All these stunts are fantastic but its scary to think that any one of these probably couldve killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong  ,9
772,tt0017925,Buster Keaton once said that if he hadnt been a comedian he might have been a civil engineer He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics Its no wonder he adored trains the most elegant of machines and brought them into his movies whenever he could When one of Keatons former gagwriters loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this page of history to life His first certainty was that the production had to be so authentic it hurts He even insisted on using historically accurate narrowgauge railroad tracks which he found along with appropriate landscapes near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove OregonMost importantly the area had stretches of parallel tracks which allowed scenes of Buster on his trainagilely scrambling over the cars balancing on the roof to scan the horizon chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind himto be filmed from another train running alongside Buster his train and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Busters hair while smoky pinecovered hills rise and fall around him These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures and they put to shame all later backprojection and process shots models and computergenerated effects The quality of Keatons filmmaking is simplypun intendedunparalleled Every shot in The General is clean fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times The film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional just like the grave masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniformsThe Generals narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look Like a train it stays on track never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline Adapting the historical incident Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train Johnnie Gray rather than one of the raiders As he saw immediately The General is one long chase or rather two chases structured like the flight of a boomerang First Johnnie on a borrowed train the Texas chases his own stolen train the General He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines pursued by the raiders in the Texas who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high commandThe General is not Keatons funniest film but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs A number of the gags like the boxcar that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks have a long buildup for a relatively modest payoff But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings The cannon attached to the back of Busters train goes off just as the train starts around a curve so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders train coming out of the curve Riding on the cowcatcher Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his trains wheels so lost in thought he doesnt notice when the train starts to move carrying him up and down in gentle arcs stillness in motionI agree with author Jim Kline who describes The General as Keatons most personal film the one that best captures his unique vision spirit and personality In many of his films Buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero But his competent ingenious and athletic character in The General who is also modest tireless and underestimated comes much closer to his real nature There is a shot in The General of Busters eye isolated on screen framed by a hole in a white tablecloth that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertovs kinoglaz the cameraeye Keaton melds with his camera; theres no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies They have the same silence the same strictness the same strange blend of gravity and humorThe General might be the most serious comedy every made but its not a tragicomedy That as in Chaplins blending of pathos and low humor was something people took to immediately But no one knew what to make of The General Original reviews accused the film of being dull pretentious unoriginal and unfunny Even today people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing The General is challenging because it doesnt flaunt its virtues; like Keatons concise and economical performance it holds a great deal in reserve Take the movies most famous shot of a train crashing through a burning bridge for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film he doesnt dwell on it or hype it Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience never manipulates never overplays He doesnt show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents nor does he play for sympathy Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold But for those who can see the expressiveness of Busters socalled stone face who get his peculiar dry humor who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated Buster Keaton always has more than hes showing; you can see it in his eyes,10
773,tt0017925,It is generally or should I pun and say General Lee? said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keatons career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past but getting the correct rolling stock costumes weapons and props to make it look correct And it worked so well that Keaton never really could despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR outdo it In fact the closest thing to his best sound film or film that he influenced that was a sound film was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE where he returned to a Civil War themeTHE GENERAL as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE is based on the Andrews Raiders stealing of the Confederate locomotive The General and an attached train which was used to damage tracks and bridges The raid in February  was from northern Georgia into Tennesee It only lasted  miles as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial Others went to southern prisoner of war camps The effect of the incident far outstripped its military success The damage after all could be repaired But like Jimmy Doolittles Raid over Tokyo in April  it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky/Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhileDespite it being a brief incident of the war the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south When Lesney did it famous series of Models of Yesteryear the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was The GeneralThe story however was ultimately a downer But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period First he changes the viewers perspective  it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men but on the Confederates Secondly he builds up the story of Johnny Gray a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier Because Keatons family and girl friend Marion Mack see he is not enlisted they believe he turned cowardJohnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake the General from the raiders and the film has actually two chases in it  first Andrews and his men stealing the train and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking itAlong the way are many comic classic moments such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train or when at a moment of dejection Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase and finding Marion Mack there helping him are wonderful  especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired she throws away the ugly little ones Keatons reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful momentThe classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river and the burning of the railroad bridge with its destruction of a second locomotive It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history By the way the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest He was Mike Turkey Strut Donlin a frequent member and starring player of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the th Century Donlin who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases left baseball to become a film actor he had worked a bit in vaudeville Keaton was a sports fan and showed this in his film COLLEGE where he shows his abilities in several sports and hired Donlin This was the latters most famous performance  look at his reaction to the collapseIt must be regarded as Keatons finest film and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures,10
774,tt0017925,No one will top Keaton for physical risk and risk is what deep film experiences are all about This might be classed as a comedy but for me it touches deeply enough Its about a man who needs to prove himself by taking risks and being true And its by a man who takes even greater risks and is more true True to the spirit of the social compact here displayed as the chummy southHes always done stunts that amaze Many of his other films have things in them that if the timing were only a little off hed be seriously injured or die But this takes the cake Its almost as if he started with the idea that hed have three locos to play with and had a year to think up stunts And the stunts are so physical! And so dangerous And so so very effective His trademark is the deadpan face placed as a sort of innocent cluelessness Its particularly funny when you see the physical movements and you know that  they take incredible preparation and timing to pull off and  the fellow you see that looks so puzzled by the reality you see is the guy that devised and directed those stuntsTeds Evaluation   of  Worth watching,0
775,tt0017925,I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number # on the  version of AFIs Top  Movies of all time list It didnt make the cut at all for the original compilation in  so even before seeing the picture I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion I usually line up with the majority in most cases but I have to admit I dont quite get it with this picture I found it entertaining enough on occasion but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way its heralded on the DVD sleeve I dont think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy so right there my expectations were greatly reduced Keatons somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition dont help On the flip side I wouldnt have expected slapstick to move the story along either so at least I wasnt disappointed in that regardWhat I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity When Johnnie Gray Keaton dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army and pondered his situation while sitting on the trains connecting rod the resulting visual was pure genius The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnies thoughtful reverie and was one of the highlights of the picture for meThe other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge For starters I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb  unbelievableOh yes and I cant forget the sequence where Keatons marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a preCGI world its difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own For that Keaton deserves accoladesIn between all this clever film making however I just wasnt inspired The central plot element doesnt hold up for me  if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer why wasnt he simply told the reason why One could argue that then you wouldnt have a picture but for me it left the story on a shaky footing If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier the picture might have taken a different approach but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero Maybe Im second guessing a master but thats what I come away withConclusion  if this movie didnt make AFIs Top  Film List in  I dont understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top  At the same time Chaplins City Lights in my estimation a superior silent film fell OFF the list while The Gold Rush moved up a few notches I may not be a professional but I know what I like and this one just didnt do it for me,7
776,tt0017925,Buster Keatons The General about a man and his engine puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen From major comic situations to throwaway gags The General always knows what to doThe story begins in leisurely fashion A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray Keaton has two loves in his life his engine and his girlrespectively The General and Annabelle Lee Marion Mack Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle followed by two engineerworshipping boys and unknown to him Annabelle Lee herself He and his entourage arrive at the door; Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs slicks back his hair and gently taps the door with the door knocker Then he turns to notice Annabelle Keatons understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness Any other comedian would have done an explosive doubletakeNow Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor but the boys are there too Johnnie stands up puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave The heroworshippers are ready to follow but Johnnie lets them out first then closes the door on them This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pantsNow the two are alone Annabelles father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon the War Between the States has begun Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist then turns expectantly to Johnnie who cocks his head like a confused puppy She asks Arent you going to enlist? Realization hits him and he leaps off the seat Before he can run out the door Annabelle kisses him This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porchJohnnie races to the general store which is now a makeshift recruitment office Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation but the man rejects him Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer Later Annabelle believes that Johnnie didnt even try to enlist She refuses to speak to him again until hes in uniform What follows is a classic moment Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine Hes so miserable that he doesnt notice when he starts moving up and down until just before the train enters a tunnelTime passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General When nearly everyone is off the train having dinner the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine Annabelle a passenger herself was still on board She is now their prisonerBut Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen possibly by deserters He pursues the engine by taking another The Texas Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas but the Unionists think theyre outnumbered and continue to run What follows is the true joy of the movie two long chases separated by an important plot twist Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop actionI love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas At one point the car which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track reappears in front of the baffled engineer only to disappear later just as mysteriously We see the logical circumstances that lead to the cars seeming magic act and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied preventing him from seeing what we seeComic logic is important to The General In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable In a throwaway gag Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for itWe move to the second chase where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle LeeMarion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was She has hilarious moments The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire She takes a small stick and daintily puts it in Johnnie sarcastically hands her a sliver and she puts that in too Then in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping Johnnie grabs her and halfthrottles her before kissing her insteadThe final section most of it a battle scene includes the shot where The Texas begins to cross a burning bridge only to crash into the river Owing to Keatons disdain of fakery one of several reasons his works seem modern he did not use a model but a real train on a real burning bridge The crash cost $reportedly making it the single most expensive shot ever in a silent filmA worthy closing gag was too taxing even for Keatons ingenuity Johnnies dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers His remedy is only mildly funny Is anyone complaining? The General is a work of art and a work of genius,0
777,tt0017925,This film flopped when it was released in late  for several reasons First its premiere was delayed because Flesh and the Devil was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks Second people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian not Buster the filmmaker and director which is more of the role he played here The film was funny but it was not gag after gag like so many of Keatons other films Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South A title card declares he has two loves  his girl and his engine when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession His girlfriend misunderstands thinks him a coward and says she wont speak to him again until he is in uniformMeanwhile the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Busters train Unknown to Buster his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train still without the knowledge of his girls captivity by the Union armyForgotten with the arrival of sound the film revived  often cut up from its original length  in the s because Buster didnt preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today often with poor video and hideous musical accompanimentToday The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too SHERLOCK JR is clever OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious The General is both of these things Its story driven races to a climax and is fueled by cute clever inventive gagsBuster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in A Southern Yankee,9
778,tt0017925,One of the great masterpieces of cinema Buster Keatons The General combines inventive humor with terrific action and fine melodrama all beautifully and carefully planned and photographed  It is filled with subtle and wonderful details that make it well worth devoting your full attention to watching  As an extra bonus it offers a fascinating look at the Civil War era with many realistic details inspired by a historical incidentAfter a short opening sequence the movie divides nicely into two halves Johnny Keaton is a railway engineer turned down in his attempts to enlist in the Confederate Army and subsequently rejected by his girl  Continuing with the railroad one day his locomotive is stolen by Union spies who also kidnap his girl  Johnny first chases the engine into Union territory to recapture it and then is himself chased by the Northern Army as he attempts to return home  Both chases are filled with excitement and manic fun with some breathtaking stunts by Keaton thrown in  It all leads up to a dramatic and memorable climax that includes many ironic and suggestive touchesKeaton is at his best with the story offering him a perfect showcase for his many talents  His slapstick and acrobatic skills are given free rein and his characters stoic perseverance is a fine complement to the frantic actionThis belongs near the top of any list of great films a classic worth watching and rewatching,0
779,tt0017925,I havent had so much fun watching a movie for a long time The General is a silent comedy mostly slapstick about Johnny Gray a train engineer with two loves his engine and Annabelle Lee Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer Things are then sped up a year where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan As it so happens they steal Johnnys engine a big mistakeBuster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies but of course less old He is often ignorant of what is going on around him leading to plenty of laughs This also makes him a very charismatic characterThere are countless train related jokes The first one comes right at the beginning when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman in a line much like a train The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment The finale is explosiveThe General was a lot of fun to watch It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies and had plenty of substance on top of that This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever After my first viewing it instantly became one of my favorites It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies,10
780,tt0017925,THE GENERAL represents the greatest achievement screen comedy ever accomplished From the brilliant gag construction to the sheer excellence of the filmmaking technique THE GENERAL is a hilarious and amazing journey into comedy Written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman Keaton brings brilliant gags into the story The film begins when Keaton is told he is of no use to the South as a soldier but as a train engineer However his girlfriend refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform After the war has started the girl is kidnapped by some Union raiders on Keatons train and so begins the greatest and funniest chase ever filmed For the next  minutes the viewer is in Keatons world His gags routines and amazing slapstick serve to make this the greatest screen comedy ever filmedMatt age ,0
781,tt0017925,Ive seen one other silent movie in my life but it was Mel Brookss The Silent Movie so I dont know if it really counts I really enjoyed The General overall more than I thought I would as someone who was born after The GodfatherThe main thing that surprised me was the fact that I couldnt look down to write very many notes; any time I took my eyes off the screen I ran a serious risk of missing something It seems to me that the film even though it was long or seemed so it was very dense in terms of action I imagine that since the movie has no dialogue the filmmakers must make up for it by making it as visually interesting and entertaining as possible I am accustomed to more modern movies with snappy dialogue and special effects and suchmovies in which you can look down at your popcorn or kiss your date and not miss too much because you can hear pretty much whats happening This was a nice change for meObviously Ive never seen a Buster Keaton film and Im not even sure if Id heard of him before this class But I can see why he is so appealing in his films I loved his facial expressions particularly the stoicbutcrestfallen look in his eyes on the train when something else goes wrong He also has great control of his body as we discussed in class and a fine sense of comic timingI found the film surprisingly funny Many modern films that I think are funny eg Austin Powers Toy Story American Beauty rely largely on witty or outrageous dialogue for their humor As a silent film The General must rely mainly on images for its humorthe slapstick images of Johnnie falling over constantly the unusual image of Johnnie riding up and down on the crossbar between the train wheels the stereotype exploitation in the scene when the girl sweeps out the locomotive Im sure that some of the things that I considered amusing might not have been considered funny by the original audience such as the recordscratch lightning bolts,0
782,tt0017925, Georgia USA The American Civil War is in its second year and Johnnie Gray is barred from enlisting He is a train engineer and the Confederate Army feel he is more valuable to the Southern cause in his current role than in the army This frustrates Johnnie and has estranged him from his sweetheart Annabelle who views him as a coward Then his beloved engine The General is stolen by Union spies and is heading for Union lines Moreover Annabelle is on board Johnnie sets off after the two loves of his lifeGreat comedy from the silent era directed and starring one of the greatest comedy directors and actors of that era Buster Keaton This is a rollicking adventure complete with wonderfully thoughtout and performed physical comedy and other sight gags Some very clever use of the plot to generate the comedyThe plot itself isnt overly profound but crams in a lot of action and adventure plus some romanceVery entertaining,8
783,tt0017925,THE GENERAL When one watches for the first time the General great things happen laughter relief a neverending smileand that old sniff of old good cinema I must admit not many films out there give the pleasure this one has It is like everything just falls right into place Overall the movie is a perfect account of all the things that make comedy great Simplicity good and twisted plot a sense of the unexpected becoming more and more realDo you feel me dont you? It has been attributed to Chalie Chaplin the following sentence to make a comedy film you only need three things a park a woman and a police officer We can safely say The General stands up to it Well there is no park in The General although the landscape is used wisely but theres a woman As for the police officerwell not exactly What we do have in the film are soldiers Im afraid of telling you the plot of the story because I dont want to spoil anything I reckon itd be better if you find it out for yourselves Well lets just say that Buster Keaton plays the main character an engineer whose beloved locomotive has been stolen by Union spies From that point on he does everything in his power to get it back Theres nothing more for me to say butEnjoy yourselves!!,8
784,tt0017925,To watch The General is to be both awed and amused at what takes place The consensus view is correct This is an amazing movieYou know whats more amazing? Despite what most critics say Buster Keaton made funnier better films than thisKeaton a lifelong railroad buff is engineer Johnny Gray captain of The General a locomotive which carries passengers and freight across the American South When the Civil War breaks out he tries to enlist and thus please his girl Annabelle Lee Marion Mack but the authorities deem him more useful running trains When Union spies seize the General with an idea of using it to burn bridges and disrupt the Confederate supply line its up to Gray to save the dayNew York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall reviewed The General back in  and expressed disappointment This is by no means so good as Mr Keatons previous efforts he wrote People cite Halls review as a classic example of whatdocriticsknow but the more I read the more I agreed with him The fun is not exactly plentiful he wrote noting Keaton here was too much the acrobat too little the clownWhen I watched The General I felt disappointment too Like Halls it wasnt total; its exciting and inventive and boasts some of the finest screen compositions Ive ever seen The technical expertise on display is astounding Its just that the overall experience left me a bit flatFirst you have what Roger Ebert liked to call the idiot plot Gray tries to enlist and is rejected by the army because hes too valuable as a train engineer Annabelle apparently never learns this for she rejects him as a coward I dont want you to speak to me again until youre in uniform she huffsEither hes an idiot for not explaining the truth of the matter or shes an idiot for preferring her lover be cannon fodder than a real asset to their cause Anyway Buster does manage to make this play later on When he finally speaks to her he is in uniform an enemy uniformThe other main issue involves what Lincoln called the slows A lot of the story is literally trainwatching Buster does some brave amazing stuntwork and throws in some clever gags later joined by Mack whos no Sibil Seely but still quite game but its basically a lot of watching trains go by The craft here is in the precision of the camerawork and the splitsecond timing not so much the comedy In fact except for Buster himself everyone plays it completely straight probably because this is real history being presented Compared to other Keaton comedies it feels a bit straitjacketed by thatThe General is still a solid thrill comedy with some amusing one liners If you lose this war dont blame me Johnny yells after being rejected and brilliant sight gags like the fussy Annabelles rejection of unattractive firewood while Buster struggles to stoke the engineTo me thats enough for The General to be another good reason for loving Buster Keaton I just cant understand it being the preeminent reason Maybe critics cant really love a comedy for just making you laugh and laugh Im just glad Keaton made other movies at least as brilliant as The General and funnier too,7
785,tt0017925,Buster Keaton s performance in The General was purely enjoyable The story takes place during the civil war on centers on Johnnie Gray Keaton a train operator in the South Johnnie is not accepted for service in the confederate army because of his value on the railroad and suffers the shame of being home while the other men are fighting a war When his beloved engine is hijacked by Union soldiers the unpredictable story goes into overdrive Johnnies adventure includes train chases rescuing the love of his life a daring escape and a climactic battle This film has a distinct action/adventure aspect but at its core it is a brilliant comedy/drama Keatons performance is superb He has the ability to effortlessly change your mood and the mood of the film with his facial expressions and physical comedy Keatons character seems to make endless mistakes that work for the best and good decisions in dangerous situations It is easy to imagine Keaton as a major influence for a future comedians and I personally felt like I was watching the Mel Brooks of a previous generation The General was a fun film to watch with a true star Buster Keaton turning in a timeless heartfelt performance,7
786,tt0017925,When watching The General  the similarities between Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin are almost unmistakable The story was original and humorous and the performance by Buster Keaton was pleasing What I didnt like was the fact that the protagonist still was pursuing the girl who was so quick to leave him when she thought he wasnt brave and then ends up staying with her at the end He is too good for her I thought the stunt where the bridge gives out and the train falls was very well done and must have cost a fortune There were scenes where I found myself laughing out loud and scenes where I was bored So unfortunately the film doesnt do a great job at keeping the viewer glued to the screen but overall it was enjoyable,7
787,tt0017925,I feel the The General is a great silent film because even though the story line is relatively complicated the way in which each character played their part and the way it was filmed made it easy to follow I am fairly new to the silent film experience and when I saw that this movie was partially a comedy I was expecting something more along the lines of Charlie Chaplin however I was pleasantly surprised at Buster Keatons more subtle comedic style I felt that the film was well shot shot considering the technology of the day I was actually shocked during the scene where the Rock River Bridge collapsed under The Texas Knowing full well it was not special effects I couldnt believe the producers would spare the expense of destroying a locomotive and an entire bridge This movie is sure to be one of my favorite silent films,7
788,tt0017925,Buster Keaton always amazes me He was truly one of the most hilarious deadpan screen clowns of early cinema And The General even clocking in at around three hours is surprisingly watchable based on his physical performance aloneGranted I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything thats unnecessary but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments There are multiple points in the General a story about a Southern engineer that has to rescue his beloved from the clutches of the North in the Civil War where Keatons character Johnnie Gray has to stop his train jump out and remove something from the tracks which in itself can be quite boring but the way that Keaton injects physical comedy into those moments keeps me entertainedAnd its a marvel how so many realistic yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with Its nothing fantastic like some of his other films but its still funny And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversitybut he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and its just enough to know that he is frightened but that the rest of him doesnt react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny Whether hes pratfalling due to surprise or erroneously succeeding at something hes unskilled in and being shocked by it that response of his is winningBut the General does show its age a little It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesnt get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context I wouldnt dare cut those moments out of this film even if I could reedit it because the space always had something going on but at the same time this film if made today would be cut to oneandahalf or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly The plot and story are simple but exist more than to just help the comedy move alongexcept at the end when the first story was accomplished Then we move into a second extraneous but still amusing story regarding a battle between the North and the South that couldve been excised and still having a decent though simple storyI didnt really love the score that the DVD company attached to it which is a number of classical pieces end on end I think a new commissioned soundtrack wouldve better matched the piece but I guess we get what we get And on the plus side you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of itIs it perfect? No But despite the age it shows it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinemas greatest physical comedians If you want to spend three hours with a silent clown this is not a bad way to go /,8
789,tt0017925,Have a lot of appreciation for comedy especially the witty and sophisticated kinds and there are a good deal of classic comedies that go for the broad approach too Am significantly less keen though on the vulgar puerile style of humour that is seen quite a lot today the worst of it veering on the offensive There are many instances of silent films/comedies seen with Charlie Chaplin prime Laurel and Hardy and with Buster KeatonKeaton is seen as one of the greats by many but for some reason doesnt seem to be quite as well known even with a just as good reputation critically as Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy who transitioned better into sound maybe when at his best in the s an extraordinary period with a deservedly lauded reputation he was every bit as great as funny and as likeable His daring physical comedy and stoic deadpan expressions were unique and ahead of its time at the time and still amaze and are distinct now plus he was a bigger risktaker with bolder material and immense courage that most wish they could have Which perhaps hasnt been more apparent than in this film The General often considered one of his best and most important films or even his masterpiece though with other just as worthy efforts it has been debated and justifiably so This paragraph is very subjective of course and probably wont be agreed with but that is just my respectful stanceThe General to this day still looks great and remarkably lavish something of a technical achievement in its day It also should be used as an example of how to have effects that still look good and like a lot of effort and care went into them and also use them properly rather than overusing and abusing them to gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now The locomotive features heavily here and to ingenious and quite imaginative effect The direction keeps the momentum going with ease and balances all The Generals elements every bit as adeptlyWhen it comes to the humour which is very physical it is never less than very funny and is timed inventively throughout no corniness at all and it gels very well But The General is much more than just a comedy and one can say that its not really one It has other elements too and executes them even better actually especially the action the scope dexterity and boldness of it and especially those stunts absolutely jawdropping and truly exciting to watch It is also an example of how to have action that thrills while being easy on the eyes coherent and not being too noisy or busy something to learn fromAlso here is a tender understated quality that is very surprising and the romantic element is genuinely charming without being sappy The film also has a story thats easy to follow and at the same time is logical and interesting indicating a film with brains as well as soul that treats the viewer with respect rather than getting irritated by credibility straining and logic lapses Keaton is superb here not only is his comic timing on point but he provides a character thats endearing and worth rooting for His physicality and how he copes with the stunts is aweinspiring and he is one of not many to make deadpan interesting and entertaining because he still makes it very expressive and nuanced The rest of the cast are easy to overlook but are just as strong even if with not as much to do or with material that sticks in the mind as muchOverall brilliant and a Buster Keaton essential / Bethany Cox,10
790,tt0017925,There are some truly wonderful scenes in this film which is full of adventure comedy and some pretty impressive stuntwork on moving trains by Buster Keaton and the other actors The premise is that Keaton a train conductor has volunteered to fight for the South at the outset of the Civil War but been turned down When his train is stolen by Union soldiers he immediately gives chase on foot then a handcar briefly a bicycle and then finally another train not knowing quite yet that his girlfriend Marion Mack was inadvertently also kidnappedIn one of the memorable early scenes Keaton is sitting on the connecting rod of the locomotive lost in thought when it starts up bobbing him up and down In another he packs a cannon on his train with a massive charge and as its angle slowly descends before firing it appears hes going to blow himself up until his train at the last minute hits a curve and he nearly hits his intended target Its just wonderful There is also of course the scene with a Union train going out onto a burning bridge which then collapses one of the most iconic and expensive scenes of the eraIn addition to those big moments there are also innumerable little things Keaton does which highlight his genius He is just so lovable and talented He uses one of the large railroad ties intended to derail him to knock another off the track as his train is moving When hes hiding under a table surrounded by Union officers hes subtly kicked and jostled in funny ways As he makes his escape with Mack he stuffs her into a large sack that he had emptied of shoes only to lose his own shoe in the process and struggle to locate it I also thought I saw bits of Woody Allen in the scene where he urges her to be quiet only to knock things over and make noise himselfAmbitious aweinspiring influential clever and still funny + years later Is it the best ever? I dont know I liked The Cameraman  even more but still – damn good,9
791,tt0017925,Buster Keaton is Johnnie Gray a southerner who wants to fight for the cause but gets rejected because he could be of more use as an engineer than as a soldier Unfortunately hes not told why he was turned down and his gal just assumes that hes a coward Not so because when a Yankee scallywag steals his beloved steam engine the titular The General Johnnie heads north to recover the engine and through a series of misadventures becomes a hero of the Confederacy and rescues Annabelle Lee Glorious sight gags abound as Old Stone Face deals with errant cannon loose sword blades uncooperative firewood inexplicable soakings and a lessthanhelpful rescuee not to mention an entire army of bluebellies Great fun from another era and a wonderful example of the silent genre,8
792,tt0017925,Buster Keaton plays the lead in this silent era masterpiece that takes its inspiration from the Great Locomotive Chase which in turn was a real event during the American Civil War in which a train was stolen by the North and sped over the lines in preparation for the coming offenseThe General has some definitive upsides working in its favour Buster Keaton is an amazingly versatile performer able to go from clownish jokester to a saddened victim of war and poor circumstances in a heartbeat The film is also really ambitious in scope Keaton performs all of his stunts most of them hairraisingly dangerous and completely unimaginable nowadays Plus very little money is spared and the film famously has some of the most expensive set pieces and stunts of the silent eraThe plot of the film is also a lot more cohesive than say in the films made by Charlie Chaplin in the same decade Chaplins films usually contain segments that have little to do with anything except the need for funny situations The General is also a comedy but with a clear clean story arcOn the other hand I didnt find the humour or the characters as captivating Theyre okay but in this regard the decades of cultural development between the film and yours truly work against the film I just didnt find the slapstick all that funnyStill The General is a great watch for all interested in early cinema or really involved physical humour,0
793,tt0017925,The General is one of the great films and treasures of the silent era Its among the best movies of the talented comedy actor Buster Keaton In this film Keaton shows the athletic ability and courage that made him one of the best of the early comedians who performed their own stunts His physical antics on and off his train The General support his title as king of comedy stunts All the silent era comedy actors seemed to have lots of energy And many had daring courage and even madness at times Those were the actors who did all or most of their own stunts While there were some stunt men around in the early s it wasnt until the last of the silent years and dawn of sound pictures that stuntmen were a regular part of the cast of films that required any amount of derringdo And while a small number of actors today will still do some of their own stunts nothing can compare to the actors of old who performed their own highrisk and dangerous stunts – and sometimes those for other actors The five best early actors at doing stunts were Buster Keaton Douglas Fairbanks Sr Harold Lloyd Tom Mix and Yakima Canutt The latter two specialized in Westerns and besides acting and doing stunt work Mix and Canutt regularly rode and performed in the rodeo circuit Lloyd was versatile in his venues but excelled at high stunts on buildings and sometimes with wild animals Fairbanks excelled in swashbuckler stunts sliding down the sails of ships swinging from anything hanging aloft and jumping with the help of trampolines into windows Keaton was even more versatile As a child actor in vaudeville Keaton learned how to fall to avoid injury He called his technique soft falls or landings But even with his training and practice his film roles with derringdo often left him bruised at the least At other times he had suffered injuries from slight to serious Still he had become known for his physical resiliency During the filming of The General in  Keaton was knocked unconscious by canon fire He suffered a broken ankle while filming the  short The Electric House And he broke his neck during the  shooting of Sherlock Jr but didnt know it until years later This movie has an interesting plot set during the US Civil War It opens with a scene and script that reads The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marietta Georgia in the spring of  The train seems to be traveling about  miles per hour But the film is almost entirely about action and the comedy in the action involving the train There is an element of romance The cast all are very good The photography is superb Much of the action with trains is filmed in Westcentral Oregon from Eugene to Cottage Grove Theres no information about sound at all so I assume the music we hear with the film is soundtrack that was added for modern viewing It probably is meant to replicate the piano accompaniment that was usual with silent films in theaters of the day This is one instance when I think the piano playing would have been better The music seems to go overboard at times This is one of the early great films from the silent era that showcase the talent and early mastery of moviemaking skills Its a fun movie with strong visuals that even a modern family of all ages should enjoy,10
794,tt0017925,Johnnie Gray a train engineer tries to enlist in the Confederate Army to impress his girlfriend Unfortunately he is rejected because his role as engineer is deemed more important Lucky for Gray he is given the opportunity to prove himself when a band of Union soldiers in disguise hijack a trainAt the time of this films release it was a flop and considered to be not very funny Since then it has gone on to be declared one of the greatest films of all time Funny how that works I would tend to agree that it isnt really very funny but it is a great film for a variety of reasonsBuster Keaton was an amazing actor and director He was willing to put himself in dangerous situations for a laugh  he was his own stuntman right there when the train falls in the water really sitting on the side of a moving train and on the front of it he could have been killed And this was captured on film flawlesslyPersonally I enjoyed his Sherlock Jr better I thought the tricks were better and the action funnier It had a faster pace too that kept me hooked enough to watch it a few times The General was not boring but as a silent film it could have done more to grab the audience and Im not sure that it did,7
795,tt0021749,If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend as others have pointed to in the past City Lights is the one Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies like Modern Times and The Gold Rush City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest his bravest his most romantic and his most sympathetic Its tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters but its pulled off The film centers on three characters the Tramp the quintessential funny homeless man who blends into the crowd but gets caught in predicaments He helps a drunken businessman Myers a fine performance in his own right from suicide and becomes his on and off again friend that is when it suits him and doesnt notice his friends state The other person in the Tramps life is the Blind Flower Girl Virginia Cherrill one of the most absorbing beautiful and key female performances in silent film who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money which leads to a how else can I put it magical boxing match where its basically a  from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull Though there is no dialog the film achieves a timelessness its essentially a tale of two loners who find each other lose each other and find each other again the last scene widely discussed by critics for decades is moving if not tearinducing And its never ever boring once you get along with the Tramp you find the little things about him the reaction shots the little things he does after the usual big gag look to the ballroom scene for examples of this or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing Truth be told if this film makes you indifferent never watch Chaplin again But if you give yourself to the film you may find its one of the most charming from the era or perhaps any era,10
796,tt0021749,Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplins City Lights a masterpiece Its only  minutes long but they are among the best  minutes you could spend at the movies and the last five minutes are simply exquisite Keep your Kleenex box at arms length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says Yes I can see now the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanationChaplin was at his zenith in  when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story and the Little Tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade He had already made the classics The Gold Rush  and The Circus  starring his character so its obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time The advent of talkies didnt stop Chaplin from making this Comedy Romance in Pantomime as he subtitled it as he knew giving the Little Tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character What I particularly enjoyed in this film is how the Little Tramp fancies himself as a wellmannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down even going to prison for love It is this selfdelusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl played in an effectively plaintive manner by Virginia Cherrill Her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable Simply compare her to the screen test shown of Georgia Hale Chaplins leading lady in The Gold Rush and an obviously more experienced actress than Cherrill as Hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the Little Tramp is the wealthy gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sightOf course this would not be a Chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes  the rising and lowering of the street elevator the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers and was according to the footage included as a DVD extra inspired by an earlier Chaplin short The Champion from  Even a simple moment for example when the Little Tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment And special mention needs to go to Chaplins musical score where he beautifully interweaves José Padillas La Violetta as his love themeThe transfer to DVD is very good and the DVD set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality The Serge Bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film and the footage of Chaplin from a Vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the longforgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then The aforementioned Georgia Hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long The minute home movie of Chaplins trip to Bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise Regardless the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies Chaplins reputation as one of the worlds leading filmmakers,10
797,tt0021749,This is my favorite Chaplin film but I dont want that to diminish his other work either MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick and even the largelyneglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone Chaplin didnt make a bad movie and Im not even sure that CL is his best exactly But it IS my favorite if only for the endingThat ending has been the subject of much comment here I think its a masterpiece in a single scene Chaplins little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living breathing human being Its a monument to understated sentimentalityTo me the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid Yes the boxing scene is great and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful but its that ending that makes us all love this movie,0
798,tt0021749,Once again Chaplin plays his famous creation the beloved Tramp The noble Little Fellow meets and falls in love with a blind flower girl She assumes he is wealthy man and offers him a flower which he attentively accepts with his last penny One night by chance he rescues a drunken millionaire from drowning The rich gentleman becomes a generous friend when drunk but doesnt recognize the tramp when sober Chaplin takes the blind girl under his wing and takes flight with the millionaires money to cure her blindness City Lights engaged a true genius in a graceful and touching performance which arouses profound feelings and joy with great simplicity of style and tragic tale Each scene was the result of hardworking detail and planning,9
799,tt0021749,Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights and the results are spectacular The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights and even though Charlies performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant City Lights is so well made that it is one of the very few movies in which the obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked Yes you can clearly see the string holding Chaplin up in the sidesplittingly funny boxing scene but who cares? That is such classic slapstick that little things like that really dont matter Besides lets keep in mind that this movie was made seventy years ago Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk His friendship with the drunken rich guy is hilarious but it also makes a significant comment about the problems of alcohol This is truly a great film which should not be forgotten,10
800,tt0021749,Charlie Chaplins City Lights contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it  Although made very much in the oldfashioned silent film tradition much of it is timeless tooAfter a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning Charlies little tramp character makes two acquaintances  He meets a blind girl selling flowers who mistakes him for a rich man and the two become very fond of each other Then he meets a real millionaire who is drunk depressed and about to commit suicide  In a comic scene the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it making himself a devoted friendThe tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight and tries to think of some way he could help  His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades  his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny and one of Chaplins best comic pieces Meanwhile when his millionaire friend is drunk he dotes on the tramp but when sober he forgets who the tramp is leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for CharlieAll of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the bestremembered scenes in any film  City Lights shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master who without words can move his audience or make them laugh  Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once,0
801,tt0021749,Film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia  Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are  Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation  We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new  In City Lights and other silent works of film a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere  While watching the film I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story the sets the crew; the whole project  While this may not have been the complete reality it felt that way and thus made the film more enjoyable  In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional responseSince film is at its very core a visual medium I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium  I dont use the word basic here in a demeaning sense but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance  Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced but they were and are beautiful  The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic There is a warmth found in City Lights and other Chaplin films The Kid Modern Times that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today  Maybe its just that with simplicity comes honesty and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer,0
802,tt0021749,City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of filmmaking Chaplins last silent film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the mans wealth to make her fall in love with him The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesnt recognize the tramp anymore On top of this the flower girl has to pay  dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forthThe outcome of the movie is to almost all people known It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film The movie itself still is masterpiece more than  years after its release I personally rate this as Chaplins second best I have seen so far My favorite remains The Gold Rush Still this movie gets / stars from me,9
803,tt0021749,I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplins nicest most underappreciated silent movie gems Then I discovered it really wasnt underrated; its rated very high on most critics lists It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this onePart of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that Im a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one Its a romance between Charlies tramp character no name and a blind girl who also had no name in this film Virginia Cherill who played the blind woman and had a wholesome pretty face which I found very attractiveIm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as talkies were out in full force by  Chaplin was at his best in silent movies anyway and his comedy routines are legendary He gave me a lot of laughs in this film as always and I particularly laughed I love slapstick at the boxing scene Kudos too to Harry Myers as the eccentric millionaireTheres a lot of drama as well as humor in this minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sightComedy romance drama with suffering all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment Its hard to believe this movie was not up for one single Academy Award,9
804,tt0021749,CITY LIGHTS United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  l is a silent comedydrama released at the height of the sound era Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad Chaplin gambled with this production and made it pay off Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH  as the one movie he would most want to be remembered CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time practically places his other silent masterpiece THE CIRCUS  to oblivion CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama but in Chaplins case pathosSubtitled A comedy romance in pantomime the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city After the unveiling the crowd finds a little tramp Charlie Chaplin sleeping on the lap of one of the figures As he tries to climb down he encounters one problem after another This opening scene alone is priceless With such a great beginning Chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot The theme to CITY LIGHTS is remembered mainly about a tramps love for a blind girl However there is a subplot involving the tramps involvement with a millionaire drunk which by far takes up more time than the sentimental love story These two segments actually set the pattern First segment set in the afternoon finds Charlie walking down the street examining a nude statue in a shop being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing He encounters a beautiful blonde girl Virginia Cherrill selling flowers After she drops one of her flowers Charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it thus realizing shes blind Smitten by her beauty he picks it up and pays her for it Minutes later the slamming of a limousine door is heard with the girl believing the kind gentleman Charlie to be a millionaire Second segment set at night finds Charlie encountering a drunk Harry Myers trying to commit suicide by drowning himself Just as Charlie is about to save him he in turn falls into the river The drunk in gratitude for saving his life takes Charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn By morning the millionaire now sober fails to recognize or remember Charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion This running gag thats repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious but Chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges By day Charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when shes not at her usual corner selling flowers Finding that shes ill and being cared by her grandmother Florence Lee whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction Charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs ranging from streetcleaning to fighting in a boxing match Reading in a newspaper of a European doctor who restores sight for the blind Charlie gives the girl $ for an operation the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire who after sober accuses Charlie of robbing him has his arrested and serving jail time The climatic finish is truly the best thing Chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missedFeatured in the supporting cast are Henry Bergman Allan Garcia Albert Austin and Hank Mann While much has been discussed about Chaplins performance his costar Virginia Cherrill as the blind girl no name given should not go without mention Even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor Cary Grant her performance is excellent by all means Although its been said that future film star Jean Harlow  appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence she is visible in a surviving still photograph but no such scene appears in the finished product Unlike THE GOLD RUSH CITY LIGHTS had limited showings in revival houses in later years and was never allowed to be distributed to television Being first introduced to CITY LIGHTS at New York Citys revival movie house The Regency Theater formerly located on Broadway and th Street in  the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience There was one man probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film No doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else Watching CITY LIGHTS surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in After Chaplins death in December of  CITY LIGHTS along with his other silent features were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure but became readily available on video cassette at the time of Chaplins th birthday  In later years CITY LIGHTS was frequently revived on various cable channels ranging from Turner Network Television TNT in the early s American Movie Classics up to  and finally Turner Classic Movies The complete musical soundtrack that accompanies CITY LIGHTS happens to be the original score composed to perfection by Chaplin himself Much has been written and said about CITY LIGHTS over the years To learn more about the making difficulties and long term preparations to CITY LIGHTS either watch Kevin Blownlows  documentary Hollywood A Celebration of the American Silent Film as narrated by James Mason or Brownlows other documentaries dedicated entirely to Chaplins career including outtakes to CITY LIGHTS as well as scenes involving Virginia Cherrills temporary replacement Georgia Hale Chaplins costar in THE GOLD RUSH ****,10
805,tt0021749,Spoilers hereinFor me this film falls not into the category of favorite films Im a Marx brothers kind of guy but earns instead a place on a very short list of most important moviesThats because it has two features that I truly appreciateIt is as pure a vision of its creator as is possible Nearly all other films are engineered from prior work Not so with a small list of projects from Welles Kurosawa Eisenstein  and this one project of Chaplins They are wholly original springing from some nether worldBut the other element is the one that impresses the most This film is about itself about the art of visual narrative Chaplin was intelligent enough to know that what he was doing was new The issues are centered on what the audience `sees so while he struggles with what and how the audience sees he builds that into the fabric of the storyThe primary framing is about the blind girl who falls in love with him by `seeing him in her own way Then `sees him at the end in a different way The rich man recognizes the tramp when drunk but does not when he is not Nearly all the jokes indeed every element of the film is about this same dynamic the elevator which is not seen but then was the burglars the same the Tramp on the statue on the barrel Even seeing the cigar before the bum does Even us seeing the soap and the foreman notThe `seeing is carried over to `hearing with the politician and whistle jokes And then even further as Charlie turns his back on the new technology of giving us speech and instead `shows us something else he writes and conducts an amazing score instead This is truly amazing and one reason to take Mike Figgis seriouslyNo wonder Orson Welles considered this the most important film ever made But as to the best to watch? Because film is so derivative my own gold standard for the Tramp is Robert Downeys and to some extent Depps Comic timing is something that evolves and those men make a more effective Tramp for my modern ability to seeTrivia Chaplin found the `blind girl in a group of spectators at a fight and was struck with how her expressions reflected what she saw Shes pretty as well of course but certainly not the prettiest Chaplin knew See how Chaplin separately works in both the fight a performance and her reaction to his performance in the film,0
806,tt0021749,Waddling along with his cane and derby hat and that tiny mustache the little tramp Charles Chaplin is visually unlike any character in film history The tramp is kindhearted always dignified Hes a simple soul who in City Lights tries to help out a young blind woman well played by Virginia Cherrill This is a silent film of course but the tramps body language is his speechThe really noticeable feature of the tramp character is how he blends into everyday life Hes more or less ignored by many laughed at by others The girls grandmother never sees him at all And only when the millionaire is drunk does he see the tramp as a friend Curious  and deepThe tramp gets into his fair share of trouble but only through his bumbling efforts to help the girl The boxing match is a hoot and very well choreographed as are all the skits And what a beginning for a film with city leaders spouting gibberish probably as Chaplins dig at the talkies Then the way Chaplin makes his grand entrance  just terrific!Melancholy at times the films music really tugs at your heartstrings Maybe its sentimental and manipulative But given the abiding and Zenlike qualities of the tramp some sentimentality is quite appropriate And the music is choreographed totally in sync with the plot actionProduction design is sparse and at times drab That the film was made during the Great Depression is beyond obviousComedy here is simple and effective The main character expresses heart and humanity The little tramp is an unforgettable character And City Lights is a wonderful film,10
807,tt0021749,Chaplin was a unique presence in the history of the early cinema  Coming up through the ranks he gradually achieved a godlike stature being awarded total control of every facet of the productionNot only was he often the sole person who knew what the end product was to be as in The Kid but he was also allowed to elaborately improvise in the creative process  This often meant doing countless scores of retakes over days weeks and even months; holding up the cast and crew for days while he brooded over just what to do next; and even in the case of The Gold Rush cancelling expensive weeks of location shooting and returning to the studio to start all over againHe cleverly duped chief studio and bank chiefs into somehow going along with his freewheeling and gross inclinations thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hitandmiss schemes and trialanderror madnessIn other words Chaplin used the entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush with which he toyed at his pleasure to create his personal canvases  Fortunately he was a genius and at the right place in time to be allowed to get away with such unprecedented extravagenceIt was a young and growing industry when Chaplin began emerging and there were no set rules  People were still trying to figure out just what could be done with the medium  and Chaplin helped to establish its early parametersHe was certainly and autocrat yet that doesnt really matter when it comes to film works  Its the product that counts  In the case of City Lights all the bloodsweatandtears that it took to achieve the finished product was more than worth the effort  Now that all the frustration anger and outrage associated with the behindthescenes unfoldment of this highly troubled production are well in the past what remains is a genuinely moving film classic,10
808,tt0021749,The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one The first fulllength talkies were released in  By  theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business By  silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism But in  a new silent picture was released that far from being an embarrassing failure became the fourthhighest grossing picture of the year being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy The picture was City Lights and its producer writer director editor composer and star was Mr Charlie ChaplinChaplin was of course primarily a comedian and his humour was of broad appeal but audiences of the time were not exactly starved of easy comedy The Marx Brothers were making great strides on the verbal quipping front and the everpopular Laurel and Hardy had made a successful transition to sound What makes Charlie stand out and what gave him a level of accessibility that allowed him to continue with his slapstick antics well into the sound era is his equal devotion to story which allowed him a scope for social commentary empathetic characterisation and deep poignancy Of all Chaplins silent pictures City Lights is probably his least memorable in the funny stakes The number of classic gags here is fairly small Not since The Kid a decade earlier has Chaplin given story so much precedence City Lights is riddled with coincidence and plot contrivance but its a tale of such beauty and sincerity that this does not matter Within this story the comedy becomes functional often serving to puncture a schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone Ironically it is the occasional forays into slapstick that help keep City Lights realAs if to snub the talkie City Lights is a remarkable achievement in complex visual narrative even only occasionally relying upon title cards and then often only as an embellishment to the more comedydriven moments Most plot points and character traits are implied rather than stated which gives the picture a continual smoothness – another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad to see the back of the intrusive title card Out of necessity Chaplins technical approach is more overt than his usual He often cuts to a closeup to give us a necessary reaction and there are even some whippans in the scene where he and the flower girl first meet but all of this is in keeping with the rhythm and tone of the picture Those whip pans after all reflect an abrupt emotional moment and are in no way a blatant or showy manoeuvreBut what really makes City Lights work what makes it connect is the man himself on the screen Those additional closeups once a rarity for a man who acted mainly with his body now show off a capability for intense facial acting An older more meditative Chaplin may have been keeping the traditions of silent cinema alive but his own career trajectory was entering new ground where emotional expression was increasingly intimate and personal The result is profoundly moving,10
809,tt0021749,City Lights is a different film from what I am used to seeing I have not watched a Silent film or pantomime in a few years I really enjoyed the story that Charles Chaplin helped to create and produce for our enjoyment The plot seems to be commonly used now with a boy falling in love and trying to win the girls love in return In City Lights there are a few twists to the plot The girl is blind and poor the TrampChaplinis poor in love and wants to help the blind girl The Millionaire can help the tramp out by giving him money but he is an onagain offagain friend depending on whether or not he is drunkBeing that this is a silent film there is more importance on the use of props and the acting of the character Since in a silent film they cant tell us how they are feeling it is important that we can understand feelings through action This may be through facial expressions body language dress eye contact kinds of touch or the use of written statements like title cards in a silent film A prop that stood out to me was the use of flowers From the flower girl selling her flowers to how Chaplin was always holding or smelling one of the flowers from his special girl the use of flowers helped show the emotions and feelings of the two characters It symbolized the affection he had for her because like the flowers she couldnt see she couldnt see the true him or his true affections Another prop that was used was money From the millionaires point of view money was really of no matter He threw a party just because he had been reunited with his friend he went out to the dance club and when Chaplin needed money in order to help the flower girl pay for rent and surgery he was willing to give him one thousand dollars To the millionaire this money is nothing but to Chaplin and the flower girl this is a showing forth of love and charity When the movie was made in the s many people were poor and hopeless but the portrayal of Chaplin as a poor but happy and hopeful man might have given hope to others who watched this movie during the Depression In the film I noticed the use of a repetition or rather a parallelism as was read in the Film Art book dealing with The Wizard of Oz They show shots one way in Kansas and then reverse the shot in Oz as I saw in City Lights In City Lights parallelism is done with sight not necessarily with eyes but with the mind We see the reverse where the poor blind girl sees Chaplin as a millionaire and then at the end she sees him as the tramp he is with her new eyesight The true reverse is emphasized because she is now working in a shop and making money The two characters are somehow always at perceived opposite ends of the social class spectrum yet he still has a desire for her to be happy because of his love Another reverse is the happy friendly drunk millionaire who sees Chaplin as his friend and hero for stopping him from committing suicide However when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him throws him out and even has him arrestedIn a way this film is different then what our generation might be used to but by watching these classics we can better learn where the movies we love today came from and gain a better appreciation for the art of film,7
810,tt0021749,The tramp tries to nurture and help a blind flower girl regain sight despite scant resources and the prejudices and graft of the big city Although the physical gags lack the largescale invention of the factory scenes in Modern Times and the criticism of the wealthy doesnt transcend an admittedly witty recurring jokethe aristocrat friend can only demonstrate compassion and friendliness in an inebriated state; hes always inviting the tramp in only to incredulously throw him out the next sober morningthe tramps touching earnestness in rescuing his angel from a life of abjection is simple and selfless and deeply moving I would say it also fades out at the perfect moment of openended ambiguitythe viewer is forced to make resonant meaning out of the final troublingly cathartic shot even as the film articulates a consistent worldview in relation to what has come before In my eyes Modern Times is Chaplins masterpiece but City Lights would probably better merit repeat viewings which is as much a testament to the films power as anything else,8
811,tt0021749,City Lights is probably one of the most well loved along with Modern Times Chaplin movies The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp one of the most lovable truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps like they are labeled lazy and troublesome It is very hard to hate The Tramp because he gives so much when he has so little He spends his time and money giving to people  whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl Undoubtedly we all have a little bit of The Tramp in usThe plot is as follows the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street She is poor and by a mere coincidence believes that The Tramp is rich He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide and despite his gratefulness doesnt remember the poor tramp unless he is drunkCity Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history Its poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy I believe it is a strong mixture of both and a great balance of the two Both comedic and touching City Lights should not be missed by anyone,8
812,tt0021749, its perhaps a test of a persons outlook to ask them what they see in the final scene If theyve never seen City Lights before and they instantly notice the major continuity issue Chaplin holds a flower to his lapel from the rear shot its up to his mouth on his close up then maybe theyve placed film studies over romanceIt took a few viewings before I spotted this and once I did I cant help but notice it Yet even despite this I never fail to get choked up on the beauty of that final scene If you want to impress the right kind of girl put it on and show her what a sensitive soul you are during those final momentsAs for the rest of the film then while the final five minutes are classic and perhaps the best thing Chaplin ever did the rest of it is episodic and patchy necessitating my relatively low score Still a fine film but never a completely great one what presages those beautiful final moments is merely fine entertainment,7
813,tt0021749,If i have to choose which movie have the best ending it is very easy to choose city lights it is very very easy Chaplin was genius seriously genius This is the movie that truly inspire me After i watch city lights i just know there is such a movie power that exist in this world that can move and touch me really deep I never feel such a sharp sensation ever from any hundred movies i watch before and this movie pierce me through the heart within silent only gesture eye contact and cameraworks with no dialoguesometimes i try to analyze deeply why this movie have such a magnificent power i think the reason is the connection between scenes if we ask ourself what makes a good ending ? maybe the answer is how good you make the scene before the ending how good you correlate the prologue and epilogue and also between them how you fill the midduration of a movie if the director took a right decision a movie will not have any wasted scenes its only genius filmmaker can do and chaplin is one of themsilent movie such as city light is a hardkind of movie to made it needs next level of acting skill from the actors and actresses because there are no dialogue in it and most of the duration this movie is flawless in casting and the ending scene were unbelievable and unpredictable maximum genuine artbeauty of silent moviei recommend everybody to watch this movie at least once this movie is special it definitely will pierce you,10
814,tt0021749,As always the little tramp is fleeing the long arm of the law when he is mistaken for a wealthy man by a blind girl selling flowers by the roadside While he longs to help her the tramp knows he cannot However when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon a drunken man who he helps out who may be able to help him in turn  if the two of them can sober up long enoughIn response to seeing some modern trash posing as comedies recently Little Man Norbit Pluto Nash  Im looking at you I decided to check out some comedies that have stood the test of time  a few Chaplin films being among them City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start As was often the case this film has a thin narrative but one that allows for several scenarios for Chaplin to work his magic And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole filmThe statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at His support do no more than that  support him  but yet they are also roundly good Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character while Myers Garcia Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside ChaplinCity Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent setpieces that tickle and also stick in the mind So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead,0
815,tt0021749,Do you really need to post a spoiler warning for a movie that as of tonight is  years old?I havent read other reviews so forgive me if I repeat any previous postings City Lights is with nary a doubt the greatest love story ever told Forget Casablanca Forget An Affair to Remember Forget Love Story For the love of Christ forget Love Story This is a movie about the purest loveWe have the simple ubiquitous Tramp He is smitten with a blind flower girl who has mistaken him for a wealthy man There is a new operation that cures blindness and the Tramp will do anything to help Flower Girl regain her sight He tries to win a boxing match in which he is clearly outclassed In an era that is forgotten in modern times pun gleefully intended he cleans the streets of dung One of the best sight gags in screen history happens when the Tramp has to clean up after an elephant Finally he steals from a wealthy man to get the money he needs to pay for Flower Girls operationAnd then after he has spent many years in prison the Tramp is reunited with Flower GirlMy fellow males this is a wonderful Chick Flick If your lady friend isnt reduced to tears by the last  minutes of this movie you need to find a new lady Ive seen it a dozen times and it always gets to me,0
816,tt0021749,Four years into sound Charlie Chaplin wrote performed directed and scored one of films finest masterpiecesThe story is about the Little Tramp befriending a blind woman who mistakenly thinks he is rich Along the way he manages to get into a series of unintentional fixes with a large cast of foils at his disposal as he struggles to finance an operation for the womanIn an incredible display of comic talent Chaplin bombards the audience with scene after scene of magnificently choreographed comedy Drunk dancing or boxing his graceful slapstick is a rare combination of comedy and beauty a comic ballet Chaplins performing artistry as well as his ideas reach their apex with City Lights where only Chaplin would dare to challenge the naturally progressive trend and technological status quo by daring to make a silent By pulling it off with aplomb he solidified his place atop the history of the profession Some sound is used sparingly brilliantly with a statue dedication and a piano keyboard but no intelligible words are uttered The track and Chaplins score is lyrical energized and integral The film is perfectly constructedIn the masterful hands of Chaplin he avoids bathos in his scenes with the blind woman by severing the sentimentality and the scene with a comic moment saving it all for the incredibly touching and moving finale Up until then it is a display of comic genius that only a handful of others might lay claim to,10
817,tt0021749,As much as I loved The Kid The Gold Rush Modern Times and The Great Dictator City Lights is the film I consider Charlie Chaplins masterpiece And there are several reasons why this is so for meI love how City Lights is filmed once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets The music is also a delightthough my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times with plenty of themes that stuck in my head while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand The comedy is brilliantly done the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin moviealong with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator but ever in a comedy while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girlplayed touchingly by Virginia Cherrill he falls in love with And I also found the closeup climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity Chaplin is superb his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with CherrillOverall yet another Chaplin masterpiece yet for me this is the best of them all / Bethany Cox,10
818,tt0021749,Charlie Chaplin made some extremely funny shorts but of his longer films this is one of the best along with The Gold Rush and Modern Times Two stories are woven together One is Charlies onagain offagain friendship with a wealthy drunk The guy has a case of multiple personality When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts When hes sober he doesnt recognize Charlie at allThe second story involves a pretty blind flower girl who given certain distances angles and lighting resembles Uma Thurman Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballsCharlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy hes sober and wont support Charlies story Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel broke and bitter he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands The happy endingTheres sentimentality in the story of course There often is in Chaplins later films But as usual its somehow tempered Here its undercut by ironyWhen Charlie meets the wealthy toff the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope Hes about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes gives him a pep talk and changes his mind His spirit revived the rich guy spread his arms to the sky dropping the boulder that falls on Charlies footAnd when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl shes enthralled by his gentleness Unseen by her the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain himself enraptured Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlies face Well its not the blind Mr Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W C Fields general store but what is? A note There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film not counting the DempseyTunney debacle but I dont think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed hereIts hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this Black and white and silent Applause please,8
819,tt0021749,City Lights  **** out of Charlie Chaplin returns as The Tramp and this time he falls in love with a blind girl Virginia Cherrill and sets out to help her The Tramp eventually meets a suicidal drunk Harry Myers and their friendship leads to what might eventually help the girl he lovesChaplin made great films before and after CITY LIGHTS but for my money this here is his greatest film as well as one of the greatest films ever made Not only is it one of the funniest movies ever made but Id also argue that its one of the greatest love stories if not the greatest It really says a lot when a movie can conqueror two genres at one time but CITY LIGHTS is simply one of the greatest movies ever madeI think it says a lot that you get one classic scene after another and theres really not a weak spot to be found here Being  it took some real guts for Chaplin to deliver a silent film and I think he knew that he had to deliver something special because people had moved onto sound He certainly delivered something special as this here was easily the funniest film he had made up to this point The opening sequence with the introduction of The Tramp was priceless and we got one hilarious scene after another from that point The scenes with the drunk are downright hilarious as is another scene where The Tramp is trying to eat but without much success The cigar sequence is a masterpiece as is the by the water In fact the story between The Tramp and the drunk would have made a terrific movie on its own Just like the stuff with The Tramp and the blind girl would have made a perfect film Whats so special is that you get both stories wrapped up in one and it really deliversChaplin played The Tramp countless times but he was never better than he is here Just check out the timing in countless scenes including the boxing match and you cant help but be impressed with the actor Myers also deserves a lot of credit as the drunk as his timing has to match that of Chaplin throughout and the two men do a wonderful job together Then youve got Cherrill who wasnt a professional actor but the director makes her shine throughoutCITY LIGHTS contains one great scene after another and all of the laughs lead up to one of the most powerful endings in film history Theres really not enough great things that can be said about this film as it continues to get better with each passing year,0
820,tt0022100,Fritz Langs highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement and ended in the United States in  with the production of The Big Heat a film noir classic Perhaps his greatest film M Germany  forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones Even though M was Langs and Germanys first sound film many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late s While most early talkies return films to their static visually monotonous stage imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium M avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous offscreen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue The films editing particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling Of course many of the films sound effects are also imaginative and memorable none more so than the compulsive whistling of the films central character the stalker and serial killer of little girls Hans Beckert magnificently played by Peter Lorre Sound is also an important contributor to Ms rich and influential use of off screen space One famous example is the scene that introduces Beckert as a shadow against his own Wanted poster creepily intoning to his next victim Elsie Beckmann You have a very pretty ball Not only is Beckerts shadow a bow toward Langs expressionist artistic roots but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image  that is among us the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuousappearing albeit monstrous member Another example of Langs use of offscreen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is Elsies absence from them an empty chair at the Beckmann dinner table the vertiginous stairwell down which Elsies mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughters arrival the attic play area that awaits Elsies return from school Most memorable of all  and most often alluded to visually in other films  is the series of shots that indirectly record Beckerts assault and murder of the innocent child representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of Elsies ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame Never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated imagesBeyond its technical brilliance the keys to Ms lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of Hans Beckerts twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and trial Unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer Beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath Nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clearcut To be sure the gutreaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry capture Beckert and bring him to a mock formal trial whose conclusion is foregone Like many in America today Beckerts accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the monster in the surest way possible a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible Considering the heinousness of Beckerts crimes and the imperfections of a legal/medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again this emotional response is hard to resist Yet M is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism  quite the contrary Through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of Beckerts unkempt court appointed defense attorney and Beckerts own impassioned monologue Lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others guilty or not in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding Nazism in s Germany That the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks dresses and gestures like a Gestapo officer is no accident Moreover the letter M chalked on Beckerts back by one of his pursuers not only stands for murderer but also alludes to Gods marking of Cain While the popular misconception holds that the mark of Cain symbolizes his evil it in fact represents Gods warning to Cains flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance but to leave justice in Gods hands Translated into secular terms and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame Gods hands in M belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try Hans Beckert in the name of the Law,10
821,tt0022100,M /  **** 	M is a cinematic masterpiece of visual drama The stunning performances define the careers of exceptional actors such as Peter Lorre and Gustaf Grundgens Director Fritz Lang gives depth and dimension to his production by distinctly capturing the ecstasy of the films many characters and focusing accurately on individual situations This is an intriguing journey into the mind of a psychotic child murderer blending terror complexity and malignity in one amazing motion picture	Screenwriters Paul Falkenburg and Adlof Jansen construct the characters of M with distinctive personalities and three dimensional emotions Many lesser filmmakers give their characters no creativity outside the confines of the script In this movie each individual character has a mind of their own; they are free to roam the landscape of a inviting atmosphere	Fabricating such an impressive atmosphere is some of the best cinematography and lighting effects that I can remember watching This resplendent component creates the films terrific moody ambiance Suspense is one thing M contains in full context The movies third act is sheer peakhigh tension	Shot in black and white M stars Peter Lorre as PeterHans Beckert an extremely disturbed child murderer in the process of wreaking havoc on a neighborhood Parents everywhere are living in fear of their children being kidnapped and abruptly annihilated 	This picture contains a brilliantly crafted setup The visual setting creates a strongly developed opening Every scene works to either complicate the initial problem or propels the story through a firm narrative through line	The film captures the chaos of the town in terror perfectly M is more about the results of a serial killer than an actual serial killer Never do we directly witness a murder; the violent encounters are implied This method of film making perhaps makes the movies impact even greater With an creative perspective through a third person point of view the filmmakers repeatedly give us examples of a solid structure through characters and occurrences 	M offers a unforgettable challenging performance by Peter Lorre This extraordinary actor is tormenting and disturbing without embracing in extreme violent conduct He perspires with momentum and rapture This productions closing scenes are so deeply penetrating they entirely captivate the viewer Isnt this what movies are supposed to do?,10
822,tt0022100,M is a monumental film and seriously should be watched by all For a film like this to be made in  is just shocking Even if the film was released today it would still be nothing like we have seen before In our modern age of film making there has been a considerable rise in the production of films about serial killers their complexities and particularly about pathological ones Yet M is the first movie that comes to my mind when I think of the themes that have been in Psycho Silence of the Lambs Seven and not to mention countless moreThe film is lead by Peter Lorre in a transcending performance who plays the serial killer and rapist in which the film is centered around In this performance Lorre is successful in something that at the very least is rare to see in any kind of film compassion for a child killer and rapist Lorre makes the viewer see that he is not a criminal by choice but by a sickness of compulsion Too often then not is our perception of a psychotic killer having that look that puts fear into his or hers victims eyes Lorre doesnt do that but rather displays a frightened man a scared man One in which his desperation leads to his hazardous behavior His portrayal of a killer is not of a fearless one but of one consumed by fear Something that even today we as a people cannot understand let alone in The direction and writing of Fritz Lang is beyond comprehensible as he taps into the mind of a serial killer and his complexities He does so in such that we get an empathetic and compassionate illustration of all sides of the story This in which by then end of the film all points of view are more then well delivered to the audience Fritz Lang here has simply created here a timeless masterpiece One that excels in its technical aspects and enlightens the audience on a topic that other films still have not yet to match M inI highly recommend this film for many obvious reasons and conclusions This film was created by one of the all time great directors in Fritz Lang Langs command for the screen is mesmerizing and a joy to witness and so on and so forth Yet much of this is mostly superficial and a waste of time to continuously state M as I mentioned before takes a strong and original stance on an issue that we as a society yet have not fully resolved This film may not give you THE answer on this issue but it may sway that moral compass of yours that lies inside of all of us,10
823,tt0022100,The economy austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound and precise filmmakers Lang a master of the German expressionist film shot his first talkie a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies It was a shocking idea for its time based on the reallife killer Peter Kurten headlined as the Vampire of DüsseldorfM is about a terrorized city and a plump little man with wide eyes often chewing candy who is a pathological childkiller unable to control his urge for killing The film embodies several Lang themes the duality between justice and revenge mob hysteria the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in and for probably the first time in the cinema it adds a new dimension to suspense pity For the killer is clearly mentally sick He cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease and yet we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal rather than treated as a sick man Early in the film the killer is heard whistling the Grieg theme from In the Hall of the Mountain King This theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace And when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window the melody on the soundtrack told us chillingly that the murderer is there just out of sightThe Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since Casablanca The Maltese Falcon and The Mask of Dimitrios When the photographs of his victims all little girls are shown to him he jumps back and twitches with horrorWith powerful visuals Langs motion picture is Lorres first film His performance as the corpulent hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion Lorre is the archetypal outsideroutside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal He had only twelve lines of dialogIn the most famous of all about a pathological killer  Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho  Anthony Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy Psycho reeked with blood and horror whereas the suspense of M is subtle A childs balloon without an owner a rolling ball are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed The audience trapped in its seats torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight,8
824,tt0022100,The first time I saw M by Fritz Lang I almost didnt know what to make of it I was overwhelmed by the power of the performances the staging of the scenes the locations and the power that the simple story had with such complex circumstances Then I saw it again and a third time and I know that this is one of the best films ever to come out of Germany its a powerful statement about protecting our children if youre looking at it as a message movie but in reality it is just a piece of cinema heaven Thrillers today only wish they could draw a viewer into the mystery elements and have such unconventionality of the times Boiling down to this M is about a child Killer  the legendary character actor Peter Lorre in his first major role  who snatches children when their parents dont watch and continues on until an investigation goes underway But as the police investigate overly thoroughly into the real criminal underworld they know something is up that this is someone far more gone than they could ever be so they join in the hunt This all leads to one of the supreme dramatic climaxes in any thrillerOn the first viewing I just went straight for the story which is able to suck one in enough to make you feel dizzy But on the multiple viewings it becomes even more interesting as one can study the intricacy and indeed fullon artistry of Langs camera He puts it in unusual places at times and adds for good measure shades of dark and gray in many of the night scene this is by the way a precursor to filmnoir which Lang later became an important director in the s and s On top of this there is a very modern sense of style in the editing I remember a couple of scenes that surprised me editing wise One is where the cops I think it was the cops have an argument about the investigation two of them get into a shouting match and we get medium closeups of them going back and forth This is done quickly with a kind of intensity that isnt even captured in todays thrillers There is also the hunt for Lorre in the digging of the house where Lang cuts around constantly heightening the tension between the predators the criminals and the prey Lorre until its almost too much to takeThe disturbing aspects of the story of child abduction and murder have become benchmarks of a number of todays thrillers where the cop is usually the subject and the killer left more in the shadows in cat &amp; mouse style This doesnt happen here and because of it by the time we get to the final scene with Lorre being interrogated and giving his I cant help it speech it becomes something poetic tragic frightening Lang doesnt leave his message so simplistically he makes sure we know Lorres side too however twisted it has become and the antagonist is shown as human as opposed to these presentday thriller where the killers are barely given one dimension let alone two There were reports that during filming Lang put Lorre through torture ultimately causing the two to never work together again But nevertheless out of this comes a towering performance of a small wildeyed criminal in the midst of an extremely welltold and unpredictable mystery story In short if you dont know what youre in for when you hear that whistle those several infamous notes you may not at all,10
825,tt0022100,The opening scene of this movie is the first clue to its near perfection  A mother preparing dinner for her child waiting anxiously for her to return from school  Her hope and then distress as she hears people pass outside her door  While down in the streets of Berlin her daughter is receiving a balloon from a strange man in a long black coat  We know whats going to happen but its still horrific to watchFritz Lang you cinematic god!  A simple story of the underworld the police and a single man holding an entire city hostage and done with such precision and prenoir darkness that is oozes creepy suspense from beginning to endBut this movie is not so simple as the police inspectors trying to catch a devious murderer  its about the mob employing its network of beggars and petty thieves also trying to bring the killer to their own brand of justice Apparently the police crackdown caused by the murders is bad for business  so the mob begins to track him down as wellIts not only a great crime story and perhaps the first physiological thriller the murderer is schizophrenic but theres comments to be made here about the nature of justice and who should best dispense itIn all not only a trailblazing classic but THE trailblazing classic,10
826,tt0022100,This is a very interesting film on so many levels Its interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture  Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place  what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding Compare it with any American film from  and you cant help but see the differenceThe murderer artfully played by Peter Lorre has been killing children that have no link to him personally for months The police despite all of their efforts are unable to catch him mainly because there is no rhyme or reason in his choice of victims At first there is a focus on the victims and the hole left in their families by their killing Then the film shifts to two normally opposed groups  the police and the underworld After several months of no results by the authorities the police are unhappy because it reflects badly upon them and the underworld is unhappy because their activities are being disrupted because of the police doing constant raids in their efforts to capture the killerIn a particularly welldone part of the film the scene shifts back and forth between a conference of police and one of the underworld They discuss how they are going to catch the killer The police settle upon the idea of looking for people with a history of past mental problems that were pronounced cured and released The underworld decides to enlist an invisible group  the beggars  to follow every child at all times and therefore catch the killer Both groups focus on the right suspect the question is  who gets there first? M is a fascinating film that raises many topics  the death penalty a group of criminals that are criminals by choice causing less stress on society than a lone criminal that acts out of an uncontrollable compulsion and the motivations of the authorities often being their own bureaucratic survival rather than the larger issue of ending a series of horrible acts against humanity,9
827,tt0022100,Being a huge fan of German Expressionist art Im naturally drawn to the films of Fritz Lang  I recently was able to see the restored version of Metropolis on the big screen and was delighted to see M on the Sundance channel  especially since it was the uncut version  M follows the trail of a child killer Peter Lorre sought both by the police and the members of the underworld whose businesses are being effected by the investigation ,8
828,tt0022100,This movie is definitely one of the scariest movies Ive ever seen Its about this childlike pity evoking man brilliantly played by Peter Lorre who also happens to be a psychotic child killer The city in which he lives is of course panicked by the mysterious childkillings and both the criminals and the police starts to haunt the man down I wont reveal more then this but I will say this Just because its an old movie dont let your guard down This movie is one of those rare movies which are so good that youll never forget them,10
829,tt0022100,In an eerie propagandist fashion the phrase in the name of the Law is repeated over the last two scenes of Fritz Langs M as a child killer is brought to justice If L represents the State and the Law then M is meant to represent the Individual who in this case is a Murderer Lang boldly asked us way back in  whose rights come first the State or the Individual? A master of his craft Lang leaves the question openended and lets the audience decideM is shockingly contemporary in its psychological complexities It explores the psychology of individualism vs group think while showcasing how a state of fear can be inflicted upon a populace when a government fails to protect society from a single individual terrorizing the people The story is fairly straightforward An elusive citizen begins killing innocent children in a large nameless German city The media fuels a paranoid frenzy that incites the public The clueless police begin to raid the underworld after the populace is turned into a raving mob because of the failure to capture the killer The underworld comes to a screeching halt as their business is ruined by the police and starts their own manhunt for the killerUnlike a modern period piece that attempts to evoke a certain place and time M WAS a certain place and time Lang in an almost prophetic sense captured the state of mind of the German people in  as the Weimar Republic was on the brink of collapse and the Nazi Regime was preparing to take over When individuals live in a state of fear as they do in M society collapses and the Individual is crushed Only the State it seems can bring orderM is a also a masterpiece for its technical aspects The way in which Lang uses his camera to move through windows capture shadows reflections empty spaces and shift pointsofview is staggering even by todays standards He also played with the new technology of recorded sound with extensive voiceover narration and dialogue used to overlap and transition between scenes Didnt critics recently praise Michael Clayton for utilizing just such a technique as if it was something revolutionary? One can also see a protean style the would eventually birth the Film Noir movement with the creation of tension and suspense in the use of shadows and camera anglesYet M is not perfect It has some major flaws There are no real characters in the film to speak of in the modern sense The film is virtually all built around mood and plot The only time Lang invites us to emotionally connect is in the opening and closing scenes with a mother of one of the victims and in the classic scene of Peter Lorre giving his writhing and primal I cant help it! speech in front of the kangaroo court of criminals The mothers grief and Lorres madness are presented so sparsely and in such a raw form that it becomes too painful to want to connect with them Another flaw that is often overstated about films from this time period is the slow pace of the early police procedural scenes These inherent flaws combined with the inherent brilliance of Langs vision make M one of the most challenging films a modern viewer could ever sit throughWhat impressed me most about M was the subtlety of the symbolism Lang created with his haunting images As harrowing as the story is none of the gruesomeness is shown on screen Its all transmitted to the viewer through the power of suggestion Is it any wonder Hitler wanted Fritz Lang for his propaganda machine which thankfully led to Lang fleeing to America? Ill never forget the wide shots of the kangaroo court and the looks on those peoples faces as the killer is brought down the steps for trial or the vast expanse of that empty warehouse The scene of the ball rolling in the grass with no one to catch it the balloon caught in the telephone wires and the empty domestic spaces the mother has to inhabit after her child has been murdered are the types of scenes that tape into Jungian archetypes and shared fears The look on Lorres face as he confesses the hand of the Law coming down to save Lorre from being lynched and the ghastly plea from the mother in the final scene will stick with me for the rest of my life M is a communal nightmare; one that from which we have yet to awake,10
830,tt0022100,This is one of those movies that will stay with you for the rest of your life  The characters are ugly and disturbing there is nothing cute in this movieThere are constant parallelisms drawn between the police and the underworld and the common way in which they operateWe also get to journey into the mind of the madman  If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs you should see this alsoOf course you must be patient enough to deal with subtitles and the fact that this is a very old movie  one of the first talkies  But most viewers will get something out of the dialogue even without knowing the German language,10
831,tt0022100,Great story with incredible development of ideas and feelings while giving the audience an indepth perspective for each side to an extremely difficult issue to resolve  Every film lover should take the time to see this film for its ingenious style and execution of ideas  Adds a little comedy in interesting ways to help entertain and engage the audience  Acting is incredibly real and heart felt  Dramatic and tender to fit to any interest,0
832,tt0022100,This movie is so intense and enthralling it doesnt have to hide from even the most amazing Actionmovies But unlike the most actionmovies it really has a story to tell with a very interesting conclusion at the endWhen people talk about Fritz Lang they always talk about Metropolis but I think this is his masterpiece This movie MUST HAVE inspired pretty much every police movie or show ever made Rarely have I rated a movie a  with more confidence than this oneEND OF REVIEW so I dont have anymore lines but they make me write  lines apparently so Im writing this I know a joke ehm well its not a good one so I will quote GEORGE BESTI spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars The rest I just squandered,10
833,tt0022100,Watching Fritz Langs M is watching the history of cinema unfold before ones eyes Made in the transition period between the silent and sound film this  masterpiece remains fascinating for several reasonsFirst of all the use of sound is impeccable Suffice to say the killer in the movie is caught is through identifying his trademark whistling But the use of voiceover narration was also new at the time and is used here very well first when a mother calls in panic for her missing child and her name echoes across several empty walls Next in a scene in which two detectives elaborate on what theyve done to apprehend the killer and everything they say is matched by an imageSecondly few times has a serial killer been treated with such complexity compassion and straightforwardness in cinema Peter Lorre plays a child murder a man who acts by impulse possibly a schizophrenic He simultaneously evokes horror and pity and hes too distant from the supercool and erudite serial killers of today Lorre plays one Hans Beckert a lonely man with a history of mental illness an ordinary man without any qualities or amazing traitsThirdly its a powerful meditation on vigilantism and crime The police is unable to capture the killer so Berlins underground decides to capture the criminal The police raids are putting them out of business and they resent the fact that a child killer is being sought amidst their ranks The absurdity of bank robbers and card cheaters with a sense of morals is not lost on the filmmakers In a mocktrial at the end these same criminals think they have the authority to sentence the child murder to death But as he tells them if they wanted if they got jobs and worked honestly they could leave their lives of crime; a man whos ordered by voices to kill cant just turn off him impulsesBut above all M is a fascinating exciting thriller Its an intelligent crime story that shows police and criminals working on different sides and with different means to achieve the same purpose If one can laugh at the idea of a criminal union realism should never be a criterion for judging art one cant laugh at the policemen in this movie Inspector Lohmann played by Otto Wernicke is one of most intelligent detectives ever to grace cinema Hes fat hes cranky hes an unlikely hero but hes shrewd he can read a persons personality at a glance hes patient Lang must have liked him too because he used the character and actor in his following crime epic The Testament of Dr Mabuse in which Lohmann shows even greater skillsI knew or at least highly expected that M would be an amazing movie But I didnt imagine a yearold movie would hold up so well in terms of cinematography sound pacing acting structure Few movies achieve such a synthesis of qualities There is no doubt on my mind that M deserves the recognition it continues to receive from film historians,10
834,tt0022100,In my opinion this is just an OK film Except for some little stylistic tricks there is nothing special The story is OK how it is told is rather weak in some parts its even ridiculous the acting is mostly very weak except for Lorre who you dont see much of anyway and the sound quality is horrible something you cant blame it for but I had to use HEADPHONES on full volume to even understand the words! but switching from sound to silent all the time is very distracting and has no dramatic effect at all even if some say so  the opposite is the case it seems very amateurish The slow pacing is typical for its time And suspense? I dont think so In my opinion the main reasons why this film is so critically acclaimed areA Lorres overacting Whenever overacting has a purpose its critically acclaimed And his acting as a madman is very effective B Id call it heavy look The topic seems heavy and the plot and style seem all too heavy and important You almost want the film to be successful so you search for it in Lorres acting As a justification so to say Im sure you like the film for many other reasons too Some more important reasons maybe But that doesnt mean Im wrong Its a film we want to like and where you dont want to look for the flaws Well long story short I dont think the final result is a success There is too much Average in it and the Great isnt all that great Metropolis Nosferatu Caligari Sunrise I think have all a more stunning look All silent and all made before M Dont get me wrong the cinematography is good and also inventive in little parts but not THAT revolutionary that it deserves the reputation it has Probably the flaws are too big for me to fully appreciate the rest Like every time one said He doesnt leave any marksblah blah I had to laugh He talks with the kids in the middle of the day in the middle of the street he walks along the streets with them he goes into shops buys stuff for them he makes mad gestures in public And then he also whistles this damn song all the time so loud you hear it from three streets away while everyone in the audience knows from beginning on that this will be his doom /,6
835,tt0022100,While many of the problems of early sound pictures lampooned in Singin in the Rain were more or less myths the early talkies did present a big challenge for filmmakers everywhere Europe however was at an advantage over Hollywood because even though it took them a few years to gain the same access to sound technology films from the US would be screened abroad only six months or so after their first domestic release Thus directors like Fritz Lang were able to witness Hollywoods first faltering steps with sound before giving it a go themselvesIts funny how sceptics dismissed sound as a gimmick because the best early uses of sound were those that treated it as exactly that – a gimmick Lang demonstrates in M that a talkie need not be an entirely new kind of motion picture; sound is merely another layer of technique Rather than getting bogged down in lengthy dialogue scenes Lang keeps his storytelling primarily visual and when he needs lots of expository dialogue he intercuts multiple scenes to keep the pace going This is not to say Lang is trying to ignore sound – in fact he uses it to enhance the picture sometimes having dialogue or other noises take place offscreen to focus us on reactions or causeandeffect Other times he ironically uses completely silence something of course you never get with silent pictures due to the continuous musical score giving a dreadful sense of eerinessAnd thankfully the best elements of Langs method have survived the talkie revolution His visual style is particularly effective here in provoking a chilling disturbing atmosphere Shot compositions with large blank areas give a sense of surreal starkness Characters often stare intensely straight at the camera aggressively drawing the audience into the films world Several times we are even dumped straight into the pointofview of the killer himself The fragmented narrative with its lack of lead characters and impersonal pointbypoint plotting could easily be boring but Lang holds our interest by keeping a dynamic sense of rhythm and telling the bulk of the tale through pure wordless imagery Langs German pictures in common with typical German cinema of the time feature highly melodramatic acting and exaggerated almost comical characters These figures generally suited the fantasies and comicbook stories of Langs silent days but Im not sure they sit so well with the closetohome setting of M Still these characters are somewhat more effective now that they have voices probably because most German screen actors of the day were from a stage background Peter Lorre was a shameless ham but thats what you need to play a psychopath and in any case hes a lot better here than in many of his Hollywood roles Otto Wernicke is also incredibly entertaining in the role of Inspector Karl Fatty Lohmann; again a stagy exaggeration but with some absolutely wonderful gestures and comic timingThere isnt a lot else I can say about M – it is one of those pictures that has been analysed to death – although I doubt any comment other than mine mentions Singin in the Rain in the opening line  While not quite Langs best picture I can think of few directors who made such a smooth transition from silents to talkies and sadly this was his penultimate German picture before the Nazis took over Theres no denying that Lang was wasted in Hollywood He did his best to understand it but by and large it never understood him I say by and large; the renowned Irving Thalberg was reportedly bowled over by M and screened it to many of his writers and directors as inspirational material Had that prestigious and influential producer not died in  the same year Lang began working in Hollywood would things have turned out differently I wonder?,9
836,tt0022100,Masterpiece is the word most film buffs and historians probably would use to describe this  Fritz Lange film based loosely on the events of a reallife serial killer a few years prior to the film In this movie the killer is Hans Beckert Peter Lorre who lures children to their deathsThough the story is about a child killer the theme of M centers more on societys obsession with the murders From kids playing games to adults going about their everyday lives everyone is on guard suspicious combative and very vindictive For selfish reasons even the petty criminal underworld wants the child killer caught But the police are ineffective and a selfrighteous mob mentality takes over The whole film is really a study in the terrifying psychology of group thinkAs it turns out the killer is less monstrous than pathetic and compulsive Beckert cant help himself Hes a short squatty bugeyed little man who cant control the devil within Lorre was perfect for the role and his acting is flawless and mesmerizing Yes the killings all offscreen are awful But the militant lynchmob mentality is just as scary Beckert is the only individualist in the filmPart silent film and part talkie the B&amp;W visual style of M is wonderfully expressionistic and baroque There are lots of overhead camera shots Background sounds like honking horns and whistles are precursors of major plot pointsWhat strikes me most about this film is its tone I can think of very few films that are so harsh so bitter so malicious so punitive M contains not an ounce of humanism Langs exwife Thea von Harbou a Nazi sympathizer wrote the film just before the rise of Hitler The films angry militant tone thus foreshadows Hitlers Third Reich from  until  Lang himself fled Germany and ended up in the USYour own personal preferences in films will determine whether you consider M to be a masterpiece or overrated or perhaps somewhere in between But individual preferences aside there can be no doubt that M is an important film historically Every person who wishes to be versed in classic films needs to see M at least once,0
837,tt0022100,A serial killer who favors children Peter Lorre is on the loose in Berlin He is wanted by the police But even worse for him he is wanted by the Berlin underworld who have been targeted falsely by the police for being involved Watch out child killer! There is nothing bad I can say about this film The acting the directing the sound all perfect Many have praised Lang for his use of sound at a time when the practice was just coming into play And rightfully so Whereas other films have sound matching what is on the screen Lang realized he could use the effect to signify what he was not showing including the murderer who has a distinctive whistle Brilliant Not to mention that one key role is a blind beggar a man who cannot appreciate visuals but only sounds he is appropriately the man who can identify the killer! Basing the story loosely off of childmurderers of the day Grossman Haarman and Peter Kürten this is one of the darkest tales set to film up to this point There is no blood and no children are actually seen killed And the killer is relatively reserved compared to his reallife counterparts who were also rapists and cannibals He presents an interesting defense his crimes are less wrong than the crimes of others because he cannot psychologically control himself Or in modern terms not guilty by reason of mental defect Is a child killer less evil than a pickpocket? Is he in some way also a victim?I enjoyed the idea of a unionized underworld I do not know the reality of this as it seemed sort of comic and anticipated such villainous teamups as we might see in comic books But crime was certainly not unheard of and even black market meat existed and I am not sure if I really want to know what that meansMany including reviewer Stanley Kauffmann have noticed the similarity between M and Bertolt Brechts Threepenny Opera Sadly I have not seen Brechts work and cannot comment on the comparison German philosopher Theodor Lessing best known for his work on Jewish selfhatred may even have been an inspiration due to his work on Haarmann But regardless of inspiration Lang is the master here his work stands the test of time and today almost a century later is widely recognized as one of the greatest achievements on film At the least many consider it the alltime greatest German film And rightfully soThere are so many great shots including the socalled inventory shot of the criminal underworlds wares Lang also excelled with the camera angles using knives as frames and getting more than one great mirror shot I should also give credit to cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner who previously worked on Nosferatu and many others  his reputation should be second only to Karl FreundThere is nothing that beats the Criterion release with commentary short films and more I watched the film this way on DVD Perhaps a Bluray release has even more but I would not even know what could be added This disc is packed and a mustown for any film historian or Lang fan,10
838,tt0022100,Outstanding German expressionist film from Fritz Lang that follows first the police then the underworld as they search for a child killer in Berlin The cinematography is moody and dramatic as the story moves through the poorer sections of the great city and the acting while of a more melodramatic style than is currently popular is very good* Peter Lorre is outstanding as the killer who taunts the police as the noose slowly tightens around him To some extent the film is an early procedural drama as the police use then modern forensic techniques such as finger printing and graphology to try and find the killer Tired of the increased police surveillance the citys criminal element begins their own search mobilising the numerous beggars to be eyes on the street The film touches on a number of issues that are as relevant now as in the s including mob mentality men are accused of being the killer simply for talking to a child rights of the accused the end justifies the means use of torture and the ever thorny issue of mental health and culpability One of the great preWWII German films *I watched a subtitled version on TCM,10
839,tt0022100,M like Manichean? What can you say of a plot driven by criminals and where good people are rather inefficient for the most part and where the most despicable character earns our own sympathy This is a movie using such stark blackandwhite contrasts noir in its soul and gray in its coreM like Mob Mentality? Fritz Lang personal Jaccuse against a system where accusers arent all innocentM like Maturity? The film also consecrates German Expressionism as a peak of creativity and social relevance a sequence in history where Berlin became literally the best area and arena of expression to an art that had reached its maturityOr M like Mörder murderer in German Maudit in French doomed and Masterpiece in the universal language of cinemaM like Menace and MusicChildren are singing an elimination game of ominous undertones later we see little Elsie playing with the balloon a shadowy silhouette appears the face remains unrevealed while we hear the whistling of In the Hall of Mountain King Before the shark theme in Jaws to the Psycho shrieking violins the Peer Gynt tune became the first notable leitmotif meant to suggest an evil presence the perfect device to put us in the victims standpoint for the first act as powerlessly as the poor mother calling Elsie while her balloon the bait used by Hans Beckert is drifting along the telephone wiresThe effects are then shown through the growing fame of the new Jack the Ripper figure the ensuing paranoia with any adult basically talking to a child is assaulted The killer is a menace to an already crisisstricken society forcing the police department to triple the efforts psychiatric cases are explored handwriting analyzed and daily and nightly raids operated to make further pressure on the criminal worldM for Methodic For its second act M is the seminal police proceduralWhile covering that angle with a documentarylike precision Lang still seems dubious about the polices efficiency and provides an interesting twist by paralleling the work of the law with the outlaws In a long sequence where both sides brainstorm about the methods to use to find him we swing back and forth from one world to another and the only indicator of the side of the law were put in is the presence of uniform last time I saw criminals acting like politicians in a masterpiece it was in The Godfather One even points out insightfully that the killer must be a bourgeois because its the very standard of life that provides the level of idleness driving any easily corruptible mind to the most extreme cornersM like the sign on the shoulderSo in a famous sequence criminals helped by the street beggars find Hans Beckert quicker than the police force he was betrayed by his trademark whistling and irony a little girl who noticed the infamous letter marked on his shoulder The following chase takes maybe too much time for the films own good Not saying the film could do without the struggle to catch him but the court is such a high point of cinemas history that the previous part seems more forgettableAnd Peter Lorre with his round face innocent eyes when hes cornered like a rat and utters his memorable speech gives the performance of a lifetime as a living symptom a man incarnating the sickness of a society where bad people toy with justice and the worst of all acts as childishly as his victims claiming innocence with such rabid eloquence hes almost convincingBeckert says he cant control his impulses a little voice urges him to commit the irreparable acts and his body language is simply gutwrenching when he simply cant put words His lawyer makes a good point about the past of some accusers whose Becket call hypocrites because they could choose to be honest but the accusers retort that whether hes responsible or not hes still a menace Sure whether their reasons are selfish or ethical is debatable but can we empathize with Beckert?M like ModernityLooking at Twitter or Youtube or Facebook comments today you can tell theres something ferocious and still ongoing about mob mentality and a film like M could be deemed as feeble and liberal in the way it provides a tribune to a child molester the worst possible crimeM like MultilayeredYet there are some powerful truths hiding underneath the thriller the truth about a society sick of its own contradictions determined to impose standards of morality white and condemning true crimes black but indulgent toward activities that have no worse repercussion That the film ends with blackclad mothers admitting their own responsibility is perhaps the most optimistic thing about M the sentence doesnt matter what matters is the lesson behind but did German learn the lesson?Ironically one could have seen the rise of the Nazi empire as the antidote like Thea Von Sarbou who wrote the film and worked for the Nazi regime other could also see it as its worst possible consecration like director Fritz Lang That he didnt side with the criminals at the end emphasizes an intuitive comprehension of his world and allowed this film to be hailed as a true intelligent nightmarish and alas premonitory masterpiece with M as the mark of a disillusioned geniusM like Meditative? Mysterious? Mantic?Interestingly the French title is M le Maudit meaning the doomed one as if Beckert was the living incarnation of a doomed society as if there was indeed something rotten in the Weimar Republic and It wouldnt get any better after but could Fritz Lang anticipate it? Looking up his second masterpiece M I was wondering whether Lang reflected his own rejection of German society or cared enough to warn the audience against the impending doom of decadenceSurely the director behind Metropolis could only pinpoint with the accuracy of a soothsayer the limits of a civilization that might take its heritage for granted,9
840,tt0022100,This movie has it all! This is one of my alltime favorite movies Many people have criticized it because its from  and I say Who cares when you have such a great movie? Peter Lorre gives a  star performance as the child murderer and may I say he is very very haunting Fritz Langs direction is superb; the cinematography is superb! The kangaroo court scene at the end is my favorite part and its brilliantly done The plot is very well crafted Even more amazing is the plot focuses around catching the murderer but it is not boring for one second Each scene flows beautifully into the next with some amazing chases raids and facial expressions This is also a movie ahead of its time This is definitely one of the alltime best movies!,10
841,tt0022100,Fritz Langs second absolute landmark after the equally brilliant but completely different Metropolis and also his first opportunity to work with the wonders of sound And boy did he ever deliver a great piece of work! Like the M for murderer is marked on Peter Lorres coat the film M for masterpiece is branded on cinema history annals for all eternity Langs film is a triumph in every possible viewpoint and it covers a lot more genres and elements than just simply the manhunt for a childmolester*** SPOILERS ****The horrors M handles about is timeless and of all cultures but yet itll always remain a taboo subject and for that reason alone Fritz Lang deserves extra praising In an utterly astonishing way Peter Lorre portrays Hans Beckert a child murderer who singlehandedly terrorizes four and half million people simply by his uncontrollable urge to kidnap and molest young schoolgirls The grim and haunting atmosphere is terrifically built up by images of previous Beckertvictims and the disappearance a new unfortunate girl Her toy rolling of a remote hillsa balloon drifting away on the wind Really simple but extremely efficient methods to reflect the ominous actions that just took place Other than to focus on the further actions of the killer Lang turns to the effect this terror has on the city and how the manhunt for Beckert develops Our director is obviously fascinated by how a police procedure is organized and he serves the viewer a detailed overview of all the steps taken by the investigators Meanwhile he grabs the opportunity to forcefully criticize the medias influence and the German law system with both hands Id really like to stress that Langs subtle mockery was a really risky thing to do with the upcoming Nazireign so you cant admire him enough Due to the constant and fruitless raids the police are holding in the hope to capture the killer the criminal underworld begins to lose its profits as well and they start their own manhunt for the killer assisted by whores beggars and petty thieves With the carefully observing eyes all over town it becomes practically impossible for Becker to satisfy his monstrous needs The almighty Peter Lorre arrives late in the film every moment hes on screen is a moment worth treasuring His sad appearance and cruel testimony are sequences that leave no human being unmoved Lorre is a brilliant actor and this is inarguably one of the most impressive performances of all time M features constant tension outstanding dialogue and stunning camerawork As said before Fritz Lang had the opportunity to work with sound for this film and he immediately makes the most out of this This was the first big German production that featured sound and it STILL ranks as the title that made best use of itand that sure means something after more than  years Theres the chilling and legendary tune Lorre constantly whistles but also the absence of sound Lang uses to portray the besieged city As you can tell from the above review M is absolute mustsee and easily one of the most essential productions ever shot Its lightyears ahead of its time and still disturbing after all these years This film is a mesmerizing portrait about the darkest most alarming aspects of humanity and yet still it doesnt live up to reallife facts As you probably know the plot of M is based on the whereabouts of the serial killer Peter Kürten who brutally murdered many victims in the city of Düsseldorf I read a biography on Kürten recently and the true details of his crimes and animallusts go beyond every filmmakers wildest imagination,10
842,tt0022100,Since I loved Metropolis and was mesmerized by the great storyline of M I happily shelled out  euros to get the deluxe DVDset of Fritz Langs first talkie fully expecting I was going to view it over and over againWell that was  euros I should have spent on a new haircut or something This is a very boring film one that is only somewhat redeemed by a great Peter Lorre and an interesting final scene But the first hour was sooo slooow! Low point was a tenminute scene in which four boring men were having a roundtable about deciding what to do about the child killer No camera movement whatsoever just blabbering and no oneliners either Hes a killer for heavens sake  ACTION! DO SOMETHING! STOP HIM! Looking back maybe I was even more mesmerized by the brand M The film posters are great and that single M just makes for a classic even harrowing logoStill I honestly cant believe that a modern viewer would actually enjoy this,4
843,tt0022100,From the elongated opening scene of M you know you are in for more than a simple film could ever imagine The elongated lunch scene as a mother waits for her daughter to return as we audience members watch the daughter stray from her journey home with a stranger with a sharpened whistle It is foreboding it is depressing it is mesmerizing It has been a very long time since a film especially one made  years ago seemed so delicate so thought provoking so timeless as M does From these opening shots Lang lets us know that this isnt going to be your happy utopia where criminals are caught the next day by the police and our world goes back to liquorish and lollipops but instead a world where the locals collect like a mob and trust is thrown violently out of the window With excellent cinematography and a strong balance between humor and honesty Lang creates this visceral world where the line between truth and justice get blurred where good and evil are similar and a man defines his actions as uncontrollable This merely scratches the surface of M a masterful film that ranks amongst the best this world has offeredWhat makes M shoot ahead of anything modern anything by cult directors anything close to popular? It begins with the actors goes to the man behind the camera and finally the skillful craftsmanship of the story Each of these elements never lack never fall behind and constantly build upon each other until that final breath that encourages you to repetitively rewatch To begin Peter Lorre How could you not talk about M without mentioning this doeeyed murderer From the beginning we know his role in this film yet Lang pulls every emotion out of us as we follow his route We feel sympathy for Lorre when he is tried we feel scared when he is trapped in the attic we feel hatred when he voyeuristically looks at the children  and yet he isnt the only character in this film Lang introduces us to other well placed personas throughout The infamous Inspector Lohmann not to mention that great floorup shot is the perfect example of Langs impressions on the local German police The fact that Lohmann whistles counter productive to what Lorre represents only solidifies that idea To add to these already dynamic people we have the background criminals that decide to take the matter into their own hands in hopes to eliminate the looming police presence The Safecracker is idealistic of what Germany was to become the classic SS look with the idea of eliminating the opportunity to be tried in a true court of law Each one of these characters provide humor excitement and fullblown emotion to the screen adding to the overall impact to this film With Lorre already bedazzling us with his range and taut emotion it is up to Fritz Lang himself to ensure that edits angles and direction doesnt hinder the power of his actors Lang steps up to the plate and delivers with his avantgarde film making I use the words avantgarde because the techniques used in this film are far beyond  Lang incorporates powerful closeups amazing track following and shots nearly unseen at this time The overhead shots the ability to make the crowds look ravenous the camera puns adds just as much as another lead would If you were impressed by his ability in Metropolis M is only going to solidify that idea of Lang A favorite is the raid on the office complex by a group of criminals Every shot every detail is directed with ease but complexity It is easy to be in awe of this film but to take the time to see Langs ability behind the camera will take M to a whole new level Personally it is my belief that he announces himself with this film A pioneer of the camera a grandfather of what cinema is today  one cannot watch anything released today and not see Langs influences See Finchers Zodiac a nearly identical film in themes to what Lang was trying to produce hereFinally we have acting and direction but one must also credit the story for being not just creative and unflinchingly original but for supporting a strong message The idea of being more careful was impressive to watch due to the time being  a time well thought of that children could be anywhere without any worry The story brings evil into an American thought that good guys always prevail that suburbia is always safe and that the police actually do keep the streets safe The story of M challenges you as a viewer even today one could argue even more so today than in  With crimes continually on the rise in this country with the idea that pleading insanity cures the disease of murder or is an easy innocence the idea of M especially that final dialogue seems more important today The fascination also arises with the concept of the mob within this story  the horror that simple events kindness even could turn on anyone in a moment of panic Police arresting anyone that even looks at children in a peculiar way  a fascinating concept that Lang is not afraid to develop Imagine if this film were made two years later what a different theme Lang would have tackledA deeply enticing film Fritz Lang proves that he was a ground breaker in his field Not only could he handle Science Fiction but nearly every other genre imaginable M is no exception to his skill If you have not seen this film watch it  experience it  know what it means to be marked like Lorre Grade ***** out of *****,10
844,tt0022100,Im a fan of Peter Lorres and I love black &amp; white films  I enjoy foreign films  I even like trying to twist my brain around mindboggling symbolfilled convoluted art flicks  But I was incredibly disappointed in *M*It had a lot of potential but it kept drowning in itself  It took me a while to understand this  The plot itself wasnt overly complex  so why did I still have the feeling of unpleasant confusion  What I finally realized is that *M*s downfall is that it cant decide what it isI went into it with a general understanding of what it was going to be about and knowing Peter Lorres work I had certain expectations  The parts of the movie that were most satisfying to me were those which fit those expectations a tense shadowy atmosphere made all the more eerie and suspenseful by the skillful use of In the Hall of Mountain KingOther parts of the movie felt more like a police procedural  There is certainly a place for the Ed McBains of our world but that place is not being mixed in with Robyn Cook  These segments felt out of place and they jarringly interrupted the mood created by the spookier more emotionally taut scenesThe muchapplauded ending had the same problem for me it suddenly introduced yet another mood  that of introspection and social consciousness  This was too distinct from either of the other two moods to feel as if it were even part of the same pictureEach mood each theme each general strain could have been very good on its own  but as a package the film felt illblended  And as much as I enjoy paradox and even confusion they are not in of themselves sufficient criteria for a good film,3
845,tt0025316,Frank Capras idealistic outlook on life is evident in his films From It Happened One Night to Its a Wonderful Life Capra has always had a tendency to let the little guy rise above it all and beat the odds It is no small wonder that Capra enjoyed much of his success during the Depression when movies were used to truly pull an audience out of the despair of the s into a world where anything can happen where being a nice person is all you need to succeed While the fact that the country was in the middle of the Depression was not completely ignored an overly optimistic view on life was taken to counter the despair of everyday lifeThere were many points in It Happened One Night where the true state of the country was indicated Homeless people hitching rides on trains seemed perfectly normal Rather than regard them with apprehension and pity you smile and wave at them Another example is the hostile reaction proprietor Zekes wife had to the fact that her husband had let Peter and Ellie stay the night with promises of being paid Upon seeing Peter and Ellies car missing they rush to the cottage to see if Peter and Ellie are still there They cannot afford freeloadersIn another scene a childs mother has passed out from hunger because they have no money to buy food Peter and Ellie have nearly depleted their funds but decide that the mother and child need money more than they do and give some to themDespite these instances the movie was altogether cheerful in its depiction of the world In the throes of the stock market crash this movie signaled the birth of the screwball comedy At a time when the country needed release they could find that release and laughter in movies like It Happened One Night Audiences were amused by scenes in the film such as the segment in which Peter teaches Ellie how to dunk a donut Or when forced to share a room Peter puts a blanket between his and Ellies beds and calls it the `wall of Jericho which is revisited when the walls of Jericho come tumbling down after Peter and Ellies marriage Probably the most famous scene in the film is the hitchhiking sequence which features Peter standing by the roadside trying to thumb a ride unsuccessfully finally giving up after more than a dozen cars speed by without paying any heed to his attempts After he gives up beaten Ellie simply lifts her skirt above her knee The first car that passes stops as we see extreme closeups of a foot slamming down on the brakes and a hand applying the hand brakeA master in his profession Capra left his mark on the films he directed With an almost childlike cheerfulness he maintains a sense of dignity and class The viewer is left with a feeling of hope for humankind even if its only that a persons ideals could be used to make such a film Capras films are still regarded as masterpieces It Happened One Night arguably remains to this day unparalleled in screwball comedies It was one of many movies made during the Depression a sometimes sad and even lonely time in our history It gave its audience a chance to escape and forget their troubles for a few moments in time out of  stars,9
846,tt0025316,In his autobiography The Names Above the Title Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters the hero the heroine the comedian and the villainWhat Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films the characters of hero and comedian are combined Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself especially with that system all her own But in doing what he did for Clark Gables character Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the moldCapras autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio along the lines of Republic or Monogram As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it Capra also had a stroke of good luck Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day drunk as a skunk is priceless Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldnt have been more cooperativeAt some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day So the publicity drums were beatThe rest as they say is history It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam Best Picture Best Director Best Actor and Best Actress It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios And it set the standard for screwball comedyThe film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert Theyre together for most of the film so if it doesnt click between the two of them you have people walking out in droves Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in Gable and Colbert did only one other film together Boom Town for MGM You cant get much more different than those two films Boom Town had a huge MGM budget Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein Its also a great film but its not a classic like It Happened One Night,10
847,tt0025316,It Happened One Night directed by Frank Capra was made and released in  by Columbia Pictures as a small budget film that was not expected to do well at the box office Yet after its release the film gained many accolades and won the Academy Award for best picture in  Due to the original small nature of the film the leading man role was surprisingly filled by Clark Gable who was on loan from another studio He stared opposite of Claudette Colbert Capras film was a combination of many ideals emotions and social perceptions of the American society of the thirties but it was also a combination of many new and innovative filming techniques and sound advancements The film unfolds the story in such a attentiongrabbing and remarkable way that most of todays cinema use his style and ideals when producing and creating films Capra used the idea of a moving camera one that was not fixed upon a box but on a moveable crane instead This produced more sweeping shots more angles for filming and fewer distance shots It allowed for more movement of the actors as well as a more realistic and real life feeling to the movie The film also incorporates back projection of images This is were a scene is filmed previously and played in the background while the actors perform the scene in front of the projection Back projection is used for car scenes to give the impression that the actors are driving but in reality they are in a sound stage Capra also incorporated the use of a wipe in his film The technique of moving left to right and fading in or out to change a scene or show elapsed time took the place of the traditional place cards in silent films and allowed for a more constant stream for the film The film was also all talk the new technology of a sound strip on the side of the film was used The text cards of silent films were completely discarded Another camera trick by Capra is to show a change in feelings within Clark Gables character for Claudette Colberts character by depicting her character in a different light This happens two times within the film at key moments to the development of their relationship Claudette Colbert is seen in a close up of softer light to emphasize Clark Gables character seeing her in a `different light In this romantic comedy Capra not only showed new styles and techniques but also addressed social issues of the time Through comedy he showed the outlandish nature of the rich King arriving for his own wedding in a helicopter and the nature of man being the controller in relationships as well as in society The fighting and struggles between the two main characters showed the man taking care of the woman the social norms of how men and woman should act around each other in that era But the fighting and the banter also show a strongminded and intelligent woman The two strongwilled main characters balanced each other outCapras techniques for showing the social relationship between the rich and working classes as well as a relationship between man and woman in the s captured film makers and film viewers for over  years Films are now compared to his style of camera movement and his style of capturing the American ideals When movies of today make a similar statement of achieving what one wants they are referred to as Capraesc Capras imagination and style is one that changed the outlook of American films and introduced a new genre to film goers everywhere,0
848,tt0025316,IHON rightly earns its place as one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history A pioneer of the screwball comedy genre it holds up very well  years after it was madeIts a classic tale of the battle of sexes something that is still so relevant today We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Claudette Colbert who jumps ship from her fathers yacht literally! in Florida after an argument with said father played by Walter Connolly over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley Jameson Thomas without her fathers consent Ellie is on a mission to get to New York to King Westley But how will she do it? Thats how Peter Warne played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable comes into the story Recently fired from his newspaper job Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York and realizing who she is Her story is all over the news after all! offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story to win him back his job And so the fun begins Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances The trip isnt a smooth one and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie which gives us great scenes such as the doughnutdunking lesson Walls Of Jericho and the nowclassic hitchhiking scene The humour is still fresh and fastpaced over  years later Oops I almost forgot the classic no undershirt scene where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses to reveal shock horror! no undershirt but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of mens undershirts which dropped dramatically after the films release One of the first examples of product placement in film Great supporting characters particularly the scenestealing Oscar Shapeley Roscoe Karns Of course it has its faults all early talkies do But any faults are outweighed by the great story Technically it was wellmade for its timeIHON won  Oscars Best Picture Best Director Frank Capra Best Actress and Best Actor for Colbert and Gable and Best Adaptation It deserved all of them Funnily enough both Colbert and Gable didn&amp;#;t want any part in the film at first I bet they changed their viewpoint after the surprise success and the prestigious Academy Awards they gained for it Its been said that a number of Disney characters like Bugs Bunny Yosemite Sam and Pepe LePew were inspired by characters in this film A classic a mustsee a great movie,10
849,tt0025316,This is a pleasant funny classic that shows it age only slightly and that has a lot of scenes you can look forward to each time that you see it Gable and Colbert each get roles that are nicely suited to them and are wellremembered for their performances  The supporting cast also rounds out the picture with some good character actingThe crosscountry trip on the bus and via other assorted methods is fun to watch with several nice vignettes that complement the main story line The atmosphere on the long bus trip is done especially well  The plot is of course not meant to be taken too seriously in itself but it comes in very handy for setting up good characters and comedyIt all comes across as effortlessly entertaining romantic comedy with some classic scenes and characters you learn to care for in spite of their mistakes,0
850,tt0025316,This sweet comedy never loses its appeal  Claudette Colbert is a spoiled young girl who meets a wordly attractive newspaper reporter Clark Gable In the beginning she treats him like a servant but he never knuckles under to this behavior  The interaction between these two is very romantic and humorous  It is the classic portrayal of what may be called sexual tension  He takes care of her  does not take advantage of her  but makes her realize that her wealthy background cannot carry her through as a human being she has to earn his respect by treating him with respect  There is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike and their breakfast is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find  As Gable stands at the edge of the road and Colbert is perched atop a wooden fence his wisecracking posture is said to be the inspiration for the beloved cartoon character Bugs Bunny  This is a mustsee for every one who loves old movies and entertaining for all,10
851,tt0025316,It Happened One Night is one of those films that is so classic and on so many `mustsee lists that I actually assumed that I had seen it at one time or another  It wasnt until I actually looked into the film when I in fact realized I hadntThe first film to sweep the major categories in an Oscar ceremony It Happened One Night spins the story of a young spoiled heiress Colbert who marries a shallow yet dashing aviator  She is then swept off by her father who takes her on a cruise; convinced that time away from each other will cure her infatuation  Instead she escapes by jumping out of the boat and swimming to shore where she begins her journey from Miami to New York where her husband awaits  The film quickly turns into an `on the road flick at this point when she meets up with Clark Gable a down on his luck reporter who offers to help her for the exclusive rights to her story  Mayhem inevitably ensues as one thing after another goes wrong during their adventureIm a little hesitant to completely agree with the general assessment that It Happened One Night is a screwball comedy  Of course there were certain moments that were hilarious and overdone the scene when Gable and Colbert pose as husband and wife to share a cabin for the night is absolutely rich but the majority of the remaining film is clever romantic comedy with fairly even performances by the principles  Perhaps there is a sliding scale for screwball comedies with It Happened One Night being a two and a film that I feel personifies the genre Bringing up Baby as a five,8
852,tt0025316,Consider this It Happened One Night was made in  which gives it the distinction + years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences And most of the runnerups for oldest film are s screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the  Academy Awards The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant The main reason It Happened One Night worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capras direction Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut Cohn told Capra That French broad likes money and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $ double her usual price and a guarantee that production would only last  days Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this filmThe film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra a great script that would play well with small town America and a good ensemble of supporting talent The story concerns a spoiled young heiress Colbert trying to escape the control of her father nicely played by Walter Connelly Dodging her fathers private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter Gable who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other brainless brat and obnoxious bully as an undisclosed affection develops On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each otherWhile the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film As another reviewer has written Far from loveydovey the dialogue is witty sharp and occasionally heartless We may know the outcome but the road to get there is paved with arguments anger and misunderstandings Its also clever funny and a bit risqué for   During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult motivated by a desire to improve her companions opinion of her Gable shows real star presence playing a confident charming and resourceful gentleman By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partnerAfter the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director OscarThen again what do I know? Im only a child,9
853,tt0025316,I have seen this movie a few times over the year and have just recently  viewed it again twice on the DVD version This is a highly recommended  movie on several levels First it has to be seen because it won  multiple academy awards during  It has won at least best actor best actress and best director  So it should be seen just for its historical significance if you are  into movies as an art form However if you are just looking for  entertainment then it is simply a great classic romantic comedy The  set up is that Ellie Claudette Colbert is a rich spoiled  independent woman who is running away from her father in Florida to  join her husband not quite a complete marriage in New York City She  meets Peter Clark Gable on the bus who is a down &amp; out reporter  looking for a big story They join forces in that he will help her to  get to New York for an exclusive on her story In essence it is the  bratty socialite vs the hard nosed know it all reporter  Can they  achieve true love? Just watch the movie and figure it out for  yourself There is the classical scene regarding the battle of the  sexes which involves hitchhiking There is some dated material because  the movie was made in the s about the s This may be both good  and bad as a viewing experience Gable is a bit too shallow as a  desirable character He lacks the sensitivity of a guy that would be in  a modern romantic comedy However his portrayal of Peter is likely  typical for the ideal man of the era in that he attempted to be  competent and in charge at all times the know it all guy The  character comes across as too simplistic by todays standards However  when he gets the feedback on his rough edges from Ellie he shows his  nice guy side Claudette Colbert is great in this movie she had  opportunities to display her acting craft as she responded to different  situations The scene in which she and Gable pretended to be basically  white trash was very funny Her getting the best actress award is  very evident even without having to see the performances of her  rivalries for the Oscar in  Overall this movie is rated a  and  is highly recommended A viewer may avoid older movies because they  lack dept; however hang in for this one Once the screen chemistry  starts between Colbert and Gable their first scene together the rest  of the picture is just a joyride of entertainment in watching these two  work their magic for the camera Enjoy this movie it should be an  awesome experience,0
854,tt0025316,In my college film class we had begun watching It happened one night I was laughing my head off But of course my professor stops the movie right when it was getting good After that I wanted to see this movie so badly My father lucky enough had the movie I watched it and it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen Clark Gable is histerical He really does a great job in the film I always did prefer the old comedies to today Do you blame me? If you watch the flick you will enjoy it This is one of the first romantic comedies Itll send all the others to the back of the bus I would higly recommend this movie Its a classic/,10
855,tt0025316,Released in  Frank Capras It Happened One Night ushered in a new era of Hollywood filmmaking  the screwball comedy  and made Academy Award history in the process It became the first film to be awarded the top five awards on the night Best Picture Director Actor Actress and Screenplay a feat that remained unequaled until One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  and The Silence of the Lambs  As I watch more of his films Frank Capra is fast becoming one of my most respected directors with such classics as Mr Smith Goes to Washington and Its a Wonderful Life ranking among my favourites of all time This screwball comedy however posed a certain problem since Ive never been a huge fan of the subgenre Whilst I had enjoyed such films as My Man Godfrey and His Girl Friday they hadnt really offered anything other than comedy This means that they did a good job of making us laugh but never really inspired any other emotions  which isnt necessarily a handicap but doesnt appeal to my tastesHappily Im able to announce that It Happened One Night did surpass my expectations and I found it to be a wonderfullyenjoyable very touching romantic comedy The first half had left me feeling a bit uncertain since it reminded me of just about every other s comedy Id seen but then Frank Capra did what Frank Capra does best he put a lot of heart into the film After building towards a perfect fairytale ending Capra suddenly snatches it away slowly but surely stacking the odds against our hero However the director has never been one to leave us with a downbeat ending and when love finally prevails it feels twice as triumphant Of course crucial to the films success are the two lead performers Claudette Colbert and Clarke Gable playing characters of completely polar characters As story runs its course we slowly watch their relationship transform from completely dislike to acceptance to romance and it never feels forced or artificial despite a reportedly tense atmosphere onsetThe plot of the film was based on the story The Night Bus by Samuel Hopkins Adams Ellie Andrews Colbert is the arrogant spoilt heiress of a wealthy father Walter Connolly After she marries the rich but unprincipled King Westley Jameson Thomas against her fathers will Ellie strikes off to New York to be with the man she loves and her desperate father launches a statewide attempt to retrieve her It is on a night bus that Ellie strikes up a frictional relationship with fired journalist Peter Warne Gable whose only initial interest in the stranded girl is a good newspaper story Probably one of the best road movies ever made It Happened One Night also has a few twists in the usual formula which have guaranteed its enduring stature For example Ellies father is revealed not to be an evil overbearing demon but is in fact shown to be a very kind reasonable and loving man who is only trying to guarantee the best for his daughter by ensuring that she marries somebody with principles King Westley later gives up the girl without a fuss compensated by a tidy sum of moneyMuch to my surprise Id never seen a film starring Clarke Gable before but he really was a revelation Never taking any situation too seriously and delivering every line with confidence and a hint of amusement Gable is the laidback everyman that the audience can relate to a stark contrast to Colberts conceited and ungrateful upperclass rich girl My favourite scene took place after the night bus accidentally ran off the road with the shifty passenger Oscar Shapeley Roscoe Karns threatening to reveal Ellies true identity Fearing that his exclusive story could leak into other hands Peter Warne declares himself to be the gangster who kidnapped Ellie threatens to harm Shapeleys family and then chases him into the night Interestingly I followed up my viewing of this film with a  Lux Radio Theater broadcast of the story introduced by Cecille B DeMille and once again starring Gable and Colbert This recording can be found if youre lucky as a special feature on the It Happened One Night DVD and its well worth a listen,8
856,tt0025316,I was inspired to think of other films with completely mystifying titles `The Phantom Menace obviously  Also `The Shop Around the Corner around the corner from WHERE? `The Empire Strikes Back it doesnt `The Living Daylights `True Lies `Batman Forever `Species `The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp  if anyone has any more suggestions please send them to meIn this case it happens over several nights and Im not sure which particular night is being referred to  Probably one of the candidate nights is less unobvious than the rest; so I guess the title isnt COMPLETELY mystifying  But actually Capra gives us the feeling that everything is up in the air  Everyone knows that the hero and heroine of romantic comedies are bound to get hitched in the end  in most cases its simply a question of staying awake  But Capra makes us feel the contingency of it all  I for one was convinced that right up until the final moment it could have gone either way  How did Capra manage this?  Was it because he was a complete innocent; or was it because he was remarkably sophisticated?  I dont suppose it matters its results that countIm glad to see very little mention among the comments about the sexism of it all  The characters have life; their words have life; and if such art as this could only be produced by a sexist society its almost worth creating a sexist society and then dismantling it in order to get the art  In modern romances I get the feeling that the writers are wearily writing `feisty lines for the heroine in an attempt to fool feminists who by and large arent so easily fooled  Claudette Colbert isnt feisty  When she DOES assert her independence she means itAnd of course when Clark Gable asserts his dominance HE means it  You dont get sincerity like this these daysAnyway the ideology of a film if there is one is always beside the point except inasmuch as the ideology is AESTHETICALLY attractive or unattractive This is an attractive film  Two real individuals a real story some misunderstanding but no tiresome or pointless misunderstanding constant wit  and as I expressed amazement at earlier constant suspense  And if THAT isnt enough to get you to watch it note that it was released in   The Hayes code didnt come into effect until   Not a moment too late,10

858,tt0025316,Capras It Happened One Night is a fascinatingly shot romantic comedy It has the s feel but at the same time I am surprised that such skill was used in the making of this movie during the s The camerawork is brilliant as it brings out both the spatial feel and the crowdiness the long shots are effective and I liked how the scenes change in a sideways flip mode Theres always something about the driving scenes of old classics that amuse me Clearly the background was shot separately and then projected on to a screen during the shooting of the film while in the foreground the actors are just seated in a car pretending to drive While the background scene changes the viewer keeps tuned to the wonderful dialogue between the actors Needless to add the films got fantastic dialogueCapra also brilliantly gives us a glimpse of the s American society especially focusing on gender and class status The difference between the upper class rich people and the common ordinary man is shown by their use of language and their nonverbal behaviour Yet in a way the film is also ahead of its time Ellie isnt just some clichéd damsel of the s She is strongminded stubborn and smart albeit slightly naive She is one who fights for what she wants rather than giving in easily Perhaps this is also one quality of hers that attracts Peter but at the same time their funny quarrels also indicate that there is a an equality in gender status which was something women were struggling with in those daysThe characters are very well etched Peter and Ellie were a lot of fun but I also liked how Alexander Andrews played excellently by Walter Connolly was written as the rich father whos got all the money but all he wants for his daughter is her happiness Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are great together as they match wits and display warm chemistryIt Happened One Night has become an instant favourite one that I definitely plan to revisit,0

And Ellen not knowing whats going on replies I dont know what you are talking about! Thats a perfect example how someone is trying to be a gentleman and ends up as a fool But this is actually a film more touching than funny After a while the spoiled Ellen shows her gentle side and realizes that she loves Peter She says this to her father in tears because she thinks that Peter doesnt love her So incredibly magical and yet so simple Its incredibly high grade of / on the site rottentomatoescom is justified Too bad almost all TV stations are keeping this jewel of air for decades! No wonder my generation is trapped in a vicious circle of violence drugs and alcohol They never got a glimpse of such previous generations with a soul and such raw honest and touching beauty like It happened one night which exceeds the human mindGrade /,10
863,tt0025316,Its a true call that they dont make the movies as they used to There are very less movies coming near to the brilliance of It Happened One Night This movie is about a rich brat running from her home to get married with her lover accompanied with struggling free lancer reporter in her journey And in the journey they fall for each other The romance building between two of them is nicely depicted and the blend of Peter Warne Gables arrogant personality gives it a nice stir The story of the movie is very interesting and the comic attribute added by both Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is sufficed to make anyone laugh The perfect direction from the master of his domain Frank Capra takes the movie on highest level; because of this its the first movie to be honored with all major five Oscars Best Actor Best Actress Best Movie Best Director and Best Screenplay,10
864,tt0025316,It Happened One Night happens to be my personal most favorite film ever It was an adapted screenplay by Robert Riskin from the short story Night Bus and was directed by Frank Capra With a simple story plot modest budget and a very short four week production schedule this film goes a long way Director Frank Capra obviously knew the story to tell and how to tell it Some of the best films are made in a surprisingly short amount of time and on a modest budget This film followed what Capra hoped would be a critical and box office success The hopes were low for this film even after securing stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert for the lead roles Columbia Studios was not well respected at the time in HollywoodIt Happened One Night  had a relatively small budget for its time $ of which Claudette Colbert asked for and received $ for her role A star receiving this much of the total film budget was unheard of during the s Released during Americas Great Economic Depression the film had excellent timing and proved to be a big critical and audience hit All the right elements came together It had a high quality comedic screenplay with believable characters in believable situations A film where luck and chemistry came together producing a film that exceeded the expectations of everyone involved including its director Frank CapraThe film comes across as light hearted and natural and with excellent timing and pacing For its time this style of film was new It would be one of the first of a new genre screwball romantic comedy Winner of five Academy Awards in all the major categories Best Picture Director Adapted Screenplay Actor in a Leading Role and Actress in a Leading Role was a first in Hollywood history Only two other films have swept the five top Academy Awards One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest  and The Silence of the Lambs Claudette Colbert was quoted as saying I just finished the worst film ever on It Happened One Night She had no idea how well the film would be edited The film editing here is subtle and sublime Colbert and Gable achieved that rare and special screen chemistry in the film Colberts demand that the film needed to be produced in four weeks because of her vacation schedule actually created the lively pace of the film working in its favor It Happened One Night is a fine example of a quality screenplay some good luck and a lot of chemistry all coming together producing an enduring and enjoyable comedy classicClark Gable comes across as completely natural and very entertaining The fun had while making this film shows partly in Gables performance Unfortunately he would not be cast in a comedic role again even after the big success of this film The studio system of the time demanded stars remain typecasted For Gable that meant macho romantic leading action manTo me It Happened One Night is the best ever romantic comedy film a gold standard for its genre Its lost none of its charm and naturalness since its release in  The look of the film dates it but it still delivers its original naturalness charm wittiness timing pacing and entertainment value Just about a perfectly made film,10
865,tt0025316,It Happened One Night must have put on a smile on Depressionweary audiences way back in  Over  years later the magic still works due to the terrific combination of Gable Colbert and director CapraBut it almost didnt happen at allBoth Gable and Colbert tried desperately to get out of doing IHON In fact it appeared noone in Hollywood wanted the parts of Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews The tiny cashstrapped Columbia Studios was making this film with an untried comedy formula it looked a certain flop Pfft How wrong everyone was IHON swept the Academy Awards taking home all of the Major Awards including Best Actor and Actress Awards for Gable and Colbert It established the screwball comedy genre and the careers of its two stars and director CapraWhy is it so good? Well it has remained so fresh over the years that the laughs beat out almost every modern romantic comedy It doesnt have to rely on smut or toilet humour to satisfy the audience just a classic battle of the sexes we can all relate to Its witty the dialogue is snappy and fastpaced and the acting is near perfect So lets have a closer look at the plot of this gem Spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Colbert has just defied her father by marrying society aviator King Westley Her angry father wishes to keep Ellie away from her unsuitable husband and whisks her away on his private yacht Daddy hasnt counted on Ellies tenacity and will fed up with the fact her childish hungerstrike is going nowhere she literally jumps overboard When back on dry land she tries to make her way back to her husband by bus trip A series of unfortunate events bring out of work newspaper reporter Peter Warne into her life Cue the battle of the sexes! She has no money so she must accept his help; he knows who she is and to land the biggest scoop of his career he must deceive her whilst also helping her get back to Westley But problems arise when the pair inevitably start to fall in loveThis film is just the tonic that Depression audiences would have soaked up The parodying of the rich is sublime you cant help rooting for Gable who is a fine representative of the underdog It also has its risqué elements that Im surprised got past the Hayes Code that had just been enforced In particular Gables sexy lesson to a shocked yet interested Colbert on how a man undresses and the final breaking down the walls of Jericho scene When Gable undressed to reveal a bare chest with NO undershirt sales dropped off dramatically This would be one of the earliest examples of product placement in filmSome of my favourite scenes the donutdunking lesson the piggyback ride Gable and Colberts mock fight and the justifiably classic Hitchhiking scene Colbert beats the cocky Gable at his own game by proving that SHE doesnt have to use her thumb to pull a ride Instead she shows a bit of leg and stops a vehicle much to the horror of Gable Great stuff!This film almost singlehandedly established the great screwball comedy Colberts Ellie is the ultimate screwy damepaving the way for Lombard and Hepburn in the genre with Gables Peter a direct forerunner to the Fredrich March character in the screwball classic Nothing Sacred  This films holds a very important place in motion picture historyBest of all its so enjoyable/,10
866,tt0025316,The first movie to sweep all the major Academy Awards this film is still popular today Thats probably so because the dialog between the two stars of the picture  Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert  is just great Those two make this fun to watch I enjoyed it however much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect The ending too was very weak Over the last  minutes the two stars go their separate ways until the very end and the story gets very stupidThe nice romance that had developed between the two seemed to have disintegrated when Gable left one early morning for good intentions but didnt tell Colbert The latter thought Gable ran out on her Hollywood in films of the s and s loved to have romances in which confusion abounded and everything was misinterpreted for the worstuntil the happy ending when the truth somehow would surface That same theme was in here along with yet another trivialization of marriage another common theme during the classic era Colbert says it herself in one line mentioning she doesnt care for this other guy but what the heck might as well get married whats the difference? Huh?If the scriptwriters here would have just kept the road part of this film going longer  with Gable and Colbert trading barbs  it would have been super Gable has the best lines an is the most fun to watch but Colbert can hold her own She looks really pixieish and cute although most of her closeups are done with a fuzzy lens another habit of filmmakers of that era had with female stars One of the film worlds most famous scenes is in this movie the hitchhiking scene in which the cocky Cable explains the different ways of successful thumbing in order to get a rideand gets nowhere while Colbert on her first try gets a car to stop immediately after she lifts up her skirt! That is still one of the great comedic scenes in movie historyOverall this is still one of the best comedies of The Golden Age even with its faults,8
867,tt0025316,A cute love story that rivals any of the cookiecutter romantic comedies of today Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert play very well off of each other Sure its cheesy in parts but thats what makes these older movies so much fun,8
868,tt0025316,Its been over eighty years since It Happened One Night debuted on screens and still it remains the quintessential romantic comedy to watch While being the influence of countless films since It Happened One Night is triumphant and timeless because of its great cast director and script At the start of the film we see the beautiful Ellen Andrews Claudette Colbert in Florida aboard her wealthy fathers luxury boat Ellen is planning to marry King Westley but her father disapproves of him and forces her to stay on the boat until he can find someone more suitable to his liking This leads her to run away and seek out Westly herself while her father puts out a highly publicized bounty for her return She boards a bus to New York and crosses paths with the charismatic Peter Warne Clark Gable Hes a gifted newspaper reporter who also has a drinking problem that constantly gets him in trouble Once Warne figures out who Ellen really is he proposes a plan to her He will escort her to New York for the rights to her story which has become a national headline While the seemingly mismatched pair goes on an adventure they eventually warm up and become close The plot flies at a freeflowing pace that allows for wickedly good oneliners The script is fantastic and allows for great comedic timing and also a sense of drama There is a bit of suspense as the willthey wontthey couple explore their feelings for each other While watching the film you get the sense that they will end up together but its never fully guaranteed and leaves room for you to doubt We meet several supporting characters that mostly never overstay their welcomes such as the bumbling Shapeley and boisterous Zeke They are great in the small amount of time they get and dont distract from the main narrative One minor problem with the story is that the geography is very confusing The audience is left out of the loop when it comes to knowing where exactly the leads are This makes it hard to track the importance of each settingThis is the prime example and maybe founding of the screwball comedy Screwball comedies tell the story of two leads often an unmarried man and woman that come from different social classes and how they interact with each other based on their previous lifestyles If you like films such as Heaven Can Wait and Raising Arizona you should thank this film for popularizing the genre Frank Capra won the academy award for Best Director for this film and he totally deserved it He balances his cast well and allows them to have total freedom within the cramped space of the frame He pushes the camera for claustrophobic scenes that force the actors to work together to make the physical comedy work The acting is the definite draw and best part of the film Both Gable and Colbert took home academy awards for their performances Gable will go down as one of the best romantic leads ever Hes handsome quick on his feet and witty He also delivers the perfect oneliners with confidence and swagger to make women want him and men to want to be him Colbert does an excellent job as the uptight and bratty female that so many leading ladies are still trying to replicate almost eighty years later She perfectly embodies a rich girl that is out of her element while in the real world She bounces off Gables laid back working man character with ease and her oneliners are just as good or even better than his Walter Connolly also does a good job as Ellies wealthy father Alexander Andrews He plays the overprotective but also understanding father At first he wants Ellen to marry someone rich and famous in order to boost his social status but after seeing her unhappiness he changes and sees the errors of his ways Hes one of those fathers that every girl wants and every man should strive to be It Happened One Night is the biggest influence on the romantic comedy genre Having the great pair of Gable and Colbert and Capra as the director lifts this film to the heavens of classic cinema Even in  the film is still fun and can be used to teach writers how to create good comedy,7
869,tt0025316,OMG this film so hilarious clever and sweet It has original story and fresh idea about romantic comedy Clark Gable really did excellent job to bring this film more live He is so funny clever and comical Everything that he is doing in this film look so natural and funny Definitely one of Clarks best performance He really deserve an Oscar for his performance Chemistry between he and Claudette Colbert very delightful and cute Just simply romantic Bravo!!!,10
870,tt0027977,Part satire part slapstick comedy part melodrama; the great pioneer of film Charles Chaplin has created his own monument with this film At the same time Modern Times was Chaplins last goodbye to the era of silent film  which remarkably had already ended almost a decade earlierAfter nearly  years this screen marvel still makes me laugh cry  and think about the ongoing automatization of practically every trivial little thing in our lives Modern times indeed To me this film is as entertaining and funny today as I imagine it was then and its certainly as relevant as it was then The tramp still rules My vote  out of Favorite films http//wwwIMDbcom/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesserknown Masterpieces http//wwwimdbcom/list/ls/Favorite LowBudget and BMovies http//wwwimdbcom/list/ls/Favorite TVShows reviewed http//wwwimdbcom/list/ls/,9
871,tt0027977,Charlie Chaplins Modern Times  is the final film to feature the great actor/director/writers most easily recognizable incarnation The Tramp Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film Indeed several iconographic studies have labeled The Tramp with his worn hat distinctive mustache dusty suit cane and trademark waddle as the single most identifiable fictional image in historyStill the film that perhaps most influenced the creation and thematic realization of Modern Times was not even a silent one The Jazz Singer which debuted in  five years before Modern Times began production is perhaps the most important watershed film in the industrys centuryold history In the film comic great Al Jolson stands up in front of the audience andsings And as Millard Mitchell said in Singin in the Rain the public was suddenly in a frenzy for Talking pictures! Talking pictures! Sadly with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue the world of silent filmmaking began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable Nevertheless Chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating City Lights  which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made but by the time Modern Times was released Chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying artModern Times is not an entirely silent film there are dialogue snippets and sound effects but if you look closely every character with dialogue excluding Chaplin himself is being mocked Even when The Tramp opens his mouth the only time he ever did so in a film the words are nonsensical defying the burgeoning convention that dialogue is mandatory for substance entertainment and qualityDespite the films status as one of the greatest comedies of alltime it is hard to ignore the political component In his movies Chaplin often exhibited a great mistrust for authority and progress as often embodied through the social elite the police and wealthy entrepreneurs The irony of the films title then is twofold It connects with Chaplins own bitter feelings regarding his moribund art form but also refers to the plight of the working classes during the Great Depression long working hours with little job security and meager salary while the upper classes remain wealthy and bide their idle time The world was changing fast and Chaplin foresaw that many of these changes were far from beneficialAs we watch The Tramp struggle through the modern mechanized world we laugh at his antics and the absurdity of their results but we can also feel pain and pity He is clearly a man who does not belong Indeed The Tramp can almost be thought of as a misfit who has passed through a membrane from some alternate reality and unwittingly fallen into our familiar world notice that he does not have a name or identification of any kind and as far as we know he has no friends family funds or historyHe takes on assembly lines feeding machines department stores policemen and various other massoriented aspects of the industrialized world all which demand and exhibit sameness and conformity but The Tramp and his symbolic extension the individual never seem to fitThis is consequently why Modern Times is also one of the most poignant love stories ever put on film The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young homeless woman who is referred to as The Gamin and is played by Chaplins thenwife Paulette Goddard These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward despite adversity Both are nameless neither has a home and they each have no money or material possessionsIt is here that Chaplin makes his most poignant and saddening statement about modern living The Tramp and The Gamin are the only characters who exhibit individuality and idealism yet they are also the ones lowest on the social and economic food chain The conclusion of the film which most likely reflects upon Chaplins own emotions is tinged with sadness but also a lingering hopefulness that resonates as loudly and clearly today as it did more than sixty years agoThen there is of course the comedy which is the stuff of legendary status Some of the most memorable comic images in film history are found in Modern Times These include The Tramps bout with an assembly line and his resulting twitches his unfortunate encounter with nosepowder the moment when he quite literally becomes a cog in the wheels of industry and his epic struggle to bring roast duck to an angry customerIn my opinion however the two standout moments are the scene in a department store involving a blindfold and some rollerskates the most exquisite moment of comedy in the film and the sequence where The Tramp is submitted to the mad whim of an outofcontrol feeding machine the most uproarious moment in the filmThese are just a handful of moments that make Modern Times the enduring masterpiece that it is On a personal level the aspect of the film that resonates strongest with me is its appeal to the idealistic misfit in all of us In our hearts many of us long for the simplicity and exuberance with which The Tramp and The Gamin live life with attention to the bare essentials and an absence of need for materialism and modern trappingsAs Chaplin so skillfully shows however our modern times make this lifestyle a faded dream lost among the sheeplike herds of men and women scurrying through a modern metropolis that only Fritz Lang could make seem darker and more devoid of true humanity Still the final image of Modern Times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an everchanging world,10
872,tt0027977,It is difficult to review Chaplins movies objectively because many of us have seen them or at least have heard about them since we were young They have become part of our emotional and/or cultural backgroundChaplin is arguably the only complete director in most of his pictures he also produces acts writes the script composes the music does his own stunts and edits His talent and reputation generated numerous commercial successes even when he continued directing silent movies after their time Talkies were the only films produced after  the few silent attempts afterwards were failures; yet Chaplin was an exception City Lights in  and Modern Times in  were sensations worldwide the latter includes a few sounds but they are marginal This is remarkable since nine years is an eternity in cinema timeframe Only in  did Chaplin direct a talkie*** WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS ***Is the movie a comedy? Partly tragicomedy is Chaplins trademark In my opinion there are three levels of humour Pure amusement sometimes as in slapstick the tramp eats all he can to be sent to jail and even buys more when he is with the policeman; he is drugged in jail; the tramp and the gamin imagine their life in an idyllic house; the tramp rollerskates close to an edge in the department store fabulous stunt; he makes a lousy waiter but a great actor at the end Again I am not certain how much of the fun is derived from childhood memories and/or the fact we feel younger as we watch the film To enjoy it fully we must lay aside some of our adult critical sense notably towards oldfashioned cinema No humour just drama the gamins father dies; her sisters are taken away; the tramp crashes his way through the crowd to get a job an efficient illustration of ruthless competition  Amusement with a dramatic twist these are the most frequent scenes and probably the best We grin even as we laugh The movie opens on sheep moving grouped of which a black one an allusion to the tramp? that fade out to workers coming out of the subway This must have been a shock for the audience during the Great Depression Another example is one of Chaplins most famous scenes ever the tramp tries the eating machine It is at the same time hilarious Chaplin really gives all of himself here and pathetic a metaphor on illconceived progress oppression of man by machine and conditions of workers obliged to comply with strange requestsOther scenes include the entire first part in the factory including when the tramp is stuck in the machine inside shot that became iconic which also happens to a colleague later on outside shot; the tramp launches by mistake an unfinished ship into the sea with footage of an actual ship that was probably sunk because of the Depression; the tramp and the gamin make most of their shabby hutThe movie efficiently alternates these three levels of humour as well as its rhythm It famously starts as a whirlwind with dynamic tempo and music And it ends like a rollercoaster funny musical the tramp sings emotional he is hired dramatic the police arrest the gamin thriller they run away as climatic music plays melancholic they are on the road free but uncertain The last image is rightfully doubleedged the tramp and the gamin walk away but mountains ahead block their road She looks like an elegant lady he looks a bit like a clown with his funny walk and big shoes We dont know where they are going nor do theyHence Chaplins ambition was far more than to just divert Themes depicted eighty years ago are still modern<ul><li>Crisis redundancies strikes inequalities social unrest</li></ul><ul><li>Working conditions in factories even though exaggerated by humour and symbols productivity control burnout</li></ul><ul><li>Technology that dehumanises chainworking the eating machine video surveillance a sciencefiction element at the time Remarkably the only sounds of the film are coming from devices not humans screen phonograph radio</li></ul><ul><li>Success with talent work and some luck</li></ul><ul><li>The law The topic is prominent the police are omnipresent and ambiguous Can one steal food to survive?

873,tt0027977,Modern Times is in my top  films and # in my list of favorite comedies Charles Chaplin is arguably the most talented human being nevermind film maker that ever lived I first saw this treasure about  years ago and I watched it again recently to make sure that it really WAS funny and that I had not given it too much praise because it was simply a Chaplin film Modern Times passed my test with flying colors I laughed hysterically from start to finish Each and every scene is innovative well thought out and executed with the genius that only Chaplin possessed Among my favorite scenes are the automatic workerfeeding machine; the jail scene in the cafeteria when The Tramp accidentally sprinkles cocaine on his food thinking it is salt; and the roller skating scene in the department store No special effects or computer animation just pure simple geniusThe storyline in Modern Times is purposefully naive a trick Chaplin used time and again to bring a profound humanitarian quality to his films Watching this film is comparable to watching a Warner Bros cartoon which coming from me is a sincere compliment The level of physical comedy in Modern Times is on par with the masterful short films of Chuck Jones Friz Freleng and othersFinally as was the case with most of his later films Modern Times is a serious social commentary Its message is as relevant today as it was more than sixty years ago when it was released In fact it is arguably even more relevant today and unless the world changes drastically in the future it will continue to be Modern Times is essentially the story of a simple but extremely kind man caught in the traps of industrialized society The opening scene which compares a crowd of workers boarding the subway to a flock of sheep is Chaplins warning against standardization mechanization and other facets of life which rob men and women of their individuality Chaplin always tried to speak for the downtrodden because despite his enormous success and wealth he never forgot where he came from In the end Modern Times is a reminder that no matter how bad things are you can still smile Charles Chaplin has made more people smile than almost any other and his legacy of love and laughter lives on in his films Its up to us to keep his legacy alive,10
874,tt0027977,Favorite Chaplin film Packed with social commentary that is still relevant today Chaplin does a superb job of representing the average worker of the time and the mental impact that the daily motions of what we consider normal in society Such as the opening of the movie in which a scene of a morning rush of people going to work fades into a herd of sheep Chaplin hilarious slapstick comedy is also present in this film while still keeping serious undertones The best example of this is the eating machine This particular scene was a perfect representation of the problems in our society a machine meant to further regiment the day of a worker only to break in the process while also causing a laugh out loud reaction My favorite part of this film is definitely the ending in which Chaplin sings a song and dances What makes this scene so great is not only the fact that it was the first time Chaplin/The Tramp ever spoke but that it was also a stance against talkies Although Chaplin sings the lyrics are complete gibberish but the audience understands regardless All in all I believe Modern Times is Chaplins greatest film this was the first Chaplin film I had ever seen and since then have watched all of them and found a great respect for Chaplin and silent movies overall,10
875,tt0027977,It is a testament to Chaplins filmmaking skills that he is able to impose such significant meaning on what really boils down to little more than a series of comedy skits strung together on an apparently flimsy clothesline of a plot Indeed the cinematic value of Modern Times is unquestionable but it is ironically noteworthy that such a simple and even blocky plot is made into such a memorable film experience and delivers such a strong timetranscending message about poverty stricken populations,10
876,tt0027977,Hilarious touching anarchic revolutionary realist surreal of its time timeless  Modern Times is a multifaceted work of genius When its over and you recall the number of sight gags and magic sequences Chaplin has packed into  minutes it is incredible  the conveyer belt and nut turning; Chaplin caught in the cogwheels; the feeding machine; the Red Flag march; the nose powder; the roller skating ballet; the waiter with tray caught up in the dance my favourite; the gibberish song  and many more Then there is his mixing of silent and sound techniques making the best of both worlds not falling between stools as some directors might have doneOf course there is also a political and social dimension; many of the scenes refer to the impact of technical advances of bureaucracy and of the then current depression on the ordinary little man And it is the little man the individual caught up in societys complex machinery whom Chaplin championed He may have sympathised with leftwing political parties and unions in so far as they supported ordinary working people but Chaplins essential beliefs are enshrined in the final words and shot with him telling Paulette Godard that she should keep smiling they will get along as they walk a couple of individuals into an uncertain future Beyond politics the individual has to rely on his or her own resources and spirit to survive,0
877,tt0027977,This movie is a must see for anyone who loves comedies  Charlie Chaplin is at his alltime best as the Tramp and he has wonderful chemistry with Paulette Goddards Gamin  Together they provide an hour and a half of nonstop laughs  My favorite parts are when he is fed by a modern machine that goes awry and then when Charlie goes crazy in the factory  The situations and expressions are hilarious!  Please see this movie soonyou definitely will not regret it,10
878,tt0027977,Greetings from LithuaniaModern Times  is my first movie which i saw that features Charles Chaplin Saw it first time in  but nevertheless its a great movie Comedy here is truly funny and its not just a comedy It tells a story with some underlying themes that are still kinda topical till this day – technology is changing evolving and if you are not keeping pace with it you will have some hard times like our hero of this movieActing here is very solid actually i was surprised of how well acted this movie was – no one overreacted Story itself is interesting and movie is very well paced – at running time  h  min it almost never drags and is entertaining from start till finishOverall Modern Times is a black and white silent movie there are some sounds actually which safely can be viewed for the first time even in  –  years after its original release It has some truly genuine comedic situations it tells good story and pacing of picture is very solid Maybe it is not possible to review this movie correctly now because its very old but great movies are great movies – they can be viewed no matter what,9
879,tt0027977,Chaplins Modern Times has influenced the th century as much as any other film could have His portrayal of man vs machine individual vs group love vs industryis the framework of classic modern American antiprogressive thinking Gilliams Brazil is the late century equivalent But Chaplin hit it right first insuring generations would have the chance to relate to the challenges of their own modern times,10
880,tt0027977,Long after most people thought the silent movie had been buried forever Chaplin brought his Little Fellow out of mothballs for one more magnificent motion picture The Tramp is trapped in a factory performing mindnumbing repetitive tasks and finally he goes hilariously berserk I started laughing the instant I saw the lady in the dress with the buttons Like City Lights this film is a collection of charming vignettes this time revolving around The Tramps desire to settle down with gamin Paulette Goddard From the Tramps encounter with an assemblyline feeding machine to his unsuccessful stints as night watchman and waiter this movie is packed full of delights Chaplin never speaks but he does sing a little This work of genius can make you smile though your heart is breaking,0
881,tt0027977,Charles Chaplin seemingly had been pushed out of the movie business by the earlys due to the advent of sound a medium that just never seemed right with him Chaplin probably the best filmmaker/performer of the th Century did not despair though He fought back with heart and emotion and by  Modern Times was a major box office and critical success It is a movie that quietly showed a man suffering through a world of change As a factory worker in the film Chaplin tries to cope with the industrial revolution and tries to make it through a quickly changing US economy He finds love with vagrant Paulette Goddard who ended up marrying Chaplin in real life and the two come together and lean on one another in a world of uncertainty and change Modern Times is one of those films that will put a smile on your face but it could make you weep just as easily Chaplins world was changing and not necessarily for the better from his point of view and he wanted to express the variations in his old way of doing things and the new way everyone else had accepted Goddard is also probably the best actress to match Chaplins charm in one of his pictures Their love for one another even though the marriage lasted a relatively short amount of time in real life just seems to shine on the silver screen and they have a chemistry that is sweet and heartwarming Beautifully made wonderfully written perfectly performed smart insightful and always brilliant Modern Times is another film from Chaplin that will brand itself on the souls of all true lovers of the cinema  stars out of ,0
882,tt0027977,This is absolutely the finest film Charlie Chaplin ever madewhich considering the overall quality of his work says a great deal for the quality of the film  Genius is a much overused word but in Chaplins case its use is apt  This is one of the classics of cinema and one of the greatest films ever made!  The scenes in the factory are hilarious You have got to see this film!  Most joyously totally and highly RECOMMENDED!!!!!,10
883,tt0027977,Somehow this very old film is particularly modern today and the exaggerations are not really sooo extreme compared with the real world The humans enslaved by the machines and by those who control them become more and more small and insignificant like the hero of this very funny comedy one of the best in the history that speaks about very ugly things in a very amusing way The Tramp is not a tramp in the beginning He has a real job in a modern factory that almost kills him as the factory becomes more and more modern He becomes a tramp when he stays without a job Picking up red flags in the street can get you in a big problem with the police who are there to serve and protect the rich An honest man can stay honest even in prison and get benefits from this Even a new job But honesty is not really enough Trouble is always around the corner and modern society doesnt permit you to make a new start easilyLove gives you wings or at list hope and the power to continue A beautiful girl of the streets is more than our hero is asking for and he is ready to do whatever necessary Even put his safety in danger to take care of her And she appreciates this In the end when everything is lost once again all they are left with is each other and thats all they really needFor the first time is his cinema career our Tramp will find a girl that will stick with him and support him Chaplin obviously felt with Paulette Goddard something that he didnt feel for his earlier women and I dont blame himAnd this story of modern times like all of Chaplins films will end up with an optimistic feeling in a unhappy end Never is everything lostWith obvious inspiration from Fritz Langs Metropolis and maybe René Clairs À nous la liberté it made the strongest point about THE where we re going in all the cinema of the s I think  and with only Marx bros Duck soup being able to stand anywhere close to it Maybe the most complete funny and mature creation of the best comedian of the seventh art with a lot more than a non stop production line of great jokes to offer If made without a single joke this film would still be one of the greatest of all of our modern times,10
884,tt0027977,Modern Times begins with a shot of sheep going down a runway followed by a shot of workers entering a factory Charlie is set down in the midst of industrial civilization which is dominated by machinery and in which men are organized into mechanical units Capital and Labor Charlies real enemies are no longer the Cop or the Boss with whom he can always enter into some human relation but a vast impersonality invisible and invulnerable Modern Times offered a variety of minor attractions it featured Chaplins wife Paulette Goddard; it had wonderful gags; it indulged in tricks of sound which came to the very edge of being dialog But what did the picture mean what was it trying to say? Because Chaplin charged his usual enormous percentage for it and because of foreign receipts Modern Times made money but exhibitors were not happy at the limited audience turnout For the majority the new Charlie was too serious; for the minority not serious enoughSince the picture seemed to be about the dehumanizing effect of machinery intellectuals called upon Chaplin to join them in reorganizing machine culture to some more human scale of thingsOff the screen Chaplin said nothing On the screen his anarchic hostility for any kind of machine culture expressed itself in scenes like that in which Charlie is fed by a machine and that in which crazed by the assembly line he runs into the street his arms moving convulsively like two pistons Charlie the rebel Charlie the poet Charlie the invincibly human had been turned into a machine,8
885,tt0027977,Modern Times exemplifies Depressionera America; a stream of disappointments tattered dreams and missed chances that attempt to drag the characters down but are defied by the ever buoyant hope of the American DreamScenes from Modern Times aptly capture the mood of America in the late s; men superimposed by sheep shuttled into a waiting line workers being pushed to go faster and faster eventually consumed by the very machine they deigned to control Yet elements of optimism shine through the weary filmChaplin and his gamin dream of a home of their own with cows ready to be milked and steaks crackling on the stove Though their realitya depilated shack Is no Buckingham Palace the two are able to sustain themselves on the American Dream of a more secure fruitful lifeSeveral aspects of the film called to mind a type reality Though  was written in   years after the birth of Modern Times including the large two way screen in the factory allowing the owner to be Big Brother to the workers as well as the police brutality and Ford factory line of men and machineThe film ends appropriately; dusty and bruised from pursuit hardship and hunger Chapin and his orphan girl head of hopefully into the sunset convinced of a better reality awaiting them on the suns return; a hope shared by many in Americas Modern Times,7
886,tt0027977,I saw this as a child and my laughter at the feeding machine scene was so WILD that I have never laughed so hard at anything again in my entire life I literally slid out of my chair to the ground gasping for air The whole film is absurd and brilliant crisply realized by a comedy genius but for me that one moment transcends even greatness and touches the sublime where is poetry and God Seeing the feeding machine again as an adult there are tears mixed with laughter To eat is to live it is the personal realm and the invasion of the authoritarian state into the personal realm is so arrogant and pompous that it frightens me a lot to see how far it has gone as they regulate our speech our food our sex lives according to the latest PC doctrines of nice Chaplin would not have recognized this new world of ours where the working class he represents here is ruled by progressive billionaires spouting inanities,10
887,tt0027977,The hands of the cinema clock were set back five years last night when a funny little man with a microscopic mustache a battered derby hat turned up shoes and a flexible bamboo cane returned to the Broadway screen to resume his place in the affections of the filmgoing public The little man—it scarcely needs be said—is Charlie Chaplin whose Modern Times opening at the Rivoli restores him to a following that has waited patiently burning incense in his temple of comedy during the long years since his last picture was producedThat was five years ago almost to the day City Lights was its name and in it Mr Chaplin refused to talk He still refuses But in Modern Times he has raised the ban against dialogue for other members of the cast raised it but not completely A few sentences here and there excused because they come by television phonograph the radio And once—just once—Mr Chaplin permits himself to be heardThose are the answers to the practical questions They do not tell of Mr Chaplins picture or of Chaplin himself or of the comic feast that he has been preparing for almost two years in the guarded cloister in Hollywood known as the Chaplin studioBut there is no cause for alarm and no reason to delay the verdict further Modern Times has still the same old Charlie the lovable little fellow whose hands and feet eyebrows can beat an irresistible tattoo upon an audiences or hold it still taut beneath the spell of human tragedy A flick of his cane a quirk of a brow an impish lift of his toe and the mood is off; a droop of his mouth a sag of his shoulder a quick blink of his eye and you are his again a companion in suffering Or do you have to be reminded that Chaplin is a master of pantomime? Time has not changed his genius,10
888,tt0027977,The mechanized and standardized world made of levers bolts department stores and lifts is too difficult or probably too ordinary for the honest and trustworthy Charlie Chaplin who always ends up trapped in his times But did this world really change a lot when nowadays we walk to the subway or we drive in crowded streets like cattle in order to reach our working place? In fact what Charlie Chaplin and the beautiful Paulette Goddard a close up of her face after The Little Tramp is arrested for the theft of a loaf of bread is magnificent really wants from modern times is a small decent house where to have dinner together an apple to grab by stretching your arm outside the window and fresh milk from a cow Charlie Chaplin doesnt need to speak on the screen while talking pictures were already widely produced since late s to deliver his brilliant view on s world; and even when he does talk during the floor show towards the end of the movie we dont need to understand what it is said to appreciate once more his talent and genius There are two moments that stand out during the movie the feeding machine that feeds The Little Tramp on the assembly line in the first part of Modern Times note also some similarities later when the mechanic assistant feeds his boss And the splendid final scene when before fading out The Little Tramp invites The Gamin to smile while walking on an empty street at dawn; a scene that alone is worth a full movie a smile that becomes the essence of the use of trying This last moment is full of hope and full of humanity; things that we still struggle for in our modern times,9
889,tt0027977,Modern Times owes a lot to Metropolis despite the difference in tone You can see this especially in the first half with the giant gears and flywheels of the monstrous factory as well as the twoway TV intercom the boss uses to give ordersAlthough there is a lot of serious content  strikes riots poverty police killings  the serious and comic elements blend seamlessly You never get the feeling youre being lectured about anything youre laughing too muchThe element of tragedy lurking in the background makes the comedy that much stronger When Paulette Godard comes into the picture the tone changes from industrial to romantic And it must be said that she is one of the sexiest heroines to appear in an American film more surprising since its a farce Id go so far as to say that Godard outperforms Chaplin in this picture even if her later career was less notableYou have to see this movie before you can understand anything about the art of cinema,10
890,tt0027977,Arguably Charlies best film  Maybe not his funniest but his best because theres so much more to it than the Keystone Kops kind of pratfalls that he so commonly usedFrankly I dont know how the guy did it being so consistently humorous without using any words  All of it depends on a story simple enough to be followed visually and on Chaplins genius for mime and situation construction  There ARE some words spoken on screen  this was his last holdout against talking pictures  but none of them involve people speaking directly to one another  There is a song at the end with gibberish lyrics And the rest of the speaking is always filtered through some mechanical medium a record player a radio a television set  Charlie was accused of communism somewhere along the line and pretty much thrown out of the country after which he lived in Switzerland  You couldnt tell he was a Commie from this movie  It comments on its time of course the Great Depression and Charlie and Paulette Goddard are two poor people  Management is shown as callus playing with a jigsaw puzzle and reading newspapers while the workers slave away on the assembly line  There is even a communist demonstration  But its all played for laughs  One of those red warning flags falls off the back of a truck passing down an empty street  Charlie picks up the flag and waves it shouting after the truck As he begins to hurry after the truck still shouting and waving a horde of dissatisfied workers silently falls in behind him and hes arrested  Poor people steal but they only steal food  If having sympathy for the unemployed is communism then roughly one American out of three was a communist because thats roughly what the unemployment rate was  Modern Times is no more communistic than say My Man Godfrey or Salt of the Earth or The Grapes of Wrath  Besides that Charlie is no classical Marxist  Marxism posited a transition from false consciousness the feeling that ones miserable poverty was due to personal failure or bad luck to class consciousness the realization that exploitation by the property owners was at fault  Charlie is no activist  He fumbles every job he gets  The other workers are hardly sympathetic  Charlies not a working class hero but a black sheep  The opening shot of the herd of sheep hurrying past the camera includes one black sheep in the middle of the flock and its hard to imagine that this was accidentalActually Charlie had lost a lot of respect in America because he had an eye for young girls  His second marriage resulted from a sixteenyearold girls faked pregnancy  Paulette Goddard who became his third wife maybe and maybe not was twenty when this movie was made and Charlie was fortythree  In any case  boy if you want to get Americans heated up just combine sex with politics  A surefire winner for the puritans  It may have cost Goddard the part of Scarlet OHara in Gone With the Wind because she may have been living in sin with Charlie at the timeI dont want to spell out too many of the gags because I dont want to spoil them but be alert for the feeding machine that goes berserk and shoves lug nuts down Charlies throat and hits him in the face with a corn cob Charlie looks as if hes strapped helplessly into his seat but his hands were free under the rotating table so that he could manipulate the fiendish devices himself  The first time I saw this movie was in the Arts Theater on Springfield Avenue in Irvington New Jersey  When Paulette Goddard first appeared the man on my right chuckled and said Now thats a goodlooking babe  On my left my marmorial ex laughed out loud during the feeding machine episode for perhaps the only time in her life  There can be no higher recommendation,0
891,tt0027977,Usually you watch old films trying to be generous with your criticism because of the huge difficulties the directors and actors faced those days This one is a miracle A comedy that stands tall even in todays cinema starring perhaps the best comedian who lived on earth At some parts it is hilarious but the social message Chaplin wants to pass is always there making Modern Times even more important The love story is also very sweet and Paulette Goddard is a remarkably beautiful woman! So what to say about this mans genius? Charlie Chaplin acts directs and even composes the music! And by all means he does a magnificent job You can find great symbolism and a lot of political references we all have to remember that Chaplin was accused of being a communist which of course was a pride for intellectuals given their accusers I have unlimited respect for the Great Charlie Chaplin,9
892,tt0027977,This is where I decided to have a look at Charlie Chaplin and his famous Modern times  we are all familiar with scenes in a factory but honestly there is much much more happening later and it truly surprised me that film turns into a such epic saga Another example of things I just assumed I know It charmed me instantly of course because Chaplin was a true genius and magician  his creation Little Tramp is easily understood to anybody no matter what background and we love him dearly for all his sweetness clumsiness and old heart This story apparently happens in Metropolislike factory where work machines and buttons are parodied mercilessly until we audience roar with laughter  I was honestly surprised that something filmed almost a century ago was still so fresh and funny Basically everything after the first start on the fast track was new to me and I laughed and laughed until I found myself rewinding scenes and enjoying them again What a genius!Once Little Tramp looses his job  there is a whole unspoken atmosphere of unfairness poverty and depression around  he quickly ends up in a prison from which he doesnt even want to leave However he gets Cocaine in his salt Charlie Chaplin on a Coke! saves policemen from escaped criminals meets ministers wife very funny scene and gets release from the prison with job recommendation letter And this is still just a beginning of the movie! There is much much more coming up later  it really goes on forever but its wonderful heartwarming and joyous to watch I almost forgot everything about myself and my whereabouts while I was so deeply lost in this masterpiece Film is so immensely rich with characters stories little details and magic that I honestly think its one of the best things I have ever seen,10
893,tt0027977,The Tramp Charlie Chaplin is just a cog in the modern machinery He is unable to keep with the production line tightening bolts The owner picks him out for testing the automatic feeding machine By late afternoon he gets lost in the machinery He cant stop tightening causing great damage and they send him to a mental hospital He gets out but he doesnt have a job anymore A red flag falls off the back of a truck He picks it and a massive march starts behind him without he knowing it The police grabs him thinking that hes the leader In prison he helps thwart an escape attempt and is released A Gamin Paulette Goddard is stealing food for the children Her unemployed father is shot dead leaving her little sisters sent off to the orphanage She steals a loaf of bread and runs into the Tramp He tries to take the blame but shes caught anyways He prefers life inside and deliberately gets caught stealing They get thrown into the same wagon and escape getting thrown out togetherThis has the iconic factory scene with the Tramp in the machinery happening early on The story is slightly random as the pair has one misadventure after another as they struggle to have the American dream The Tramp is making a statement of sorts as he gets swept up from one thing to the next Hes the cog that never really fits in the machinery This is a sound movie with sound being used for specific and interesting ways The Tramp is actually singing but its a lot of nonsense This definitely has a social commentary but its still funny message movie,9
894,tt0027977,A delightful film with one great scene after another Charlie Chaplins Modern Times is hilarious thoughtful and timeless  Chaplin combined his silent film skills with creative use of sound effects and music and added a wide variety of interesting and entertaining settings to create a film that is very pleasing to watch  Chaplins own fine acting is complemented by a delightful and charming performance by Paulette Goddard  And the story itself filled with twists and turns is a timeless commentary on modern life much of which is applicable to any eraCharlies Tramp character joins up in this one with a lively orphaned gamin Goddard to help each other through a lengthy series of setbacks and triumphs that reflect the stresses of fastpaced modern life  Most of their adventures are hilarious but many also contain serious social commentary that is still just as relevant in any age  Chaplin and Goddard make a delightful pair who win the complete sympathy of the viewer in their fight for survivalThe movie has one great scene after another from some wild sequences in a steel factory to a set of sometimes breathtaking antics in a deserted department store to the incomparable climactic sequence in a cafe and many others in between  The settings are done with great care and wit and the action makes full use of the props and possibilities at handThis is a wonderful movie that anyone who likes vintage cinema will enjoy Even those who are thoroughly jaded by the excesses of modern cinema should at least give Modern Times a try  This is one of the great masterpieces of Chaplins or any other era,0
895,tt0012349,While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplins later features The Kid is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicelyWhile its a fairly simple story this is one of Chaplins most efficiently designed movies  Every scene either is necessary to the plot or is very funny for its own sake or both  Except for Chaplin and Coogan most of the other characters even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance are just there to advance the plot when needed and the two leads are allowed to carry the show which they both do extremely wellThe Kid is also impressive in that while the story is a sentimental one it strikes an ideal balance maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies  Here the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorableThis is one of Chaplins very best movies by any measure  If you enjoy silent comedies dont miss it,0
896,tt0012349,Ive always thought theres a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies even unsentimental ones like Keatons The General or Laurel and Hardys Way Out West The latter comedy has a scene where L&amp;H perform a softshoe dance; it always brings me to tears Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that Im laughing doesnt dilute the emotional chargeOne of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already Why not marry the two things? Thats what he did in some of his early short films and thats what he does in this feature comedy The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie Jackie Coogan away Meanwhile the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesnt know if shell ever find out what became of himJackie Coogan about five in this film with his charming manners his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy is one of the alltime great child actors Want more evidence of Chaplins genius? Coogan doesnt steal the film from him This is true even though Chaplin as producer star and director makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boys talents Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles like My Boy and Oliver TwistChaplins storytelling—even with the foolish subDickensian plot twists such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed The windowbreaking scene the flophouse scene the dream sequence the tryingtogetridofthebaby scene—theyre perfect Chaplins celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselvesWant me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know I cant even complain about that Its too sweetly naïve And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the very few flawsOne important note children love this movie Show it to them while theyre young and youll make Chaplin fans of them And thats better than their becoming fans of almost anything thats being peddled to them,0
897,tt0012349,Wow is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so That fact that it still entertains over  years after it was made is quite a testimony It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama Charlie Chaplins unique humor combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember Chaplins humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stuntsThe kid  Jackie Coogan  is just as memorable maybe even more so He is unbelievably cute especially in those oldtime clothes he wore Watching the expressions on his face even as a baby are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent eraSo between Chaplin and Coogan and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next its an amazing piece of work This is a very fastpaced story which lasts less than an hourThe special edition twodisc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear actually astounding for its age Excellent entertainment,9
898,tt0012349,THE KID First National Pictures  a comedydrama written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  plays an important part his screen career Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIES PUNCTURED ROMANCE  a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies but releases coming once every two to three years A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in  eventually under the supervision and direction of himself Chaplins methods in movie making improved with each passing film Like himself Jackie Coogan Chaplins littlest costar and title character made such an impression with his initial performance nearly upstaging his impresario that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own becoming Hollywoods first important child starTHE KID starts off with intertitles A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear followed by The woman whose sin was motherhood titles much to the liking of a DW Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish yet in fact might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplins whose very name personifies comedy A young girl Edna Purviance leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father Carl Miller a young artist never returns to her life The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away Crooks enter the scene stealing the car discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else but after stumbling upon a note which reads Please love and care for this orphan child he decides to raise the child himself Five years pass The kid whose name is believed to be John now Charlies adopted son and sidekick start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money As for the kids mother shes become a star of great prominence devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts where lives the kid The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions unaware of each others identities When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention a middleaged country doctor having discovered Charlie not the boys true father sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child awayTHE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product especially for a silent movie made so long ago Chaplin who constructs his gags to perfection has one difficult scene that comes off naturally this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as hes lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot a substitute for a baby bottle back into his mouth Another classic moment on a serious nature is when Charlie is being held back by authorities being forced to watch his crying son taken away from him Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as hes being chased by a policeman from the slanted rooftops The closeup where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on filmChaplin and little Jackie billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin right down to his baggy pants Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances is so convincing that it doesnt take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp From this point onward he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor at the same time adding more plot pathos and truly great comedy routinesAs much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that followsTHE KID which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years was resurrected in the s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in  It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in  as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection double billed along with a comedy short THE IDLE CLASS  In the DVD format the two disc set includes rare outtakes and deleted scenes Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library where it made its debut December   during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights hosted by Robert Osborne and later in March  when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its Star of the MonthFor its age THE KID holds up extremely well thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan Theres no doubt Jackie Coogan  became an overnight star with this one film He was a natural While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again on screen anyway without them there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID ****,10
899,tt0012349,The Kid is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplins oeuvre Chaplin hadnt filled a film so fully with pathos since The Vagabond  and then it was in a very limited way subject to the confines of tworeel length Additionally Sunnyside  was a failure The feature length of The Kid also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags pranks and set pieces and with the support of Jackie Coogan its one of his funniest comediesThe parentchild relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment and for me not many have neared Chaplin in exploiting that formula in The Kid The sequence where they take the kid for a workhouse away from the tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the filmor of all film In addition to Chaplin and Coogan Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture Furthermore Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totherohs photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist but the musical score added to the  release composed by Chaplin taken from Tchaikovsky gives the sentimental parts its most verveOf the slapstick one of my favorite scenes involves the tramp in fear of a bully Its reminiscent of his Mutual short Easy Street  which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film Yet The Kid is much more than that which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplins previous work This was the beginning of the tramp as the sympathetic pitiful hero as well as clown thats so recognizable and beloved to this dayMoreover the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect Its also funny in a silly way Its somewhat analogous to the outer reality story although with much ambiguity I wasnt always sure Chaplin was making any clear point such as with the Christ image earlier in the film but that seems unimportant; The Kid affects the emotions and isnt especially aimed at engaging the mind At six reels with more sets and a developed plot this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplins previous films; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth thus making The Kid Chaplins first complete feature,9
900,tt0012349,It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as The Kid It is a silent movie but so rich winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words Chaplin and year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness And I really never cry in movies And the musicits simply Oscarlevel! The movie is sympathetic full of feeling touchingly funny moments It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over  years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age don´t miss it,10
901,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous His character the Tramp is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early th century but something all of us can overcomeIn one of his first roles with this character he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family Taking himself and this very talented young boy Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote directed starred in and composed the score for this filmHere Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own He hasnt got much but he does have love which is more than can be said for the childs motherFlash forward five years and now the mother wants her son back Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion Even so the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks things not used much at the time in the movies Using these little tricks and ideas Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the storyHowever at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh sometimes in the same scene This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it,8
902,tt0012349,Is there a way to name the greatest filmmaker of all time? Probably not to different people its gonna be different person so I can speak only for myself Let me try to describe my favorite contestant for this award,0
903,tt0012349,Its easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius but Ill say it once again the man was a genius if only at doing a certain particular kind of film You wouldnt ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film or at least one like out of Germany or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the s and s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and the usual kickedaround word manipulated amid the comedic setups Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the KidAs it stands even at  minutes which was trimmed by Chaplin himself  years after its original release and including a new musical score its just about a perfectly told tale It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that Dreamland sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful lightanddark examination of all the major characters in the picture now with angel wings and devil horns! What its about in complete basics is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she wont be able to take care of him and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at and the Tramp decides to take care of him he even names him in one amusing aside John Then it cuts to  years later and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows eat lots of pancake and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an Older Brother of a kid John gets in a fight with Meanwhile the mother is now a success not knowing her child is somewhere right in front of her noseThis may sound like a bit of story but its told briskly and without a missed beat in editing and Chaplins reedit tightens it to a point where were mostly with the Kid and the Tramp Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be playful absurd cute and bittersweet to a degree We know this cant exactly last but the moment the poor maybesick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic and yet partially triumphant sequences in the movies Its in a case like this where we as the audience tear up more or less as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out and then intercut with Chaplins daring dash across the rooftops to save him that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film silent or otherwise; that its silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true even a beat with the Kid playing with toys an obviously cute bit is great and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like ChaplinFeaturing some excellent setpieces just unto themselves aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that bellylaugh part with the repetitive brickhit to the head or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin and excellent performances from all supporting cast including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance its altogether an aweinspiring feat To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness,10
904,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid the cute little Jackie Coogan has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos and true to what you would expect of his best work does it superbly  The tramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding a little boy to the mix was the finishing touch  Look out too for little Lita Grey in the angel sequence who would become Chaplins nd wife four years after this film was made,0

It isnt just length After all some of Charlie Chaplins later shorts were as long as fortyfive minutes while The Kid is barely an hour No when Chaplin made his graduation to fulllength features he also strove to broaden the scope scale and above all the dignity of his work The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplins careerThe Kid begins with a bit of backstory as a few of Chaplins shorts do but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this Here we have the opening of a drama and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief Of course such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short but here that wouldnt be appropriate Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laughoutloud funny but they certainly dont belong in a straight dramatic setting And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room sceneAnd never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration but still very natural by the standards of the time And of course little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive his movements expressions and timings all spoton so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness and he appears more like a human cartoon character Coogan steals the picture with ease and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously asideThis too is an important difference with The Kid Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act famously severing his partnership with the funnyinhisownright Ben Turpin back in  Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own The few examples such as the routine with the policemans wife and the window ledge are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material However he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this outToday The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful featurelength spinoff If you look at something like the minute Christmas special of The Office it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode Chaplins full length features however were far more than just spinoffs and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work,9
906,tt0012349,The Kid became a critically hailed international hit A tramp Charles Chaplin brings up an abandoned baby Jackie Coogan and later loses him to his mother Edna Purviance; but there is a happy endingThe film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums The comedy is sparingly laid on but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest The production is comparatively smooth young Coogan is sensational and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced His inspiration it is suggested was the death of his own first son Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in ,10
907,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins first full length feature film and his biggest success up to that date is a remarkably heartwarming story  which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy It begins with a woman whos sin was motherhood who gives birth to a baby she cant support at a Charity Hospital which is kept padlocked from the inside She is forced to abandon it in an alley and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film as he is casually strolling by and then through a series of odd but entirely believable situations he is unable to get rid of it It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin who was in top form playing the little boy at  years old Charlies life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplins traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed dramatic story The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments sometimes simultaneously if you can believe that but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival and it is never once predictable all the way until the last frameThere is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy and in between rounds  Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well and giving him hints for the rest of the fight Meanwhile the other kids brother shows up a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankensteins monster than anything else What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street This is a slapstick setup that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time were it not for its direct relevance to the storyAt another point there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home as the  version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackies arms I think this is the only time in any film that Ive ever seen genuine lowbrow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident This combination not just here but throughout the film is The Kids biggest achievement There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about although my understanding is that volumes have been written about its symbolic meaning both within the movie and in reference to Chaplins personal life And speaking of which supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing I dont know which story to believe that it was because of Chaplins painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary I would bet its a little of both but the film is here and I guess ultimately thats all that matters In the five or six times that Ive seen The Kid I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramps real son either on screen or off Then again I am looking at it with st century eyes Some of Shirley Temples early films are also a little disturbing to me although for not quite the same reasons By this time Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films and after  short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond along with a few assorted others Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema,10

909,tt0012349,The simple lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch Id say that it is as much funny as sad and the music score couldnt be more accuratePerhaps the most delightful surprise was to In the dreamland scene So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated the scene made me question myself if at the moment I was watching Buñuel and not Chaplin It is not my Chaplins favorite but its for sure one of his bests Totally recommend to be watched Chaplin will never disappoint you thats for sure If you watch this one also with City Lights and Modern Times youll be ready to enjoy his talkies The Great Dictator a classic and the perfect touching till tears Limelight,9
910,tt0012349,Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five yearsIn reading Charlie Chaplins memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him The second thing was Chaplins determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be doneThe success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they dont totally steal the film from youThe Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid Hes the same rapscallion Tramp we all know but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp one of deep feeling and protectiveness Two people who need and love each other very much This film couldnt missFirst National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin the studio and his estranged wife Mildred Harris The Robert Downey Jr biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itselfTill that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid,9
911,tt0012349,The Kid was released in  at the pinnacle of the Silent era when emotions came to screen through looks and body language when we didnt need dialog we had faces And if theres one film where Charlie Chaplins face oddly illuminates the screen its definitely The Kid Sure many fans would argue that City Lights is Chaplins masterpiece but something is too perfect too masterfully directed it was made during the talking era Chaplin was in his s and had more experience while The Kid features a more youthful director It belongs to a whole other era and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed in  Chaplin was  Hitchcock  Brando wasnt even born discovering The Kid is like turning the pages of a dusty yellowpaged historical book one eye is watching the film while the other discovers a period And I dont know if Im the only one but theres something in the setting the location that makes the film look even older For all I saw the movie could have been set in the early century and considering the timing of the film maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin himself The film was made in a difficult personal time when hed just lost his son after his birth There was a great wound in Chaplins heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragementThe context of The Kid is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time which is even more impressive considering his sevenyear experience a short time but enough to create an icon the Little Tramp an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema Chaplins story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and Im sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame  and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a filmmakerThe Emigrant in  was like the first step back into Chaplins past inspired by his own experience The movie doesnt feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future and leaving the motherland wasnt synonym of sadness but the emotions were there beyond the slapstick and the comedy and waiting for another step back to finally explode in an emotional firework which directly transports us to Chaplins past He who grew up without a father and started working at an early age he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living before it cemented his talent he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin And this is how The Kid was made and for the first time Chaplin would become more than a simple clown and get all the respect he needed from his peers as a gifted filmmaker He could finally make his first masterpiece The Gold Rush but The Kid was this necessary last breath before taking the big diveMany aspects of The Kid highlight Chaplins past and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs  a woman abandons a child expecting him to be adopted by a rich family until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramps arms But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who despite the archetypal situations didnt make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt as is the father a nicelooking fellow and a sign that Chaplin doesnt hold any grief against his father These things happen and we shouldnt feel sorry as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos  the Tramp and the KidIn every aspect the Kid is Chaplins alter ego  hes smart tender funny sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing Weve seen so many child performances since  to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is and Jackie Coogan is one of the best if not the best almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy and that the kid didnt become as much a star as Chaplin is one of cinemas cruelest ironies The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense closeups on Chaplins face  his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen and whatever inhabits the Tramps heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himselfChaplin like Disney for animation handled drama with the same strength as for comedy the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy fun cheers and even some dreamy escapism allowing a selfreflexive approach of the magic of childhood The Kid is not perfect but its a masterpiece of sincerity of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music If not his best its his most defining film ,9
912,tt0012349,This is such a incredible movieAlong with City Lights and The Gold Rush this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin and it is also one of the best movies ever madeIt is true that for the modern viewers the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the boxofficeThat doesnt mean this movie isnt entertaining In fact I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny comedies and also way more emotional and engagingI truly loved this film It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldnt be forgotten,10
913,tt0012349,The opening title to this film reads A film with a smile  and perhaps a tear Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken for Charlie Chaplins The Kid has a plethora of smiles from start to finish and yes a few tears as well The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character played by Chaplin The Tramp takes the baby into his own care Five years go by and the Tramp and the Kid portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan are getting along just fine However a turn of events results in the two being separated and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his sonCharlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking and this film is one of his best His direction is truly remarkable being able to manipulate the audiences emotions so much without sound He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget He manages to make you laugh almost nonstop from start to finish and even wind up causing you to shed a tear Its so emotionally gripping and you just fall in love with these characters from the getgo Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinemaAs emotionally wrenching this film is its simply hilarious This film has some great slapstick humor and Chaplin is a true master of it Jackie Coogan is also great If I had to find one flaw with the film it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I dont really mind it despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film Overall The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute then tug at your heartstrings the next Its an absolute riot but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema Ive ever seen And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue its just incredible And not to mention the music is just stellar too Chaplin is a master at composition The Kid is one of my favorite films and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!,10
914,tt0012349,When watching this I wanted to give the film a  rather than an  simply because I do not think it is as good as Modern Times or one or two others However taking into account that this is  and the film technology is not all there I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done it could have been made a decade later and looked the sameChaplin has to of course be given a lot of credit for producing writing directing and starring Being a great comic actor is one thing but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid and they nailed it  hes adorable emotional and seems able to handle any situation,8
915,tt0012349,The worlds most famous tramp is back and this time he has kid sidekick! Sounds kind of gimmicky right? But it works perfectly! Chaplin and child actor Jackie Coogan work extremely well together Their scenes are filled with heart and you can see that they both enjoyed themselves during the making of the movie The movie has the signature Chaplin slapstick that is guaranteed to have you in stitches but it also has some genuinely sad and emotional moments making this movie one of Chaplins most fondly remembered from his gigantic and legendary filmography,10
916,tt0012349,A tramp finds an abandoned kid on the street He tries to get rid of it in Charlie Chaplin way but ends up raising it with road side values Child becomes an apple of his eyes in a few years but the mother comes back to claim her son I had heard that this was the best movie Charlie Chaplin made but I disagree with that statement completely No doubt its a fantastic movie with a very strong story and message but its definitely not his best I found the last scene of the movie a little contrite and compromising The story has been adapted and tried in very many forms Extremely sensitive and though provoking cinema A must see for all,8
917,tt0012349,I was hardly a Chaplin fan in fact I loved Laurel &amp; Hardy and really didnt like Charlie Chaplin until I found that I could impersonate him as a lookalike  Then while viewing his films for the need of impersonating I have become a big Charlie Chaplin fan  His comedy mingled with pasos and pantomime was unique and very funny; and this one is certainly one of his bestIn it a sixyear old Jackie Coogan makes his screen debut as a little orphan that the tramp picks up and cares for five years  Every moment of this film is terrific it moves along swiftly and made me shed a tear three or few times  Chaplins score is undeniably a great piece of artwork and the acting is superb; nobody in this film lacksespecially ChaplinI recommend this film for all to see  Its age has not diminished this little love tale for a family in fact it makes you realize family love even more  Youll laugh cry and have a great time out  Rent it  Buy it View it  Its a film for all to see,0
918,tt0012349,They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but Im not so sure anymore There has been a generational discontinuity at least in the USA that seems to have happened about  or  years ago I suspect that most people over the age of  could identify Charlie Chaplin and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinctionGenerally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation but Jackie Coogan is an exceptionSentimental manipulation there is but its mainly limited to one or two scenes The comedy is pretty acerbic Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again Thats not what passes for sentimentalityBesides Coogan is cute when hes  or  years old a ragamuffin dressed in floppy oversized bags of clothing so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it And the kid can act tooCharlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him which was all he had to do Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because hes too inexperienced to know how to overact Chaplain is good too of course How could one person be so inventive? Its said that TV eats up talent because of the constant demand for new material One of the better series Twilight Zone had about three good years of collaborative effort in it Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in  films and directed something like  of them and he was just getting startedIll give one example of a joke without an iota of sentiment in it to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid a big bully who knocks him about Chaplain spots this interrupts the fight and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing  go for the belly keep your guard up  and sends him back into the fight At this point the bullys hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says If your boy beats my boy Im going to beat you Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bullys chin and flattens him But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back Chaplain dashes over puts his foot on the Coogans chest to hold him down quickly counts to ten rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand  the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy Youll enjoy it Especially if youre one of those rare folks under  with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue,0
919,tt0012349,A picture with a smile and perhaps a tearThat is the first line of the movie as it begins and it stands true We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling Wow I cant say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story Now we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally recent great movie is Finding Nemo But whats special about this movie is simplicty honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into usDone by the genius Chaplin there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling we either smile or bring tears So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do are done there Winning over a fight from a neighbour meeting angels and all Now look at the editing in this less than an hour film its neat and precise The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film Acting is sublime by Chaplin only few can do what he did and even today hardly anyone can match him Its a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch atlas watch it before you die you may learn something you never wanted to miss Its / for one of the finest silent movies ever,10
920,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is one of Chaplins best films as well as one of his most famous It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by and its not hard to see why Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector a young miner during the gold rush After getting caught in a storm he hurries to the only shelter that he can find a wood cabin in the middle of the storm It turns out that it is already inhabited and by a tough criminal named Black Larson no less and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim another prospector insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film,10
921,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is pure gold  It was Charlie Chaplins third featurelength film and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris  which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp  This movie should be counted among Chaplins best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights which Ive also seen as THE best Chaplin movie but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedys immortal geniusesHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV I saw it again in October  as part of my colleges silentfilm class on a poorquality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen ,10
922,tt0015864,Charles Chaplins The Gold Rush is arguably his finest film He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich What he does not realize is that he may find love in the form of Georgia Hale instead of money In the end that may be all right with him The Gold Rush shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer writer and director he was Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the th Century Chaplin showed humanity love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career The movie is exceptional in every way Although I am not as wellversed with movies from the s as I am with the decades following it I would still probably call The Gold Rush the finest film of that year period Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today  stars out of ,0
923,tt0015864,The  Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious As an unnamed prospector Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner the dancing roles and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff His companion Big Jim McKay Mack Swain at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplins character to be a chicken and before long a bear enters their cabin In the midst of it all the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia Georgia HaleA real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!,10
924,tt0015864,To see Charlie Chaplins The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment One cannot help but enjoy a film as welldone as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered and I can see why It is a masterful blend of comedy drama and romance among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture Like all great movies The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramps flawless physical comedy He was a master of comedic timing and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians Ive ever seen Dont get me wrong this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler The film moves along at a brisk pace following the misadventures of our hero The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin of course as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska Along his journey through the elements the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen Tom Murray a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold Fortunately our friend also comes across a fellow prospector Big Jim McKay Mack Swain who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich But the Lone Prospectors adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere When he is forced back to civilization he falls in love with Georgia Georgia Hale the most beautiful girl in town Of course it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite the handsome ladys man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia as well Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the egomaniacal lady killer All of this would be too much for any one of us but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie I am a fan of Charlie Chaplins movies but as objective as I can possibly be this IS one of the great moviesEssential viewing!,10
925,tt0015864,This silent classic has many strong points  it has a lot of humor interesting characters a good story and good settings  Its the kind of film that shows how much a master filmmaker can communicate in a silent movie  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion but other than that its a fine filmChaplin himself plays the Lone Prospector and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors rickety cabins plus some other good materialThe version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin reedited in the s adding his own narration and deleting the title cards which gives it a slightly different feel  These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who arent used to silent films You can tell from Chaplins narration how fond he must have been of The Gold Rush and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art,0
926,tt0015864,Charlie Chaplins silent film also rereleased with a narration in the early s focuses as usual on the Little Tramp and in this case his attraction to a chorus girl Georgia Hale This is the one where he eats a boot along with its laces and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rollsThe role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin Lita Grey but her pregnancy ruled her out Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions Mack Swain appears as Big Jim who shares a cabin with the Tramp at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and goldrunners as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time as a sound film it is fairly good,8
927,tt0015864,Ive seen both version of this filmthe original silent version from  and the rerelease by Chaplin in the s The difference is that the rerelease was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies To do this title cards were removedhaving Chaplin narrate the film In addition Chaplincreated music for the most partsome were classical pieces sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVDit has both plus excellent DVD extras Otherwise there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out theremany with terrible quality prints or music or both The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the  rereleaseI use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film though I might in the future use it for my Psychology classes as well I teach both because Chaplins genius came from his obsessivecompulsive nature The movie reportedly had  times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than  takes!! The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century Along the way he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb Suffice to say the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch something not true of all fulllength slapstick comediessometimes their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to fulllengthThis is a gorgeous wellexecuted piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac The musical score arranged by Chaplin direction acting and cinematography all are simply perfectmaking this in my opinion the best fulllength silent comedy ever made This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keatons films!,10
928,tt0015864,If any single figure can fairly be said to symbolize the glory years of the silent filmsthe cinemas truly international epochit is Charles Chaplins indomitable tramp The Little Fellow as millions came to call him was at once tatty and debonair browbeaten and irrepressibly optimisticand he was without question the bestloved international star in all of film history His coat was too small his pants too large his mustache patently falseand the resultant silhouette instantly recognizable wherever movies were shown Charlie Chaplins tramp spoke to all walks of lifeand never more eloquently than in such silent films as The Kid and The Gold Rush The Gold Rush is superb It deals with Charlies adventures to win the affection of a local dancehall girl and his hilarious efforts to avoid being eaten by bears and by prospectors who are bigger and hungrier than he The most memorable scene is one in which he dines on an old shoe Chaplins exquisite grace turned the boiled shoe into a gourmet feast he carves it carefully smacks his lips in anticipation and then eats it with gusto and appreciation sucking the nails as if they contained the most juices and twirling the laces around his fork as if they were spaghetti,10
929,tt0015864,In Charles Chaplins  film The Gold Rush a lone prospector travels to California looking for gold and entwines himself in adventures and finds Georgia the woman of his dreams After many hardships including a relocating cabin the lone prospector played by Charles Chaplin finds gold and becomes rich ending in success and unity with Georgia The time period in which this movie was shot compared with the technological innovation and the state of the art filming techniques give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel The use of upclose shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a new feel to the style of silent cinema The scene with the cabin shifting and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin was one of the many stylistic filming techniques that gave The Gold Rush such artistic and ingenious appeal Chaplins ideas and his vision that he brought to life in the movie The Gold Rush make it a great landmark in the beginning of silent films and in film history The intricate but simple story of The Gold Rush brought about many distinct feelings when viewing It gives feelings of happiness during scenes where there is comedic relief and slapstick comedy and also can bring about sadness or pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Years but she never shows up It reveals how silent films can become in touch with a persons feelings making them feel for the protagonist without having to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot These aspects of The Gold Rush make it a milestone in the film industry of the modern world,9
930,tt0015864,One of the best Chaplin movies which means one of the best movies ever made Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as `Eating the shoe and `The Roll Dance Both the original version and the second release have their own charm,10
931,tt0015864,Charlie Chaplin is the Lone Prospector who goes to Klondike Alaska in search of goldThere he meets and falls in love to beautiful Georgia Georgia HaleIn cold and snowy Alaska he rambles forward looking for gold with his fellow prospector Big Jim McKay Mack Swain thinking of herA genius called Charlie Chaplin made in  this silent movie masterpiece known as The Gold RushNow nearly  years after the film was made we get to watch this genius in a tramp suit doing his jobAnd he did it wellBetter than probably anybodyHe could make us laugh and he could make us cryMaybe even both of those at the same timeChaplin realized that every good comedy has a little tragedy Of course I have to give credits to other actors as wellMack Swain as Big Jim McKay is not only a big man hes also big at his acting skills Georgia Hale is as beautiful of woman as she is a great actress The Gold Rush is filled with marvelous scenesThe most memorable is the shoeeating sceneChaplin on the dance floor is also something to rememberThrough the movie you can hear the score Chaplin composed to this movieIt works perfectlyJust like the whole movieIts pure gold from the beginning till the end,0
932,tt0015864,We follow the little fellow Chaplin in his trip to Alaska to find gold  which he ends up succeeding in finding love at the same time The first half of the movie reunites Chaplin another lonesome gold seeker and a moralless scoundrel in a shelter under a particularly horrendous snowstorm There happens one of the most memorable scene of the movie Big Jims delusion that Chaplins is a giant of course bearing Chaplins manners chicken and his desperate attempts to eat him; but Chaplin is saved by a bear showing up which they finally eat Then parting their ways begins the second half of the movie the onesided romance with the beautiful Georgia met in a dance hall How funny was the scene when she invited out of despair our little fellow to dance to avoid dancing with an invading Jake! How genius showed Chaplin to use TchaykovskysBeauy &amp; the Beasts waltz!

Women love damned $$$,10
933,tt0015864,All the best Chaplin films have one unique scene thats very memorable because its either very funny or very touching In this film its one of the funny onesYou see in this film Chaplin jumps on the band wagon to Alaska to participate in the Gold Rush Along the way he runs into some crazy characters and has to stay out in the middle of nowhere with one of them Since they must try to survive in the cold weather Chaplin decides to cook dinner What he cooks and how they eat it is the priceless joke that makes this film so greatIts not just that one joke though there are tons of laughs in this great movie So I highly recommend it for any fan of silent films or comedies Youll have a lot of fun watching itAs of now this is the earliest Charlie Chaplin film that Ive seen but it probably wont be for long I think hes one of the greatest directors and I hope to see more of his films soon,10
934,tt0015864,THE GOLD RUSH United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations So proud of his achievement Chaplin reissued this silent film in  with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself eliminating the use of title cards Then in the summer of  THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting stations week series of The Silent Years as hosted by Orson Welles from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William PerryTHE GOLD RUSH which is set in the turn of the century opens with The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin coming to Alaska A snow storm drives him into the cabin of Black Lawson Tom Murray an outlaw Big Jim McKay Mack Swain another prospector who has found gold on his claim is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin After much struggle Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests Stranded due to the heavy storm Larson finds himself chosen to go out for help While out in the storm he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him He gets away by stealing their dog sled but is later killed in an avalanche Back to the cabin Charlie and Larson almost in near starvation eventually make a meal out of a large bear When the snow storm finally subsides the two men go about their separate ways Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia Georgia Hale a dance hall girl causing jealousy from her suitor Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite As for Jim he has forgotten where his gold claim is and locates Charlie to help him find it separating him from Georgia The results that follow is classic ChaplinAside from a large list of supporting players which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis The Gold Rush contains many now classic comedy supplements including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlies encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement There are tender moments too including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Years Eve dinner with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for themWith THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplins most revived and discussed movie one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed including THE CIRCUS  CITY LIGHTS  MODERN TIMES  and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR  Since the advent of home video in the early s THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores ranging from the use of piano organ or orchestra There are even some editions that have no music track at all along with some copies running different time lengths and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout The  reissue being a shorter print with Chaplins narration not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics but can also be found on Chaplins th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a  comedy short PAY DAY Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection But in spite of numerous editions THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics  and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter  reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector avid lip readers will notice that he is called Charlie by his supporting players especially by Georgia ****,10
935,tt0015864,If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability t you a commend this film as well as City Lights  Modern Times isnt strictly speaking a silent film although Chaplin had no dialogue there  The Gold Rush while not Chaplins best film does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits it must be seen  Excellent film   version redone by Chaplin is a bit better but either will do  Most highly recommended,10
936,tt0015864,To be perfectly honest I wish I could denounce Chaplin more fervently than I find myself able to Right down to my fundamental worldview I am a Buster Keaton person the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness The world as I understand it just doesnt work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay So wishing it did only fosters more painThis is actually worst than The Kid in this respect Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold Oh though filthy rich at that point when in the end he falls practically in the girls arms he is again dressed like a tramp  meaning no doubt he is still the same person  but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul here he gets both There is not even the thought of a compromiseYet I cant help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplins cosmology; the mysterious elusive fates  seemingly random but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose  that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocksNowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside the reality thought to be known understood domesticated into order but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void So every step inside taken casually without much thought is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death Blissful ignorance the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabinIt is a powerful cosmologic symbol what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life With both gold and love impossible love with the dream girl as the chimeras that trick the mindSo Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside but either cannot properly understand – and confuses karma for providential fate  or he does is terrified and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy taleSo however wellmeant its a dishonest patronizing vision of bliss Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging but eventually benevolent whims of providence Its all made right again more than rightNotice how well integrated is this notion inside the film proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the pointofview of the tramp who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger souldefining mechanisms that shape his life that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lessonSo instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill just wait and itll all work out in the end It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the filmSure it is occasionally very funny inventive But were talking here about the more intricate mechanisms that drive a film  and film aspiring to be a truthful reflection of life life itself,0
937,tt0015864,This is the first silent film I have ever seen so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound other than the piano in the background in a  minute movie So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas acrossI felt like they did some of same gags over and over again like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove It just got really old to me quickly I dont know maybe because Im from a different time period and way life but the film just didnt do anything for me I didnt really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only  to  minutes long and nothing would have been lost,3
938,tt0015864,Make them laugh make them laugh The American comic tradition and American movies were made for each other Gold Rush is one example that Charlie Chaplin was the father of American comedy Even though Chaplin loves to press political economical or social messages in his films The Gold Rush remains true to its genre It is a comedy non the less Even at the end of the film when THE TRAMP receives a kiss Chaplin reminds the audience that she has ruined the picture with the kiss This is suppose to be a comedy!,9
939,tt0015864,Spoilers hereinI consider `City Lights to be a masterwork one of the films that every literate person must see This film is often equally celebrated but it seems to be a random collection of integrated ideas to me Some work most dontThe  rescore and voiceover is much tighter visually but sonicly heavy If you have a chance with the DVD see it in the  recut with no sound and subtitlesThe one skit that works the best is the famous dancing rolls bit You really must see three versions of this one after another Look at the original Then see the Robert Downey Jr version done in  almost  years later Notice how much more comic Downeys is because he uses a different timing and is both doing it and referencing the Chaplin dance Then see the Johnny Depp version of the year later which pokes fun at the Downey version and reannotates the original A work of genius overlain on a masterpieceOtherwise there are better silent comedies to see And better ChaplinTeds Evaluation   of  Has some interesting elements,0
940,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is a showcase of sorts for Chaplin In it he provides audiences with a wide range of cinematic elements from his signature slapstick routines to dramatic relationships The rags to riches plot was interesting and witty but felt dragged out While Chaplin is good at emotionally engaging the audience with relateable situations like getting stood up or competing for a woman the lack of serious conflict makes the film seem simple The special effects were handled nicely even by todays standards but the true enjoyment in the film comes from watching the tramp endure hardship as he accidentally progresses into wealthiness and sees his life fall together by favorable coincidence,6
941,tt0015864,Spoiler AlertThe Gold Rush is perhaps one of the best silent movies I have ever seenAlthough it takes a bit to get used to silent movie language youll be rewarded with a marvelousfunny and poignant movieSome of the scenes are hilarious and some really touches your heartstrings Chaplin as performer gives one of his best performances in this movie There are plenty of great scenesChaplin and Mack Swain in the cabincrazy with hunger and cabin feverthe touching New Years Eve party and finally the hilarious finale with the cabin out on the edge of a cliffThe later version which was released with added narration and music wasnt as good as the originalbut easier for modern audiences to watch,8
942,tt0015864,What a delightful film I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them like the eating shoe scene fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Years Eve knowing that he was stoodup I genuinely felt for him Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time Brilliant,10
943,tt0015864,The primitive production values the decrepitlooking camera work and the silent soundtrack with only musical scores to suffice for the lack of the talkie in that era does little to ruin the viewers chance of being entertained by this highly enjoyable classic masterpiece by Charlie Chaplin The Little Tramp finds himself in the Yukon braving the wintery elements bears and a psychopath all for the sake of claiming his own fortune of gold Under his expert direction Chaplin guides THE GOLD RUSH with painstaking detail of what life would be like to live in the freezing extremes having to shack up in a  cabin in danger of toppling over a snowcapped cliff and feasting on shoes for protein Amidst all the atrocities Chaplin being that likeable underdog that everybody roots for and loves overcomes the odds managing to make the best out of a bad read terrible situation He even takes the time to humor himself and a few ladies with a songanddance number involving two forks and a pair of potatoes,0
944,tt0015864,The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights?  There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator  There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramps world City Lights falls short  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what Charlot has been all about all along It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplins works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime  out of ,10
945,tt0017136,Technically speaking I have seen this Fritz Lang silent scifi before but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the s The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable apocalyptic fantasy and religious allegory It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers who toil in the depths tending the machines and the upper classes who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers The hero the idle pampered son of the citys supervisor Joh Fredersen changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria the Madonna of the workers His father meanwhile is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didnt see In addition to restoring scenes to the film the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version With these changes the story becomes much clearer particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis Perhaps most importantly a whole new subplot is added involving the heros dead mother Hel who was loved by both his father and Rotwang With this clarification of the backstory the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer In some ways it recalls the family backstory of the Star Wars movies Of course the real strength of Metropolis isnt the story which is pretty silly and probably wouldnt have worked in anything but a silent film but its amazing visuals which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to  and Blade Runner Actually though in most respects silent films now look primitive one area in which they have the edge over modern filmmaking is in their frequently grandiose production design Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world The models of the citys towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a s film Even beyond the expansive production design and for the time special effects Langs visuals are all consistently inventive The robot Maria provides some of the movies most iconic images including her transformation into a human being In a later scene she performs for upperclass men in a nightclub and as she performs a striptease that in s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs A sign of Langs visual lavishness and the studios that he doesnt hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a characters state of mind For instance when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idols head into which the workers are being sacrificed At another point while hes sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs labor parable and Lang gives us spectacular images of the towers construction and fall In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and overliteral but theyre what silent cinema does best tell a story without the advantage or obstacle of dialogue The story is a little slow to start but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that Ive seen In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films as the workers riot and sabotage the machines endangering the entire city Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than  years,9
946,tt0017136,Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the s? Sure some science fiction movies are huge today such as George Lucas latest goofy Star Wars movie but in  Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then And sure enough we went right ahead living the way we were living the population got bigger and more crowded and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society Metropolis was run by his father John Frederson the master of Metropolis He lives in a Pleasure Garden high above the level of the workers and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father given the terrible conditions under which they live and work Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic sinister looking machine The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devillooking monster  After countless workers are consumed by it no wonder this was Hitlers favorite film they are immediately replaced by other workers who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements If some of these scenes men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured and the rest of the workers keep right on working hardly even noticingThe way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated `Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups is a saying that doesnt necessarily only apply to stupid people as Metropolis suggests Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue and the result is still compelling today The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways except that the two films can hardly be compared  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least An excellent film Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten,10
947,tt0017136,I doubt that Id ever seen anything resembling a complete version of METROPOLIS before though certain of its scenes were familiar to me if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keatons HEAVEN   In any case whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration  I expected to be distracted by the restorations technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it  As exaggerated as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards some performances such as the Master of the city are amazingly nuanced and layered and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone The meticulous design of the film the unerring camera placement and Langs muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking Id thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity important = dull but now Ive come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been,10
948,tt0017136,Fritz Langs Metropolis is the first true masterpiece of science fiction in film You can see its influence in films such as Star Wars The Matrix Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Blade Runner and countless others Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were in some cases phenomenal I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is  years old because a lot has happened in film since then Yet if you look at the basic elements of this movie  its story characters artwork cinematography etc I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late s Also take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this The performances and set designs are going to be over the top That was part of the style Metropolis may not be for everyone but for those willing to read between the lines this film still has a lot to offer!,8
949,tt0017136,In the future the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes the workers who live in the underground below the machines level and the dominant classes that lives on the surface The workers are controlled by their leader Maria Brigitte Helm who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles Maria meets Freder Fredersen Gustav Fröhlich the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen Alfred Abel in a meeting of the workers and they fall in love for each other Meanwhile Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate themMetropolis is a fantastic futuristic view of the fight of classes When Metropolis was shot it was a romantic revolutionary period of mankind history with socialist movements around the world Fritz Lang directed and wrote the screenplay of this masterpiece certainly inspired in this historical moment and defending a position of agreement and understanding between both sides showing that they need each other I wonder how this great director was able to produce such special effects in  with very primitive cameras and equipment The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art My vote is tenTitle Brazil MetropolisNote On  March  I saw this film again on BluRay,10
950,tt0017136,Metropolis is surely one of the greatest films ever made  Its scope its reach its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by todays standards of filmmaking  Seen in context of its premier in  Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history  Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great and in particular Metropolis  A great film is one that stirs the imagination leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life and achieves a kind of immortality  Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria  Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings halluciatory scenes and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions  There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria  Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups  Lastly Metropolis has stood the test of time  It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre  The story itself is simplea Biblical allegory about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen  The film is anything but simple  It is immense and a rich legacy that director Fritz Lang has left us,0
951,tt0017136,I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie This is without a doubt the best scifi movie Ive ever seen! Let me explain my position We have all seen modern scifi movies and argued over which is the best ever made but those film makers have high speed film and computers Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in  and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must see for all persons interested in the history of film as well as just good fun for everyone The social metaphores as well as the religious and philosophical double meanings are a sight to behold,10
952,tt0017136,This must be one of the greatest movies of all time I found myself almost in a state of shock during the whole movie Everything was perfect The story was great the filming was pure genius and the effects directly from another dimensionI dont think any movie after this one have gotten so much out of the available effects of the time as this one Nowadays they have super computers generating special effects Sure they look good but its no big deal making them Back in  computers werent even invented yet all effects had to be done by hand or in simple editing And when you take a look at all the thins that have been done in this movie its impossible not to get impressed Huge buildings explosions flooding picture phones however did he come up with the very idea? transformation sequences robots and so on No movie has ever pulled the limits of special effects as much as this one Star Wars and Jurassic Park are also known as limit pullers in special effects but they dont even come closeThen you have the filming Everything is perfect The use of body language is tremendous the light setting perfect everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera Ive never been witness to such a treat in filming other placesAnd the story!!! Perfect in every detail Intriguing exciting and thrilling with lots of religious undertones and tyranic leaders No wonder Hitler liked this movieI dont know how the original music of the film was but the new music for the restored  minute version I saw was really good and moodsetingAll in all This is one of the most perfect movies of all time and it deserves anything it can get Never has a / been as secure as for this movie,10
953,tt0017136,Silent movies are not for everyone Neither are subtitles Those brave enough to view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between should definitely enjoy this silent masterpiece One of the biggest productions of its time Metropolis still holds its own when set design and special effects are compared But what Metropolis really has is orginality This GermanExpressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future modern city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern scifi Star Warss CPO was based on Bridgette Helms robot Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis lookalike cities This is a very good movie Its too bad most movies dont have its originality,9
954,tt0017136,Fritz Langs groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema How can a movie thatll soon turn  years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages The world has been divided into two main categories thinkers &amp; workers! If you belong to the first category you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if youre a worker your life isnt worth a penny and youre doomed to perilous labor underground The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself Its essential viewing anyway! Metropolis is a very demanding filmexperience and definitely not always entertaining But as it is often the case with silentcinema classics the respect and admiration youll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoymentaspect Fritz brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to recreate a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines Many supposedly restored versions have been released over the years in  and  for example but the version is still the finest in my opinion even though that one already isnt as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it Metropolis perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made  A Space Odyssey Star Wars and Blade Runner owe their existence or at least their power to it,8
955,tt0017136,Metropolis is my alltime favourite movie so Ive saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb Ive enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies Ive seen but now Im moving on to other passionsAlthough written by Fritz Langs wife Thea von Harbou Metropolis was originally Langs idea he was inspired by the sight of New Yorks skyscrapers when he sailed to America in  During his American trip he visited the set of The Phantom of the Opera and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasnt filmedDespite its epic power Metropolis makes very little sense The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen so why is the one named Freder*sen* the father not son of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwangs crude little cottage the only preFredersen building that wasnt demolished during the construction of this city? Von Harbous very long and unwieldy novelisation of her script establishes this fact but never explains it How and why did Rotwangs hightech laboratory manage to get constructed BENEATH that cottage without disturbing it?For modern viewers some of the plots incoherence can be blamed on missing footage particularly in American prints The distributors for this films original Stateside release commissioned playwright Channing Pollock to translate the German titles A major subplot of the backstory features a deceased woman named Hel who was married to Rotwang but left him to marry Fredersen and give birth to Freder This unseen womans name could not easily be changed for the American version due to a couple of shots of her memorial engraved with the Teutonic name HEL Apparently Pollock feared that American viewers would be offended by this words similarity to Hell so he simply excised the entire subplot from this long movieThe reallife drama on the set of Metropolis mustve been quite interesting in itself Mad scientist Rotwang alias Doctor Strangeglove is played by actor Rudolf KleinRogge who had been married to scenarist von Harbou before she left him to marry Fritz Lang the mastermind of this film In Metropolis Rotwangs wife left him to marry the master of Metropolis Id love to know how KleinRogge felt about the fact that his reallife marital and sexual situation was the inspiration for key plot elements of this movie  and I wonder how KleinRogge felt about knowing that the entire cast and crew knew this as wellMost astonishing about this gargantuan production is the fact that nearly all of Metropolis was actually built to scale with just a couple of miniaturesTrivia tidbit actress Brigitte Helm was cast in the dual female role largely because she was flatchested and therefore she could easily fit inside the mechanical suit for the Robotrix A more busty actress would have suffered constant discomfort inside those galvanised bosoms of the metal costume I learnt this more than  years ago from an eldery Austrian stagehand who worked on the filmFor all its flaws Metropolis will always be my favourite movie Ive enjoyed writing all these reviews for IMDb The joy of posting my reviews on this site has brought me many friendships and a few enemies Well you cant win em allNitrate film stock doesnt last forever and all good things come to a happy ending This is my last review here Ill keep watching movies but other passions are important to me as well Thank you IMDb and thank you to everyone who has read my reviews I will happily rate Metropolis a full  out of ,10
956,tt0017136,One definitely cant fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Langs vision even if as always with depictions of the future there are a few forgivable blind spots The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the s as are the flyingmachines that buzz about them; while the business dress of tomorrows rulers unlike their exotic leisure wear doesnt appear to have advanced one iota!HGWells criticised the film for its adherence to arty image over scientific rigour and as a piece of coherent science fiction its certainly as lacking as he claimed The machines exist to appear awesome and to torment their workers rather than to perform any apparent task and there is no explanation of how this society functions how it evolved or how it is sustained let alone of the incongruities that must surely lie behind such anomalous locations as the catacombs and the cathedral But Wells own futuristic film Things to Come conceived in direct riposte to Langs unscientific approach is tedious and talky as a result didactic in its heavyfooted philosophy and explanations and lacking in artistic vision Metropolis may be soft SF but its approach undoubtedly makes for better cinemaI am not however impressed by it as a film Masterpiece of Modernism it may be  but great design and special effects cant save todays bigbudget clunkers from deficiencies of character and plot and they dont save this one Ironically I suspect that its reputation has benefited greatly from its being the only silent film many of its viewers have ever encountered reading through the IMDb pages I see wellmeaning comments like Great  when you consider how primitive cinema was in  and once you get used to the fact that it takes about ten gestures to convey one sentence It wasnt  and it doesnt!As silent films go this is in many places agonizingly slow and repetitious marred by clumsy acting tendentious titles and overwrought gestures By the late s cinema had progressed far beyond this laboured pantomime in Langs case the heavy stylisation may have been a deliberate choice but compared to the fluidity of contemporaries such as Sjostroms The Wind or The Scarlet Letter Asquiths Underground or Shooting Stars and Murnaus Sunrise the film comes across as ten years behind the times The problem is not necessarily with the actors  Brigitte Helm as has been observed does an excellent job in differentiating her two characters  but with the direction and pacingWe saw the restored version with the original Gottfried Huppertz score; the latter didnt always seem to fit too well with pops jumps and awkward silences but this was I assume due either to the difficulty of fitting it to allow for the missing material or to problems in the projection booth when running a newlyarrived print for the first time However the painstaking summary of the various missing scenes only ended up increasing my appreciation of what a good job had been done in the editingdown in the first place! To take a single example where the edited version conveys Freders sudden recollection that he is supposed to be the workers longawaited mediator via the simple juxtaposition of three shots  the shiftchange whistle announcing the meeting the catacombs and Freder suddenly struck by an idea and rushing off  the restoration betrays the fact that a couple of scenes of mimed dialogue were originally provided to spell out the message at painstaking lengthIt is interesting to see how it was done but most of the cuts are either an improvement or a very clever abridgement and by and large I didnt feel that what was omitted had been any great loss In fact frankly I felt that the film was in need of further editing at certain points such as Rotwangs pursuit of Maria through the catacombs She screams and runs and screams and runs and is pursued by a searchlight effect; its clever selfconsciously clever the first couple of times but the repetition becomes tedious to the point of caricature Plot infelicities abound in increasing numbers culminating in the infamous Hunchback of Notre Damestyle ending where the mad scientist carries off the girl across the roof of the cathedral hotly pursued by Our Hero which raised giggles in a hitherto serious and respectful audience with which I couldnt help but sympathiseThis is a film to see once in a lifetime so that you can say that you have seen it  not least because most of the impact lies in the visuals But its all surface and no substance the characters act arbitrarily the plot is subservient to the Message the pacing is like treacle the storytelling technique is primitive and really all it has going for it is the visual flair and the special effects I quite honestly believe that this work would be better appreciated as a set of stills in a glossy brochure; an exhibit in a design exhibition This is not cinema as I love it  its innovative it may be Art but as an actual film its only a poor shadow,6
957,tt0017136,There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator This is the predominant theme of Metropolis and director Fritz Lang finds numerous ways to say and visualize his message during the course of the film The movie relies on repeated visual imagery to make its point and does so effectively even if tedious at times Particularly effective is the representation of the worker society as an almost single living unit moving trance like to their appointed time and task The use of a ten hour clock in the workers chamber constantly draws our attention as does the hangdog posture of the individual slaves who grind out their workday as if in a dazeAmid this rabble worker Maria Brigitte Helm is the inspirational voice of the workers offering hope for a brighter future by a mediator yet to appear However the Master of Metropolis John Frederson Alfred Abel sees in her a way to quell the underlying frustration of the workers commissioning his scientist Rotwang to create a robot Maria to plant discord among the workers Rotwangs laboratory would have done Frankenstein proud and the creation of the robot is a marvel of cinematic imagery The robot Marias belly dance transforms into a scene of such raw energy and sexual awareness that it awakens the statues of the Seven Deadly Sins one of the master strokes of this expressionist filmSo much imagery in fact is layered into Metropolis that its safe to say that repeat viewings will lead to even more interpretations of its vision and not simply for its denunciation of a class society Both timely and timeless the film captures a dynamism that inspires passion even after nearly eighty years following its original release,8
958,tt0017136,I really hate it when I dont enjoy a classic film I really want to enjoy it but I just cant I want to understand some peoples love for it but I just cant Metropolis falls under this category An unbearably slow film I watched the restoration which is over  hours longthat may have been a bad idea that starts off with interesting ideas but then seems to not really do much with them It is the year  the wealthy rule the city of Metropolis while the lowerclass work for hours on end underground in awful conditions The Master of Metropolis is Joh Fredersen Alfred Abel and his son is Freder Gustav Frohlich who spends his days with other rich people in a place called the pleasure garden where he truly does nothing at all A woman named Maria Brigitte Helm brings a group of working children up for a visit in pleasure garden and Freder is quickly enamored by Maria Freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shocked as an explosion goes off and kills multiple workers He reports this to his father who is disappointed his son was the first to report it over his assistant Josepha Theodor Loos and his assistant is quickly fired This does an immediate job of showing the coldness of Joh but they never do much else with his character In fact very little of the characters are developed in anyway Most of them are completely uninteresting and the setting itself is compelling at first but quickly loses anything interesting halfway through the film as the film moves at a snail pace Anyways the main aspect of the plot here is that the workers are led by Maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of a mediator to make it happen My real issue is that the film starts with such a great idea and had potential to become something like  Im aware it came out afterwords and that its a novel but still just an example but it instead becomes filled with strange religious allusions and becomes a witch hunt essentially by the end They never really do any decent social commentary at all If any at all This wouldnt matter if the film was actually entertaining but it only is in spurts and then quickly becomes a repetitive bore I do think the special effects were impressive and this film is obviously important for being the first full length science fiction filmwell ever That doesnt mean it holds up because it doesnt In fact itd be hard for me to believe the film was entertaining in  I still wonder if I had watched the shorter version of the film how much more I wouldve enjoyed the film It certainly wouldve have been paced better considering so much of this film is unbelievably uninteresting But I dont think that changes the fact that this movie doesnt really do anything It isnt entertaining It doesnt really have a message What is this movie? I guess good special effects for ? Whatever Im glad I gave this classic a chance but I highly doubt Ill revisit it anytime soon,4
959,tt0017136,This review contains Spoilers But since the story is by far the least reason to watch Metropolis feel free to still read it even if you havent watched it yetMetropolis is a film that was far ahead of its time It influenced a great lot of sciencefiction films and how The Blade Runner Batman or Dark City would look like if there wasnt Metropolis  who knows Even The Matrix Reloaded is heavily inspired by this classic that is as old as my grandmother Now what is it all about? About Freder the son of the head of the city of Metropolis a Christlike figure who falls in love with the preacher of the working class a saintlike woman who happens to be named Maria When a robot who is modeled to look like Maria makes the workers almost extinguish their city and their children Maria and Freder save the children and in the end Freder makes his father and the workers cooperate for a brighter futureSounds silly to you? Yes and thats exactly what the story is silly Thats also the reason why still today Metropolis isnt accepted as the masterpiece it is by a few film buffs But these people dont understand one thing A good film does more than only tell a story A film can be great even without a story at all and a silly story combined with amazing visuals can make you forget all the other weaknesses a film has And wow what amazing images Metropolis offers What an art direction! What wonderful special effects! And remember as I already said this film is as old as my grandmother! Just have a look at the workers They hardly ever seem to be individuals In the mass scenes they look like one big creature moving forward or backwards When they are working they look more like machines than like human beings whereas the machines resemble monsters more than they do technical devices best seen in the moments when Freder hallucinates and sees the big machine as a workereating Moloch We also see a worker and later Freder work on a machine that looks like a clock with  blinking light bulbs doing some that looks as exhausting as it looks senseless Or think of Rotwang the mad inventor who lives in a little hut that looks in this film like it was from another world He has a black prosthesis for his right hand its not a coincidence that Stanley Kubrick gave his mad scientist/inventor Dr Strangelove a prosthesis for his right hand too He builds the robot that he makes to look like Maria and that transformation scene is one of the most magnificent scenes ever and looks more convincing than some scenes of modern scifi flicks I also have to mention Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and the robot  and the look in her eyes would already be enough to tell which of her characters is on screen at the moment If something like awards already would have been given in the s she sure would have walked home with quite a bunch of them And just look at her sexy dance! It is just as memorable as the shot of the many eyes watching her dance  or the many faces watching her preach just a few minutes later Metropolis is a film no scififan should miss I had the good luck that my first viewing of Metropolis one year ago was in a cinema when it was a rereleased after its restoration I can only recommend you to watch it in a cinema if you have the possibility to as Metropolis is just as   A Space Odyssey one of those rare films that are masterpieces on your TV set but a revelation on the big screen,10
960,tt0017136,I was very anxious to see Metropolis for the first time I had been into silent movies for a couple of years but hadnt had the opportunity to see Fritz Langs classic I finally saw it at a silent movie theater in Hollywood and my feelings were to say the least mixedThe film is visually stunning Monumental sets brilliantly directed scenes amazing special effects by the standards of the time In fact I might say that I was more enthralled by the visual effects of this movie than I was by say Lord of the Rings or Avatar Whereas Cameron and Jackson used CGI to make their visions come true; Lang had to use camera trickery paint and woodThis movie no doubt set the lexicon for the SciFi and blockbuster genre in stone The images of Metropolis have been repeated in innumerable movies The scene of the underground city being flooded has curious similarities to James Camerons Titanic Even the villainous Rotwang can be seen in the characters Dr Strangelove and Doc Brown from Back to the FutureBut then theres the story And the dialogue And the acting which is overwrought even by the standards of the time But I dont have enough room to go into thatStarting with the opening line LookThese are your brothers a violent cringe would run through my body every time the intertitles would appearThe later line about the head and hands needing the heart as mediator caused a huge outburst of laughter in the theater This serves as the basis for the moral of the story which was eerily similar to How the Grinch Stole Christmas Essentially it can boiled down to this Somebody according to writer Thea von Harbous later beliefs this turned out to be Adolf Hitler needs to appeal to the hearts of capitalist managers and tell them to be nice to their workers The outcome is a grudging handshake between the head manager Joh Frederson and the leader of the workers Grot; and thus begins a shining new day!Metropolis also incorporates religious symbolism which is to say the very least heavyhanded Scenes of the Seven Deadly Sins The Tower of Babel an altar to Moloch and the Flood all warn of doom to decadent societies that exploit the weak and kill the righteousIn the end this muddled mixture of Socialist calls for justice and Christian Apocalypticism creates a political message that Lang himself described as sillyI recommend this film for its artistic brilliance and groundbreaking techniques But dont go into this expecting an award quality filmIf you want to get into silent film this is a relatively easy one to get start with However I dont know if thats a good or a bad thing Ive met too many people whove said that Metropolis was the best silent movie theyve ever seen; which probably means that it was the only one that they ever bothered to watch I would recommend Sunrise or City Lights as a first over this,5
961,tt0017136,Francis Ford Coppola once said that Apocalypse Now wasnt just about Vietnam is was Vietnam In a similar way Metropolis isnt just about the Twentieth Century it is the Twentieth Century Almost every image in it reflects or more often predicts the realities of life in the West over the past hundred years in a way that is truly uncannyFrom small details  the traffic jams and blackouts that plague city dwellers  to major historical events  the climactic flood predicts every industrial disaster that has destroyed the lives of thousands of workers from Chernobyl to the Bhopal disaster whilst Fredersens vision of workers being fed to Moloch cant help but bring to mind the holocaust  Metropolis feels prescient in any number of ways In the image of the Manhattan skyline Lang really did find the perfect symbol of the coming century  progressive new faceless oppressiveThis is far from the simple Marxist fable it is often taken for  although the Socialist message can hardly be ignored Its also a Christian parable Maria flanked by crosses is counterbalanced by the Machine brought to life under a pentagram informed by the book of Revelation; a retelling of the Orpheus myth with Freder as Orpheus and Maria as Eurydice lost in the underworld; and a Kafkaesque nightmare of depersonalisation although the Gothic expressionistic production design is a long way from Kafkas more sterile styleIts also lest we forget a silly adventuremelodrama with a mad scientist an evil twin a bad father with a noble son and an impossibly virtuous idealised heroine In many ways it anticipates Star Wars in dressing up mythic standards with Science Fiction tropes  with Fredersen as the misguided King Freder as the handsome Prince Maria the goodhearted peasants daughter Rotwang as a scheming sorcerer and the Machine as the wicked witch appropriately burnt at the stake by the villagersThe MachineMan a confusing name for a construction so obviously feminine is the single most indelible image of the film; the scene in which Rotwang brings her to life for the first time is a real moment of magic and awe untarnished by eighty subsequent years of cinematic showmanship Even better is the scene in which she becomes a duplicate of Maria  such an obvious influence on James Whales Frankenstein that its hard not to shout out Its alive! The optical effects are years ahead of their time certainly the best of their kind until the sixties at least It also marks the beginning of Brigitte Helms truly extraordinary turn as the false MariaThis is only the third silent film Ive seen after Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and its taken me a while to acclimatise to the acting style which can seem close to parody What it really reminds me of however is modern dance which similarly seeks to communicate with the audience visually rather than verbally Metropolis encourages this comparison with the highly choreographed movements of the workers operating the machinery Bearing this in mind Helm is hugely impressive in multiple roles Maria could be a rather dull and virtuous heroine she enters the film surrounded by poor children in rags but Helm invests her with enormous energy and expressiveness It helps that the script allows her to take an unusually proactive role for a female character organising workers meetings and racing to the rescue of the endangered children However it is her performance as bad Maria vamping up a storm that lingers in the memory  the twitching jerking movements of her head and body the Anne Robinson style halfwink that changes the shape of her face that malicious little grin that makes it hard not to root for her mischief The entirely weird erotic dance that she performs isnt technically very good or erotic but it is utterly unforgettable Subtextually shes the Whore of BabylonThe other performances are mainly very good particularly Alfred Abel as Fredersen proving that it is possible to underplay in a silent film Only Rudolf KleinRogge hits any wrong notes  difficult as it undoubtedly must be to play a mad scientist in a silent film with subtlety some of his more unrestrained gesticulations leave you worried about the safety of the other actorsUltimately though it all inevitably comes back to the imagery Langs film remains unmatched even today Pick a scene any scene  the synchronised shuffling crowds at the shift change; our first sighting of the Metropolis all biplanes skyscrapers and suspended motorways; the vision of Moloch; the MachineMan awakening; Maria pursued along a pitchblack tunnel by a beam of light; the statue of Death coming to life in the Cathedral; disembodied eyes entranced by the twitching false Maria; the crowds swarming up the steps in the Tower of Babel section; the lifts crashing down one by one; desperate children crowding around Maria as the floodwaters close in; and most of all false Maria laughing as she burns on her pyre then transforming back to her metal visage No film before or since matches this for spectacle And if in order to appreciate it you have to swallow a little treacle about the heart being the mediator between head and hands well trust me its worth it,9
962,tt0017136,We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Langs Metropolis are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upperclass and operated by slavelike poor The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan These elements can be found in this films ancestors Frankenstein Batman Gattaca and the cities of Blade Runner Star Wars and The Fifth Element All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Langs workMetropolis has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes After its success in  the film has had an uneasy time Its pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in  Unless a lost version surfaces as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentinos  film Beyond the Rocks the complete work my never be seen again The restored version released on DVD in  was based on a digital restoration at K resolution from all available sources Its the best version that Ive seen and I would highly recommend that one if you havent seen the film The worst is a  print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration the film in grainy and difficult to see it doesnt even have a soundtrack I call that one the worst because Im still a little ambivalent about the  restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting good sound effects not so good and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy Freddy Mercury Bonnie Tyler Adam Ant and Pat Benatar yuck!Those who study the film myself included find the story impenetrable Some films you can easily decipher but Metropolis has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that its hard to pin it down as a whole Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the films chaotic nature It takes place in the future restored versions offer title cards that suggest that its the year  but I dont go by that in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers the Gothic sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives dancing in their penthouses and spending their money The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step They dont so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses slaves building his pyramids The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another One person that isnt ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his officeHis son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the workers children Curious he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there The woman is Maria a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be foundFreder uncovers a plot by Rotwang the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms This leads to the films most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzyThen all Hell breaks loose but the rest I must leave to you to discoverLang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film and therefore less successful the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers At one point Freder disguised as a worker witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen Another suggests an odd device a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around its edge The machine doesnt seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless dayThe film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism astonishing in its use of light and shadow One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in Another brilliant moment comes with Marias erotic dance as the men gawk the camera filled with their moist eyes This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home videoOther moments have deeper resonance There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves Walking to work they march with their heads down dressed in uniforms and caps It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler More obvious are Langs biblical references The rise of the city parallels Marias retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel The giant pentagram in Rotwangs lab as he plays God The breathtaking image of the plaguebringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself There is even a Christlike quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakersThese elements and images are brought to the film because of Langs insistence on no less then absolute perfection He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster working his cast and crew like a dictator He cast some  extras  of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone and worked them from morning till night The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with himI could go on and on this film all great films invite lengthy discussions It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over But when you get down to it the best way to view Metropolis is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of its time Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad,0
963,tt0017136,This truly is a classic masterpiece and honestly one of the best movies ever made The story is brilliant and the visuals amazingI have seen the German  minutes version of the movie without subtitles Yes its a long watch but its worth every second of it Basically only reason why the movie is so long is because they need about ten hand gestures to speak one sentence Its kind of dreadful to look at first but once youre used to it it shouldnt trouble you anymoreIn many ways this movie can be regarded as the Blade Runner of the s Metropolis is set in a futuristic world that has a same kind of atmosphere as in Blade Runner The mix of s cars and propellerplanes with futuristic machines highways buildings and androids is very unusual but an absolutely awesome thing to look at The movie was ahead of its time and in some ways also propheticThe story is absolutely the best thing of the movie Also the way the story is told and directed by Fritz Lang deserves credit The story is tense and has quite some symbolism layers and storylines but remains always easy to follow The ending is truly spectacular and tense The way how spectacular and tense the ending and the entire movie in general was really surprised me in a positive wayThe sets are obviously fake and miniatures at times but they still manage to convince and impress Further more the movie is filled with some fantastic and very convincing early special effectsMan who also deserves credit is Alfred Abel Wow what a great actor he was in this movieAn absolute must see and one of the best movies of all time/http//bobafettblogspotcom/,10
964,tt0017136,MetropolisMetropolis is one of the most exciting and exceptional works of art that humankind has produced This epic science fiction film is one of Germanys famous silent movies created by Fritz Lang and liberated in  the period between the two World WarsThis movie represents the expressionist cinema and shows us the repression of human needs by the machine age Langs creation of a selfdestructive society is a protest against the machine age Metropolis is one of the most magnificent cities of  is kept alive by the unceasing work of the underground people who live in slavery and is enjoyed by wealthy and educated people The Austrian director of the movie Fritz Lang presents the story of a master John Federsen who sees people as machines working constantly to maintain the luxury and technology of his metropolis On the other side his son Freder falls in love with one of the underground workers who is a spiritual leader for the slaves The son recognizes the unsentimental heart of his father and starts a revolution The city gets flooded and Maria Freders love regains the workers trust after a robot had stolen her identity she finds her loved one after saving the citys children and the workers shake hands with the masterExpressionism tries to simplify the world and to understand it emotionally in a subjective way It is very important to understand this definition of this dynamic violent and distorted movement in order to understand that Lang tried to externalize his own internal vision of the world through simple expressions The name metropolis comes from the Greeks and means mothercity It has this significance because a metropolis is the biggest form of a technologically and economically developed city Nevertheless referring to the movie name this film can be considered as the mother city of all cinematic clichés In this story there are two main characters Maria and Freder These two characters are also the heroes of the story because they are the ones who rescue the population from being drowned in the flood John Federson is a person full of empowering feelings who only thinks of himself and of his city forgetting about the ones who work for him All the fantasies that he has come true through the power of his workers but he never thinks about the danger they are in while working for him This man wants so much power that he is almost hypnotized by it; he is obsessed and possessed by the power of inventions and creationsOn the other hand Maria is just a symbol of munificence her soul is pure and she is seen like an angel who brings peace to the world Maria convoys the people in a church settling area She is shown as sanctity a holy person that is surrounded by the light of the candles She is positioned higher than the workers who carefully listen to her as she speaks about peace unity and their salvation by a mediator that will soon come Her eyes inspire confidence and kindness as she kisses Freder in the church scene In general all she does is for the good of humanity One thing that she repeats in the movie is Between the head and hands there must be a heart  This means that she realizes the bad things that the head John Frederson does and the good things that the hands workers do But she knows that these workers should not be treated poorly or like robots and that she can be the heart which can persuade the head and the hands to cooperate to come to common interests Maria as her name suggests is also a biblical motif She explains to the workers the story of the Tower of Babel The workers in the story destroy this tower which parallels how the movie will end with the destruction of the machines by the workforce Maria is still the representation of Jesus mother because she is trying to save the lives of the underground children She would sacrifice herself and alike Mother Mary she has a strong faith in the creator of the world All the scenes of this film are perfectly created at the eye level so that anyone is able to view the action However there is also a birds eye view at the beginning of the movie as the panorama of the city is shown from high above the ground This view was created to give us an impression of how widely extended and huge Metropolis is In addition the focus of the dramatic camera angles with bold shadows is on the disproportioned landscape as well as on the rightangled buildings There are moments in which the camera focuses on fast movement scenes like the dancing of the robot in the nightclub and scenes where it focuses on slow movement like in the beginning of the film where the slaves are shown going into the working area at a certain pace and aligned as robots When more people are involved in a scene like the one in which all the children are surrounding Maria as she rings the danger bell the angles are vertical triangular but when only one person is focused there is a closeup to allow us to read that characters expressions and feelings A good example would be the closeups on the master Fredersons eyes as he asks his secretary why his son was allowed to go underground and as well after that scene when he is thinking in order to suggest this dictators meditation and frustration Another important aspect of the camera and of Expressionism that I have remarked was the scene in which the mad scientist tries to run away from Freder and kidnaps Maria He is walking up on the roof of a sharpangled building holding Maria under his arm as if nothing would happen The same scene was notable in Robert Wienes film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari as Cesare walks up on the roof with the kidnapped fiancé and the city crowd follows himTime also is significant in the film because the clock keeps showing up in the most important scenes Time is evident in Fredersons office as his son challenges him to have mercy for the people as well as he is talking to his secretary Still only a small portion of the clock is shown in these shots and it means the time in which the master can think what decisions to take On the other hand a gigantic clock is shown as Freder finds an exhausted worker trying to turn a wallclock Freder understands the struggle of this man and replaces him There is where he finds out that at  pm Maria will have a meetingBut all that we have seen in this movie is not only made to show us the great importance of this silent SF film that can keep the watcher alive by its impressive music and can inspire contemporary movies like Matrix  but for its great historical importance Fritz Lang expressed a social life in this movie as well as a political one After WWI when Germany had lost a war peoples lives were a disaster Everyone was disoriented and could not keep up with the tragedy that was going on and maybe there were some influences of the great antiSemitism that was supposed to follow But Germany was a great disaster as well and there was nothing it could have done to prevent it because many troubles kept adding up over the years and this country had to be defeated morally and politically as well as economically Even if Germanys wish of reconstruction was as utopic as Fredersens wish of a technological city the postwar inflation had a big contribution on cinemas development,0
965,tt0017136,I typically dont like silent films but I decided to watch this one for two reasons  First I usually like scifi movies and second Metropolis had received so many glowing reviews that I couldnt pass it up  However my opinion of this film is below what most reviewers have been sayingKinos digitally remastered version on DVD is very impressive  The sound and picture quality are both excellent  However I have to conclude that favorable reviews of this film are likely based on nostalgia on the films influence on future films and on the incredible visual effects given its year of release  Film history buffs and silent film fans should see this movie  I thought this was a good film but not a great one  A rating of  is much too high and at # there are plenty of better films ranked below itFirst the good parts of the film  The special effects are excellent for a pres film  The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work the decisions they make and in how easily they are led/misled  The main character is well developed throughout the film and the audience can relate to him well  The film is visually stunning and impressive  The story of the working class vision of the future machinemen etc have had a very strong influence on many films which came later,4
966,tt0017136,For its time this movie has stunning visuals kind of Kubrickesqe in appearance especially the opening scenes of workers going and coming from work Its very strange with the group leaving walking with their heads down like zombiesThe set designs in here are also something that might draw your attention This really has a futuristic look I thought the visuals were fascinating This was German expressionist filmwork at its height I would think Director Fritz Lang went on to become a very famous man in his profession This wasnt his first effort but I think this might have been the film that put him on the map so to speak Several years later he gained a lot more fame with M At any rate with the photography sets and overall Flash Gordontype scifi look this must have been a real eyeopener to movies viewers  years ago I still think they look very cool today The music was also very dramatic at least in this restored  surround sound restoration DVD put out by KlinoObviously the eye makeup on men and the exaggerated motions by actors in silent films look a little hokey but I was mesmerized by Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and her evil clone She is something else! I also appreciated Klinos explanation of lost footage and how they did the best they could do to still make the story flow together They did an outstanding job I wouldnt attempt to watch this on anything less than this DVD which looks pretty darn goodThis is a worker story about a man wanting to trade his comfortable life to join the oppressed workers who do their thing beneath the earth in Metropolis Workers are seen as nothing but replaceable robots If someone gets hurt they get carted away and replaced immediately but some other zombielike human Of course people being mistreated can only take it for so long before rebellion Thats history from the days of the Jewish slaves in Egypt to today so thats part of this story too I wont say more to ruin itI dont want to mislead people on one major point todays audiences watching this Few people in  watch silent movies To ask them to sit through two hours of a silent film is obviously asking a lot I had to break this up into several viewings myself but thats okay I still enjoyed itbut it a silent movie this long is not easy to sit through You have to be a student of film or a big film buff to watch thisbut those people will be rewarded Over  reviews in here show you this film has enough to offer or at least take a look Now that this restored version is available check it out!,7
967,tt0017136,OK first of all Im not some kind of actionjunkie who thinks that the Rambotrilogy is the best movies of all time I am a person who think that other silents like Nosferatu and The Battleship Potemkin are entertainingAlthough I loved the previous movies referred to I thought this was one of the most dull movies ever As entertainment this movie cant go very far On a scale rating its abilities to entertain it gets a / from meAs a milestone in the history of movies it goes all the way to the top The special effects were great to have been made almost  years ago The editing was great It must have been one of the most expensive movie made to that date On the scale of how important a chapter in the cinematic history this is I will rate it a / That means a total / This also means that you should rather check out really good silents like Chaplins Modern Times Eisensteins The Battleship Potemkin and Murnaus Nosferatu,8
968,tt0017136,Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium and his  opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format a fully restored print on the KINO DVD filled with intertitles to keep the story complete that had me appreciate it more but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music ie Giorgio Moroders experimental cut it would still be affecting At the core of the story Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou the sides of good vs evil or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak is set up so strongly that even when it has its fairytale type of heaviness to it it doesnt seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults This is the kind of film that should work for anyone young and old as it deals with universal themes ie The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!The story leaves room for the visual style to come through Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis Joh Frederson He feels the sorrow and pain of the people and goes down to their level to be one of them He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women Maria played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm in multiple roles she plays without a fault who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freders father Enter the robot a marvel of a mad scientist who gets transposed from Maria and becomes the havocwrecker of the part of Metropolis I wont reveal too much of the story except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lapAmidst in all of this Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects cameratricks and of course editing if I wouldnt quite rank Metropolis in my alltime top ten favorites I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day cars moving on roads built to the sky airplanes flying everywhich way and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways But its not just the use of the models or the sets or the backdrops or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Langs shots which are all spectacular its also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene it also appears in other scenes I think Its little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages the superimpositions of faces and eyes in the dreamlike shotsAnd of course Langs greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story he goes beyond his time period in stylizing As I mentioned with the pacing being unique it was surprising though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M that many of the suspense sequences mob scenes/riots chases I knew that this is the same kind of styling thats used today for many of the most modern of sciencefiction/action films In its own way much like Stanley Kubricks  Space Oddysey it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling while not completely abandoning the storytelling form Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries and it hasnt been seen in its full form in almost eighty years what remains doesnt seem at all dated or crude Quite the opposite its visual expressiveness its use of time and character and action and its deliberate pacing makes it ahead of its time and influential and at the same time keeping itself unique Its a tale were all familiar with being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial cruel world which Im sure was even more relevant to post WW Germany at the time filmed with a mix of overthetop melodrama megabudget setpieces and designs that confound the senses Add the appropriate music and youve got a classic fantasy A tremendous film to see two three a dozen times over though some of those too impatient for films without spoken words or by the operatic dramatic side of it all may become disappointed or frustrated,10
969,tt0017136,For many years the initially flopped and consequently butchered Metropolis Fritz Lang made in the mid twenties of the past century could be appreciated at least for its qualities as the indispensable sciencefiction trailblazer in motion picture history What was severely lacking from the plot however finally emerged on screen again after the famous Buenos Aires reel find which brought a quarter of what was missing from the film back from the dead With the new painstaking  restoration effort also came a grandiose symphony orchestra studio recording of the original Gottfried Huppertz score  and the results make movie buffs prone to be blown away and this time for realThe technical brilliance and visual lavishness of Fritz Langs oeuvre was always undisputed already at its time and only matched by fellow German Murnaus ingenious approaches on filmmaking Theres so much and dense imagery that generations of future filmmakers would draw from this newly emerging archetype Among the unforgettable scenes are the giant heart machine which turns into a moloch in one of the heros visions the Babel tower teeming with utopian life the enormous sets elevators and masses and masses of enslaved and rebellious people the staggering creation of the first robot all set against the dominant dichotomy between  literally  those living above and those dying below There are echoes of communism here of nazi ideology of the dangers and abysses of industrialization technology and there are also glimpses of humanity Not perfect in all its components the film nevertheless has everything pioneering in it  and more Fritz Lang while having some reservations himself referred to the picture as a signpost for new destinations and thats exactly what it became now that we can look at the great scifi pictures of the past century In them and through them Metropolis still lives and once we revisit the original again we might yet be surprised that it miraculously still points ahead,10
970,tt0017925,Probably Buster Keatons best film and oddly enough its not even a straightforward comedy  its actually an action film with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure  `The General which is set during the Civil War is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray Buster Keaton of course who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army    and is turned down because the army feels hed be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier  However through a series of misunderstandings both Johnnys family and his girl think hes a coward and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier  Months pass and Johnny sad and alone is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North  Johnnys efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girls love  become an unbelievably funny and actionpacked series of events as Johnny tries to go from being a sadsack buffoon to being a heroIf you havent watched many silent films they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive as hes fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye  While funny Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well  His timing whether for a joke or for a tender moment is absolutely impeccableWhats also great about `The General is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldnt be made today  No amount of insurance would cover it  Keaton does all his own stunts and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General with a bike he sits on a moving cattlecatcher knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own  All these stunts are fantastic but its scary to think that any one of these probably couldve killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong  ,9
971,tt0017925,Buster Keaton once said that if he hadnt been a comedian he might have been a civil engineer He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics Its no wonder he adored trains the most elegant of machines and brought them into his movies whenever he could When one of Keatons former gagwriters loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this page of history to life His first certainty was that the production had to be so authentic it hurts He even insisted on using historically accurate narrowgauge railroad tracks which he found along with appropriate landscapes near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove OregonMost importantly the area had stretches of parallel tracks which allowed scenes of Buster on his trainagilely scrambling over the cars balancing on the roof to scan the horizon chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind himto be filmed from another train running alongside Buster his train and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Busters hair while smoky pinecovered hills rise and fall around him These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures and they put to shame all later backprojection and process shots models and computergenerated effects The quality of Keatons filmmaking is simplypun intendedunparalleled Every shot in The General is clean fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times The film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional just like the grave masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniformsThe Generals narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look Like a train it stays on track never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline Adapting the historical incident Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train Johnnie Gray rather than one of the raiders As he saw immediately The General is one long chase or rather two chases structured like the flight of a boomerang First Johnnie on a borrowed train the Texas chases his own stolen train the General He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines pursued by the raiders in the Texas who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high commandThe General is not Keatons funniest film but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs A number of the gags like the boxcar that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks have a long buildup for a relatively modest payoff But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings The cannon attached to the back of Busters train goes off just as the train starts around a curve so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders train coming out of the curve Riding on the cowcatcher Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his trains wheels so lost in thought he doesnt notice when the train starts to move carrying him up and down in gentle arcs stillness in motionI agree with author Jim Kline who describes The General as Keatons most personal film the one that best captures his unique vision spirit and personality In many of his films Buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero But his competent ingenious and athletic character in The General who is also modest tireless and underestimated comes much closer to his real nature There is a shot in The General of Busters eye isolated on screen framed by a hole in a white tablecloth that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertovs kinoglaz the cameraeye Keaton melds with his camera; theres no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies They have the same silence the same strictness the same strange blend of gravity and humorThe General might be the most serious comedy every made but its not a tragicomedy That as in Chaplins blending of pathos and low humor was something people took to immediately But no one knew what to make of The General Original reviews accused the film of being dull pretentious unoriginal and unfunny Even today people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing The General is challenging because it doesnt flaunt its virtues; like Keatons concise and economical performance it holds a great deal in reserve Take the movies most famous shot of a train crashing through a burning bridge for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film he doesnt dwell on it or hype it Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience never manipulates never overplays He doesnt show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents nor does he play for sympathy Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold But for those who can see the expressiveness of Busters socalled stone face who get his peculiar dry humor who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated Buster Keaton always has more than hes showing; you can see it in his eyes,10
972,tt0017925,It is generally or should I pun and say General Lee? said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keatons career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past but getting the correct rolling stock costumes weapons and props to make it look correct And it worked so well that Keaton never really could despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR outdo it In fact the closest thing to his best sound film or film that he influenced that was a sound film was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE where he returned to a Civil War themeTHE GENERAL as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE is based on the Andrews Raiders stealing of the Confederate locomotive The General and an attached train which was used to damage tracks and bridges The raid in February  was from northern Georgia into Tennesee It only lasted  miles as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial Others went to southern prisoner of war camps The effect of the incident far outstripped its military success The damage after all could be repaired But like Jimmy Doolittles Raid over Tokyo in April  it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky/Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhileDespite it being a brief incident of the war the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south When Lesney did it famous series of Models of Yesteryear the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was The GeneralThe story however was ultimately a downer But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period First he changes the viewers perspective  it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men but on the Confederates Secondly he builds up the story of Johnny Gray a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier Because Keatons family and girl friend Marion Mack see he is not enlisted they believe he turned cowardJohnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake the General from the raiders and the film has actually two chases in it  first Andrews and his men stealing the train and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking itAlong the way are many comic classic moments such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train or when at a moment of dejection Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase and finding Marion Mack there helping him are wonderful  especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired she throws away the ugly little ones Keatons reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful momentThe classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river and the burning of the railroad bridge with its destruction of a second locomotive It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history By the way the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest He was Mike Turkey Strut Donlin a frequent member and starring player of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the th Century Donlin who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases left baseball to become a film actor he had worked a bit in vaudeville Keaton was a sports fan and showed this in his film COLLEGE where he shows his abilities in several sports and hired Donlin This was the latters most famous performance  look at his reaction to the collapseIt must be regarded as Keatons finest film and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures,10
973,tt0017925,No one will top Keaton for physical risk and risk is what deep film experiences are all about This might be classed as a comedy but for me it touches deeply enough Its about a man who needs to prove himself by taking risks and being true And its by a man who takes even greater risks and is more true True to the spirit of the social compact here displayed as the chummy southHes always done stunts that amaze Many of his other films have things in them that if the timing were only a little off hed be seriously injured or die But this takes the cake Its almost as if he started with the idea that hed have three locos to play with and had a year to think up stunts And the stunts are so physical! And so dangerous And so so very effective His trademark is the deadpan face placed as a sort of innocent cluelessness Its particularly funny when you see the physical movements and you know that  they take incredible preparation and timing to pull off and  the fellow you see that looks so puzzled by the reality you see is the guy that devised and directed those stuntsTeds Evaluation   of  Worth watching,0
974,tt0017925,I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number # on the  version of AFIs Top  Movies of all time list It didnt make the cut at all for the original compilation in  so even before seeing the picture I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion I usually line up with the majority in most cases but I have to admit I dont quite get it with this picture I found it entertaining enough on occasion but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way its heralded on the DVD sleeve I dont think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy so right there my expectations were greatly reduced Keatons somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition dont help On the flip side I wouldnt have expected slapstick to move the story along either so at least I wasnt disappointed in that regardWhat I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity When Johnnie Gray Keaton dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army and pondered his situation while sitting on the trains connecting rod the resulting visual was pure genius The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnies thoughtful reverie and was one of the highlights of the picture for meThe other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge For starters I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb  unbelievableOh yes and I cant forget the sequence where Keatons marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a preCGI world its difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own For that Keaton deserves accoladesIn between all this clever film making however I just wasnt inspired The central plot element doesnt hold up for me  if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer why wasnt he simply told the reason why One could argue that then you wouldnt have a picture but for me it left the story on a shaky footing If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier the picture might have taken a different approach but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero Maybe Im second guessing a master but thats what I come away withConclusion  if this movie didnt make AFIs Top  Film List in  I dont understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top  At the same time Chaplins City Lights in my estimation a superior silent film fell OFF the list while The Gold Rush moved up a few notches I may not be a professional but I know what I like and this one just didnt do it for me,7
975,tt0017925,Buster Keatons The General about a man and his engine puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen From major comic situations to throwaway gags The General always knows what to doThe story begins in leisurely fashion A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray Keaton has two loves in his life his engine and his girlrespectively The General and Annabelle Lee Marion Mack Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle followed by two engineerworshipping boys and unknown to him Annabelle Lee herself He and his entourage arrive at the door; Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs slicks back his hair and gently taps the door with the door knocker Then he turns to notice Annabelle Keatons understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness Any other comedian would have done an explosive doubletakeNow Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor but the boys are there too Johnnie stands up puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave The heroworshippers are ready to follow but Johnnie lets them out first then closes the door on them This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pantsNow the two are alone Annabelles father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon the War Between the States has begun Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist then turns expectantly to Johnnie who cocks his head like a confused puppy She asks Arent you going to enlist? Realization hits him and he leaps off the seat Before he can run out the door Annabelle kisses him This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porchJohnnie races to the general store which is now a makeshift recruitment office Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation but the man rejects him Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer Later Annabelle believes that Johnnie didnt even try to enlist She refuses to speak to him again until hes in uniform What follows is a classic moment Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine Hes so miserable that he doesnt notice when he starts moving up and down until just before the train enters a tunnelTime passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General When nearly everyone is off the train having dinner the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine Annabelle a passenger herself was still on board She is now their prisonerBut Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen possibly by deserters He pursues the engine by taking another The Texas Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas but the Unionists think theyre outnumbered and continue to run What follows is the true joy of the movie two long chases separated by an important plot twist Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop actionI love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas At one point the car which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track reappears in front of the baffled engineer only to disappear later just as mysteriously We see the logical circumstances that lead to the cars seeming magic act and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied preventing him from seeing what we seeComic logic is important to The General In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable In a throwaway gag Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for itWe move to the second chase where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle LeeMarion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was She has hilarious moments The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire She takes a small stick and daintily puts it in Johnnie sarcastically hands her a sliver and she puts that in too Then in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping Johnnie grabs her and halfthrottles her before kissing her insteadThe final section most of it a battle scene includes the shot where The Texas begins to cross a burning bridge only to crash into the river Owing to Keatons disdain of fakery one of several reasons his works seem modern he did not use a model but a real train on a real burning bridge The crash cost $reportedly making it the single most expensive shot ever in a silent filmA worthy closing gag was too taxing even for Keatons ingenuity Johnnies dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers His remedy is only mildly funny Is anyone complaining? The General is a work of art and a work of genius,0
976,tt0017925,This film flopped when it was released in late  for several reasons First its premiere was delayed because Flesh and the Devil was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks Second people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian not Buster the filmmaker and director which is more of the role he played here The film was funny but it was not gag after gag like so many of Keatons other films Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South A title card declares he has two loves  his girl and his engine when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession His girlfriend misunderstands thinks him a coward and says she wont speak to him again until he is in uniformMeanwhile the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Busters train Unknown to Buster his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train still without the knowledge of his girls captivity by the Union armyForgotten with the arrival of sound the film revived  often cut up from its original length  in the s because Buster didnt preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today often with poor video and hideous musical accompanimentToday The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too SHERLOCK JR is clever OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious The General is both of these things Its story driven races to a climax and is fueled by cute clever inventive gagsBuster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in A Southern Yankee,9
977,tt0017925,One of the great masterpieces of cinema Buster Keatons The General combines inventive humor with terrific action and fine melodrama all beautifully and carefully planned and photographed  It is filled with subtle and wonderful details that make it well worth devoting your full attention to watching  As an extra bonus it offers a fascinating look at the Civil War era with many realistic details inspired by a historical incidentAfter a short opening sequence the movie divides nicely into two halves Johnny Keaton is a railway engineer turned down in his attempts to enlist in the Confederate Army and subsequently rejected by his girl  Continuing with the railroad one day his locomotive is stolen by Union spies who also kidnap his girl  Johnny first chases the engine into Union territory to recapture it and then is himself chased by the Northern Army as he attempts to return home  Both chases are filled with excitement and manic fun with some breathtaking stunts by Keaton thrown in  It all leads up to a dramatic and memorable climax that includes many ironic and suggestive touchesKeaton is at his best with the story offering him a perfect showcase for his many talents  His slapstick and acrobatic skills are given free rein and his characters stoic perseverance is a fine complement to the frantic actionThis belongs near the top of any list of great films a classic worth watching and rewatching,0
978,tt0017925,I havent had so much fun watching a movie for a long time The General is a silent comedy mostly slapstick about Johnny Gray a train engineer with two loves his engine and Annabelle Lee Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer Things are then sped up a year where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan As it so happens they steal Johnnys engine a big mistakeBuster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies but of course less old He is often ignorant of what is going on around him leading to plenty of laughs This also makes him a very charismatic characterThere are countless train related jokes The first one comes right at the beginning when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman in a line much like a train The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment The finale is explosiveThe General was a lot of fun to watch It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies and had plenty of substance on top of that This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever After my first viewing it instantly became one of my favorites It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies,10
979,tt0017925,THE GENERAL represents the greatest achievement screen comedy ever accomplished From the brilliant gag construction to the sheer excellence of the filmmaking technique THE GENERAL is a hilarious and amazing journey into comedy Written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman Keaton brings brilliant gags into the story The film begins when Keaton is told he is of no use to the South as a soldier but as a train engineer However his girlfriend refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform After the war has started the girl is kidnapped by some Union raiders on Keatons train and so begins the greatest and funniest chase ever filmed For the next  minutes the viewer is in Keatons world His gags routines and amazing slapstick serve to make this the greatest screen comedy ever filmedMatt age ,0
980,tt0017925,Ive seen one other silent movie in my life but it was Mel Brookss The Silent Movie so I dont know if it really counts I really enjoyed The General overall more than I thought I would as someone who was born after The GodfatherThe main thing that surprised me was the fact that I couldnt look down to write very many notes; any time I took my eyes off the screen I ran a serious risk of missing something It seems to me that the film even though it was long or seemed so it was very dense in terms of action I imagine that since the movie has no dialogue the filmmakers must make up for it by making it as visually interesting and entertaining as possible I am accustomed to more modern movies with snappy dialogue and special effects and suchmovies in which you can look down at your popcorn or kiss your date and not miss too much because you can hear pretty much whats happening This was a nice change for meObviously Ive never seen a Buster Keaton film and Im not even sure if Id heard of him before this class But I can see why he is so appealing in his films I loved his facial expressions particularly the stoicbutcrestfallen look in his eyes on the train when something else goes wrong He also has great control of his body as we discussed in class and a fine sense of comic timingI found the film surprisingly funny Many modern films that I think are funny eg Austin Powers Toy Story American Beauty rely largely on witty or outrageous dialogue for their humor As a silent film The General must rely mainly on images for its humorthe slapstick images of Johnnie falling over constantly the unusual image of Johnnie riding up and down on the crossbar between the train wheels the stereotype exploitation in the scene when the girl sweeps out the locomotive Im sure that some of the things that I considered amusing might not have been considered funny by the original audience such as the recordscratch lightning bolts,0
981,tt0017925, Georgia USA The American Civil War is in its second year and Johnnie Gray is barred from enlisting He is a train engineer and the Confederate Army feel he is more valuable to the Southern cause in his current role than in the army This frustrates Johnnie and has estranged him from his sweetheart Annabelle who views him as a coward Then his beloved engine The General is stolen by Union spies and is heading for Union lines Moreover Annabelle is on board Johnnie sets off after the two loves of his lifeGreat comedy from the silent era directed and starring one of the greatest comedy directors and actors of that era Buster Keaton This is a rollicking adventure complete with wonderfully thoughtout and performed physical comedy and other sight gags Some very clever use of the plot to generate the comedyThe plot itself isnt overly profound but crams in a lot of action and adventure plus some romanceVery entertaining,8
982,tt0017925,THE GENERAL When one watches for the first time the General great things happen laughter relief a neverending smileand that old sniff of old good cinema I must admit not many films out there give the pleasure this one has It is like everything just falls right into place Overall the movie is a perfect account of all the things that make comedy great Simplicity good and twisted plot a sense of the unexpected becoming more and more realDo you feel me dont you? It has been attributed to Chalie Chaplin the following sentence to make a comedy film you only need three things a park a woman and a police officer We can safely say The General stands up to it Well there is no park in The General although the landscape is used wisely but theres a woman As for the police officerwell not exactly What we do have in the film are soldiers Im afraid of telling you the plot of the story because I dont want to spoil anything I reckon itd be better if you find it out for yourselves Well lets just say that Buster Keaton plays the main character an engineer whose beloved locomotive has been stolen by Union spies From that point on he does everything in his power to get it back Theres nothing more for me to say butEnjoy yourselves!!,8
983,tt0017925,To watch The General is to be both awed and amused at what takes place The consensus view is correct This is an amazing movieYou know whats more amazing? Despite what most critics say Buster Keaton made funnier better films than thisKeaton a lifelong railroad buff is engineer Johnny Gray captain of The General a locomotive which carries passengers and freight across the American South When the Civil War breaks out he tries to enlist and thus please his girl Annabelle Lee Marion Mack but the authorities deem him more useful running trains When Union spies seize the General with an idea of using it to burn bridges and disrupt the Confederate supply line its up to Gray to save the dayNew York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall reviewed The General back in  and expressed disappointment This is by no means so good as Mr Keatons previous efforts he wrote People cite Halls review as a classic example of whatdocriticsknow but the more I read the more I agreed with him The fun is not exactly plentiful he wrote noting Keaton here was too much the acrobat too little the clownWhen I watched The General I felt disappointment too Like Halls it wasnt total; its exciting and inventive and boasts some of the finest screen compositions Ive ever seen The technical expertise on display is astounding Its just that the overall experience left me a bit flatFirst you have what Roger Ebert liked to call the idiot plot Gray tries to enlist and is rejected by the army because hes too valuable as a train engineer Annabelle apparently never learns this for she rejects him as a coward I dont want you to speak to me again until youre in uniform she huffsEither hes an idiot for not explaining the truth of the matter or shes an idiot for preferring her lover be cannon fodder than a real asset to their cause Anyway Buster does manage to make this play later on When he finally speaks to her he is in uniform an enemy uniformThe other main issue involves what Lincoln called the slows A lot of the story is literally trainwatching Buster does some brave amazing stuntwork and throws in some clever gags later joined by Mack whos no Sibil Seely but still quite game but its basically a lot of watching trains go by The craft here is in the precision of the camerawork and the splitsecond timing not so much the comedy In fact except for Buster himself everyone plays it completely straight probably because this is real history being presented Compared to other Keaton comedies it feels a bit straitjacketed by thatThe General is still a solid thrill comedy with some amusing one liners If you lose this war dont blame me Johnny yells after being rejected and brilliant sight gags like the fussy Annabelles rejection of unattractive firewood while Buster struggles to stoke the engineTo me thats enough for The General to be another good reason for loving Buster Keaton I just cant understand it being the preeminent reason Maybe critics cant really love a comedy for just making you laugh and laugh Im just glad Keaton made other movies at least as brilliant as The General and funnier too,7
984,tt0017925,Buster Keaton s performance in The General was purely enjoyable The story takes place during the civil war on centers on Johnnie Gray Keaton a train operator in the South Johnnie is not accepted for service in the confederate army because of his value on the railroad and suffers the shame of being home while the other men are fighting a war When his beloved engine is hijacked by Union soldiers the unpredictable story goes into overdrive Johnnies adventure includes train chases rescuing the love of his life a daring escape and a climactic battle This film has a distinct action/adventure aspect but at its core it is a brilliant comedy/drama Keatons performance is superb He has the ability to effortlessly change your mood and the mood of the film with his facial expressions and physical comedy Keatons character seems to make endless mistakes that work for the best and good decisions in dangerous situations It is easy to imagine Keaton as a major influence for a future comedians and I personally felt like I was watching the Mel Brooks of a previous generation The General was a fun film to watch with a true star Buster Keaton turning in a timeless heartfelt performance,7
985,tt0017925,When watching The General  the similarities between Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin are almost unmistakable The story was original and humorous and the performance by Buster Keaton was pleasing What I didnt like was the fact that the protagonist still was pursuing the girl who was so quick to leave him when she thought he wasnt brave and then ends up staying with her at the end He is too good for her I thought the stunt where the bridge gives out and the train falls was very well done and must have cost a fortune There were scenes where I found myself laughing out loud and scenes where I was bored So unfortunately the film doesnt do a great job at keeping the viewer glued to the screen but overall it was enjoyable,7
986,tt0017925,I feel the The General is a great silent film because even though the story line is relatively complicated the way in which each character played their part and the way it was filmed made it easy to follow I am fairly new to the silent film experience and when I saw that this movie was partially a comedy I was expecting something more along the lines of Charlie Chaplin however I was pleasantly surprised at Buster Keatons more subtle comedic style I felt that the film was well shot shot considering the technology of the day I was actually shocked during the scene where the Rock River Bridge collapsed under The Texas Knowing full well it was not special effects I couldnt believe the producers would spare the expense of destroying a locomotive and an entire bridge This movie is sure to be one of my favorite silent films,7
987,tt0017925,Buster Keaton always amazes me He was truly one of the most hilarious deadpan screen clowns of early cinema And The General even clocking in at around three hours is surprisingly watchable based on his physical performance aloneGranted I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything thats unnecessary but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments There are multiple points in the General a story about a Southern engineer that has to rescue his beloved from the clutches of the North in the Civil War where Keatons character Johnnie Gray has to stop his train jump out and remove something from the tracks which in itself can be quite boring but the way that Keaton injects physical comedy into those moments keeps me entertainedAnd its a marvel how so many realistic yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with Its nothing fantastic like some of his other films but its still funny And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversitybut he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and its just enough to know that he is frightened but that the rest of him doesnt react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny Whether hes pratfalling due to surprise or erroneously succeeding at something hes unskilled in and being shocked by it that response of his is winningBut the General does show its age a little It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesnt get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context I wouldnt dare cut those moments out of this film even if I could reedit it because the space always had something going on but at the same time this film if made today would be cut to oneandahalf or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly The plot and story are simple but exist more than to just help the comedy move alongexcept at the end when the first story was accomplished Then we move into a second extraneous but still amusing story regarding a battle between the North and the South that couldve been excised and still having a decent though simple storyI didnt really love the score that the DVD company attached to it which is a number of classical pieces end on end I think a new commissioned soundtrack wouldve better matched the piece but I guess we get what we get And on the plus side you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of itIs it perfect? No But despite the age it shows it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinemas greatest physical comedians If you want to spend three hours with a silent clown this is not a bad way to go /,8
988,tt0017925,Have a lot of appreciation for comedy especially the witty and sophisticated kinds and there are a good deal of classic comedies that go for the broad approach too Am significantly less keen though on the vulgar puerile style of humour that is seen quite a lot today the worst of it veering on the offensive There are many instances of silent films/comedies seen with Charlie Chaplin prime Laurel and Hardy and with Buster KeatonKeaton is seen as one of the greats by many but for some reason doesnt seem to be quite as well known even with a just as good reputation critically as Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy who transitioned better into sound maybe when at his best in the s an extraordinary period with a deservedly lauded reputation he was every bit as great as funny and as likeable His daring physical comedy and stoic deadpan expressions were unique and ahead of its time at the time and still amaze and are distinct now plus he was a bigger risktaker with bolder material and immense courage that most wish they could have Which perhaps hasnt been more apparent than in this film The General often considered one of his best and most important films or even his masterpiece though with other just as worthy efforts it has been debated and justifiably so This paragraph is very subjective of course and probably wont be agreed with but that is just my respectful stanceThe General to this day still looks great and remarkably lavish something of a technical achievement in its day It also should be used as an example of how to have effects that still look good and like a lot of effort and care went into them and also use them properly rather than overusing and abusing them to gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now The locomotive features heavily here and to ingenious and quite imaginative effect The direction keeps the momentum going with ease and balances all The Generals elements every bit as adeptlyWhen it comes to the humour which is very physical it is never less than very funny and is timed inventively throughout no corniness at all and it gels very well But The General is much more than just a comedy and one can say that its not really one It has other elements too and executes them even better actually especially the action the scope dexterity and boldness of it and especially those stunts absolutely jawdropping and truly exciting to watch It is also an example of how to have action that thrills while being easy on the eyes coherent and not being too noisy or busy something to learn fromAlso here is a tender understated quality that is very surprising and the romantic element is genuinely charming without being sappy The film also has a story thats easy to follow and at the same time is logical and interesting indicating a film with brains as well as soul that treats the viewer with respect rather than getting irritated by credibility straining and logic lapses Keaton is superb here not only is his comic timing on point but he provides a character thats endearing and worth rooting for His physicality and how he copes with the stunts is aweinspiring and he is one of not many to make deadpan interesting and entertaining because he still makes it very expressive and nuanced The rest of the cast are easy to overlook but are just as strong even if with not as much to do or with material that sticks in the mind as muchOverall brilliant and a Buster Keaton essential / Bethany Cox,10
989,tt0017925,There are some truly wonderful scenes in this film which is full of adventure comedy and some pretty impressive stuntwork on moving trains by Buster Keaton and the other actors The premise is that Keaton a train conductor has volunteered to fight for the South at the outset of the Civil War but been turned down When his train is stolen by Union soldiers he immediately gives chase on foot then a handcar briefly a bicycle and then finally another train not knowing quite yet that his girlfriend Marion Mack was inadvertently also kidnappedIn one of the memorable early scenes Keaton is sitting on the connecting rod of the locomotive lost in thought when it starts up bobbing him up and down In another he packs a cannon on his train with a massive charge and as its angle slowly descends before firing it appears hes going to blow himself up until his train at the last minute hits a curve and he nearly hits his intended target Its just wonderful There is also of course the scene with a Union train going out onto a burning bridge which then collapses one of the most iconic and expensive scenes of the eraIn addition to those big moments there are also innumerable little things Keaton does which highlight his genius He is just so lovable and talented He uses one of the large railroad ties intended to derail him to knock another off the track as his train is moving When hes hiding under a table surrounded by Union officers hes subtly kicked and jostled in funny ways As he makes his escape with Mack he stuffs her into a large sack that he had emptied of shoes only to lose his own shoe in the process and struggle to locate it I also thought I saw bits of Woody Allen in the scene where he urges her to be quiet only to knock things over and make noise himselfAmbitious aweinspiring influential clever and still funny + years later Is it the best ever? I dont know I liked The Cameraman  even more but still – damn good,9
990,tt0017925,Buster Keaton is Johnnie Gray a southerner who wants to fight for the cause but gets rejected because he could be of more use as an engineer than as a soldier Unfortunately hes not told why he was turned down and his gal just assumes that hes a coward Not so because when a Yankee scallywag steals his beloved steam engine the titular The General Johnnie heads north to recover the engine and through a series of misadventures becomes a hero of the Confederacy and rescues Annabelle Lee Glorious sight gags abound as Old Stone Face deals with errant cannon loose sword blades uncooperative firewood inexplicable soakings and a lessthanhelpful rescuee not to mention an entire army of bluebellies Great fun from another era and a wonderful example of the silent genre,8
991,tt0017925,Buster Keaton plays the lead in this silent era masterpiece that takes its inspiration from the Great Locomotive Chase which in turn was a real event during the American Civil War in which a train was stolen by the North and sped over the lines in preparation for the coming offenseThe General has some definitive upsides working in its favour Buster Keaton is an amazingly versatile performer able to go from clownish jokester to a saddened victim of war and poor circumstances in a heartbeat The film is also really ambitious in scope Keaton performs all of his stunts most of them hairraisingly dangerous and completely unimaginable nowadays Plus very little money is spared and the film famously has some of the most expensive set pieces and stunts of the silent eraThe plot of the film is also a lot more cohesive than say in the films made by Charlie Chaplin in the same decade Chaplins films usually contain segments that have little to do with anything except the need for funny situations The General is also a comedy but with a clear clean story arcOn the other hand I didnt find the humour or the characters as captivating Theyre okay but in this regard the decades of cultural development between the film and yours truly work against the film I just didnt find the slapstick all that funnyStill The General is a great watch for all interested in early cinema or really involved physical humour,0
992,tt0017925,The General is one of the great films and treasures of the silent era Its among the best movies of the talented comedy actor Buster Keaton In this film Keaton shows the athletic ability and courage that made him one of the best of the early comedians who performed their own stunts His physical antics on and off his train The General support his title as king of comedy stunts All the silent era comedy actors seemed to have lots of energy And many had daring courage and even madness at times Those were the actors who did all or most of their own stunts While there were some stunt men around in the early s it wasnt until the last of the silent years and dawn of sound pictures that stuntmen were a regular part of the cast of films that required any amount of derringdo And while a small number of actors today will still do some of their own stunts nothing can compare to the actors of old who performed their own highrisk and dangerous stunts – and sometimes those for other actors The five best early actors at doing stunts were Buster Keaton Douglas Fairbanks Sr Harold Lloyd Tom Mix and Yakima Canutt The latter two specialized in Westerns and besides acting and doing stunt work Mix and Canutt regularly rode and performed in the rodeo circuit Lloyd was versatile in his venues but excelled at high stunts on buildings and sometimes with wild animals Fairbanks excelled in swashbuckler stunts sliding down the sails of ships swinging from anything hanging aloft and jumping with the help of trampolines into windows Keaton was even more versatile As a child actor in vaudeville Keaton learned how to fall to avoid injury He called his technique soft falls or landings But even with his training and practice his film roles with derringdo often left him bruised at the least At other times he had suffered injuries from slight to serious Still he had become known for his physical resiliency During the filming of The General in  Keaton was knocked unconscious by canon fire He suffered a broken ankle while filming the  short The Electric House And he broke his neck during the  shooting of Sherlock Jr but didnt know it until years later This movie has an interesting plot set during the US Civil War It opens with a scene and script that reads The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marietta Georgia in the spring of  The train seems to be traveling about  miles per hour But the film is almost entirely about action and the comedy in the action involving the train There is an element of romance The cast all are very good The photography is superb Much of the action with trains is filmed in Westcentral Oregon from Eugene to Cottage Grove Theres no information about sound at all so I assume the music we hear with the film is soundtrack that was added for modern viewing It probably is meant to replicate the piano accompaniment that was usual with silent films in theaters of the day This is one instance when I think the piano playing would have been better The music seems to go overboard at times This is one of the early great films from the silent era that showcase the talent and early mastery of moviemaking skills Its a fun movie with strong visuals that even a modern family of all ages should enjoy,10
993,tt0017925,Johnnie Gray a train engineer tries to enlist in the Confederate Army to impress his girlfriend Unfortunately he is rejected because his role as engineer is deemed more important Lucky for Gray he is given the opportunity to prove himself when a band of Union soldiers in disguise hijack a trainAt the time of this films release it was a flop and considered to be not very funny Since then it has gone on to be declared one of the greatest films of all time Funny how that works I would tend to agree that it isnt really very funny but it is a great film for a variety of reasonsBuster Keaton was an amazing actor and director He was willing to put himself in dangerous situations for a laugh  he was his own stuntman right there when the train falls in the water really sitting on the side of a moving train and on the front of it he could have been killed And this was captured on film flawlesslyPersonally I enjoyed his Sherlock Jr better I thought the tricks were better and the action funnier It had a faster pace too that kept me hooked enough to watch it a few times The General was not boring but as a silent film it could have done more to grab the audience and Im not sure that it did,7
994,tt0021749,If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend as others have pointed to in the past City Lights is the one Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies like Modern Times and The Gold Rush City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest his bravest his most romantic and his most sympathetic Its tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters but its pulled off The film centers on three characters the Tramp the quintessential funny homeless man who blends into the crowd but gets caught in predicaments He helps a drunken businessman Myers a fine performance in his own right from suicide and becomes his on and off again friend that is when it suits him and doesnt notice his friends state The other person in the Tramps life is the Blind Flower Girl Virginia Cherrill one of the most absorbing beautiful and key female performances in silent film who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money which leads to a how else can I put it magical boxing match where its basically a  from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull Though there is no dialog the film achieves a timelessness its essentially a tale of two loners who find each other lose each other and find each other again the last scene widely discussed by critics for decades is moving if not tearinducing And its never ever boring once you get along with the Tramp you find the little things about him the reaction shots the little things he does after the usual big gag look to the ballroom scene for examples of this or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing Truth be told if this film makes you indifferent never watch Chaplin again But if you give yourself to the film you may find its one of the most charming from the era or perhaps any era,10
995,tt0021749,Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplins City Lights a masterpiece Its only  minutes long but they are among the best  minutes you could spend at the movies and the last five minutes are simply exquisite Keep your Kleenex box at arms length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says Yes I can see now the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanationChaplin was at his zenith in  when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story and the Little Tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade He had already made the classics The Gold Rush  and The Circus  starring his character so its obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time The advent of talkies didnt stop Chaplin from making this Comedy Romance in Pantomime as he subtitled it as he knew giving the Little Tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character What I particularly enjoyed in this film is how the Little Tramp fancies himself as a wellmannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down even going to prison for love It is this selfdelusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl played in an effectively plaintive manner by Virginia Cherrill Her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable Simply compare her to the screen test shown of Georgia Hale Chaplins leading lady in The Gold Rush and an obviously more experienced actress than Cherrill as Hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the Little Tramp is the wealthy gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sightOf course this would not be a Chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes  the rising and lowering of the street elevator the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers and was according to the footage included as a DVD extra inspired by an earlier Chaplin short The Champion from  Even a simple moment for example when the Little Tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment And special mention needs to go to Chaplins musical score where he beautifully interweaves José Padillas La Violetta as his love themeThe transfer to DVD is very good and the DVD set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality The Serge Bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film and the footage of Chaplin from a Vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the longforgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then The aforementioned Georgia Hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long The minute home movie of Chaplins trip to Bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise Regardless the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies Chaplins reputation as one of the worlds leading filmmakers,10
996,tt0021749,This is my favorite Chaplin film but I dont want that to diminish his other work either MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick and even the largelyneglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone Chaplin didnt make a bad movie and Im not even sure that CL is his best exactly But it IS my favorite if only for the endingThat ending has been the subject of much comment here I think its a masterpiece in a single scene Chaplins little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living breathing human being Its a monument to understated sentimentalityTo me the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid Yes the boxing scene is great and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful but its that ending that makes us all love this movie,0
997,tt0021749,Once again Chaplin plays his famous creation the beloved Tramp The noble Little Fellow meets and falls in love with a blind flower girl She assumes he is wealthy man and offers him a flower which he attentively accepts with his last penny One night by chance he rescues a drunken millionaire from drowning The rich gentleman becomes a generous friend when drunk but doesnt recognize the tramp when sober Chaplin takes the blind girl under his wing and takes flight with the millionaires money to cure her blindness City Lights engaged a true genius in a graceful and touching performance which arouses profound feelings and joy with great simplicity of style and tragic tale Each scene was the result of hardworking detail and planning,9
998,tt0021749,Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights and the results are spectacular The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights and even though Charlies performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant City Lights is so well made that it is one of the very few movies in which the obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked Yes you can clearly see the string holding Chaplin up in the sidesplittingly funny boxing scene but who cares? That is such classic slapstick that little things like that really dont matter Besides lets keep in mind that this movie was made seventy years ago Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk His friendship with the drunken rich guy is hilarious but it also makes a significant comment about the problems of alcohol This is truly a great film which should not be forgotten,10
999,tt0021749,Charlie Chaplins City Lights contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it  Although made very much in the oldfashioned silent film tradition much of it is timeless tooAfter a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning Charlies little tramp character makes two acquaintances  He meets a blind girl selling flowers who mistakes him for a rich man and the two become very fond of each other Then he meets a real millionaire who is drunk depressed and about to commit suicide  In a comic scene the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it making himself a devoted friendThe tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight and tries to think of some way he could help  His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades  his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny and one of Chaplins best comic pieces Meanwhile when his millionaire friend is drunk he dotes on the tramp but when sober he forgets who the tramp is leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for CharlieAll of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the bestremembered scenes in any film  City Lights shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master who without words can move his audience or make them laugh  Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once,0
1000,tt0021749,Film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia  Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are  Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation  We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new  In City Lights and other silent works of film a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere  While watching the film I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story the sets the crew; the whole project  While this may not have been the complete reality it felt that way and thus made the film more enjoyable  In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional responseSince film is at its very core a visual medium I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium  I dont use the word basic here in a demeaning sense but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance  Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced but they were and are beautiful  The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic There is a warmth found in City Lights and other Chaplin films The Kid Modern Times that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today  Maybe its just that with simplicity comes honesty and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer,0
1001,tt0021749,City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of filmmaking Chaplins last silent film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the mans wealth to make her fall in love with him The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesnt recognize the tramp anymore On top of this the flower girl has to pay  dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forthThe outcome of the movie is to almost all people known It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film The movie itself still is masterpiece more than  years after its release I personally rate this as Chaplins second best I have seen so far My favorite remains The Gold Rush Still this movie gets / stars from me,9
1002,tt0021749,I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplins nicest most underappreciated silent movie gems Then I discovered it really wasnt underrated; its rated very high on most critics lists It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this onePart of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that Im a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one Its a romance between Charlies tramp character no name and a blind girl who also had no name in this film Virginia Cherill who played the blind woman and had a wholesome pretty face which I found very attractiveIm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as talkies were out in full force by  Chaplin was at his best in silent movies anyway and his comedy routines are legendary He gave me a lot of laughs in this film as always and I particularly laughed I love slapstick at the boxing scene Kudos too to Harry Myers as the eccentric millionaireTheres a lot of drama as well as humor in this minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sightComedy romance drama with suffering all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment Its hard to believe this movie was not up for one single Academy Award,9
1003,tt0021749,CITY LIGHTS United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  l is a silent comedydrama released at the height of the sound era Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad Chaplin gambled with this production and made it pay off Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH  as the one movie he would most want to be remembered CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time practically places his other silent masterpiece THE CIRCUS  to oblivion CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama but in Chaplins case pathosSubtitled A comedy romance in pantomime the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city After the unveiling the crowd finds a little tramp Charlie Chaplin sleeping on the lap of one of the figures As he tries to climb down he encounters one problem after another This opening scene alone is priceless With such a great beginning Chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot The theme to CITY LIGHTS is remembered mainly about a tramps love for a blind girl However there is a subplot involving the tramps involvement with a millionaire drunk which by far takes up more time than the sentimental love story These two segments actually set the pattern First segment set in the afternoon finds Charlie walking down the street examining a nude statue in a shop being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing He encounters a beautiful blonde girl Virginia Cherrill selling flowers After she drops one of her flowers Charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it thus realizing shes blind Smitten by her beauty he picks it up and pays her for it Minutes later the slamming of a limousine door is heard with the girl believing the kind gentleman Charlie to be a millionaire Second segment set at night finds Charlie encountering a drunk Harry Myers trying to commit suicide by drowning himself Just as Charlie is about to save him he in turn falls into the river The drunk in gratitude for saving his life takes Charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn By morning the millionaire now sober fails to recognize or remember Charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion This running gag thats repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious but Chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges By day Charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when shes not at her usual corner selling flowers Finding that shes ill and being cared by her grandmother Florence Lee whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction Charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs ranging from streetcleaning to fighting in a boxing match Reading in a newspaper of a European doctor who restores sight for the blind Charlie gives the girl $ for an operation the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire who after sober accuses Charlie of robbing him has his arrested and serving jail time The climatic finish is truly the best thing Chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missedFeatured in the supporting cast are Henry Bergman Allan Garcia Albert Austin and Hank Mann While much has been discussed about Chaplins performance his costar Virginia Cherrill as the blind girl no name given should not go without mention Even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor Cary Grant her performance is excellent by all means Although its been said that future film star Jean Harlow  appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence she is visible in a surviving still photograph but no such scene appears in the finished product Unlike THE GOLD RUSH CITY LIGHTS had limited showings in revival houses in later years and was never allowed to be distributed to television Being first introduced to CITY LIGHTS at New York Citys revival movie house The Regency Theater formerly located on Broadway and th Street in  the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience There was one man probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film No doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else Watching CITY LIGHTS surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in After Chaplins death in December of  CITY LIGHTS along with his other silent features were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure but became readily available on video cassette at the time of Chaplins th birthday  In later years CITY LIGHTS was frequently revived on various cable channels ranging from Turner Network Television TNT in the early s American Movie Classics up to  and finally Turner Classic Movies The complete musical soundtrack that accompanies CITY LIGHTS happens to be the original score composed to perfection by Chaplin himself Much has been written and said about CITY LIGHTS over the years To learn more about the making difficulties and long term preparations to CITY LIGHTS either watch Kevin Blownlows  documentary Hollywood A Celebration of the American Silent Film as narrated by James Mason or Brownlows other documentaries dedicated entirely to Chaplins career including outtakes to CITY LIGHTS as well as scenes involving Virginia Cherrills temporary replacement Georgia Hale Chaplins costar in THE GOLD RUSH ****,10
1004,tt0021749,Spoilers hereinFor me this film falls not into the category of favorite films Im a Marx brothers kind of guy but earns instead a place on a very short list of most important moviesThats because it has two features that I truly appreciateIt is as pure a vision of its creator as is possible Nearly all other films are engineered from prior work Not so with a small list of projects from Welles Kurosawa Eisenstein  and this one project of Chaplins They are wholly original springing from some nether worldBut the other element is the one that impresses the most This film is about itself about the art of visual narrative Chaplin was intelligent enough to know that what he was doing was new The issues are centered on what the audience `sees so while he struggles with what and how the audience sees he builds that into the fabric of the storyThe primary framing is about the blind girl who falls in love with him by `seeing him in her own way Then `sees him at the end in a different way The rich man recognizes the tramp when drunk but does not when he is not Nearly all the jokes indeed every element of the film is about this same dynamic the elevator which is not seen but then was the burglars the same the Tramp on the statue on the barrel Even seeing the cigar before the bum does Even us seeing the soap and the foreman notThe `seeing is carried over to `hearing with the politician and whistle jokes And then even further as Charlie turns his back on the new technology of giving us speech and instead `shows us something else he writes and conducts an amazing score instead This is truly amazing and one reason to take Mike Figgis seriouslyNo wonder Orson Welles considered this the most important film ever made But as to the best to watch? Because film is so derivative my own gold standard for the Tramp is Robert Downeys and to some extent Depps Comic timing is something that evolves and those men make a more effective Tramp for my modern ability to seeTrivia Chaplin found the `blind girl in a group of spectators at a fight and was struck with how her expressions reflected what she saw Shes pretty as well of course but certainly not the prettiest Chaplin knew See how Chaplin separately works in both the fight a performance and her reaction to his performance in the film,0
1005,tt0021749,Waddling along with his cane and derby hat and that tiny mustache the little tramp Charles Chaplin is visually unlike any character in film history The tramp is kindhearted always dignified Hes a simple soul who in City Lights tries to help out a young blind woman well played by Virginia Cherrill This is a silent film of course but the tramps body language is his speechThe really noticeable feature of the tramp character is how he blends into everyday life Hes more or less ignored by many laughed at by others The girls grandmother never sees him at all And only when the millionaire is drunk does he see the tramp as a friend Curious  and deepThe tramp gets into his fair share of trouble but only through his bumbling efforts to help the girl The boxing match is a hoot and very well choreographed as are all the skits And what a beginning for a film with city leaders spouting gibberish probably as Chaplins dig at the talkies Then the way Chaplin makes his grand entrance  just terrific!Melancholy at times the films music really tugs at your heartstrings Maybe its sentimental and manipulative But given the abiding and Zenlike qualities of the tramp some sentimentality is quite appropriate And the music is choreographed totally in sync with the plot actionProduction design is sparse and at times drab That the film was made during the Great Depression is beyond obviousComedy here is simple and effective The main character expresses heart and humanity The little tramp is an unforgettable character And City Lights is a wonderful film,10
1006,tt0021749,Chaplin was a unique presence in the history of the early cinema  Coming up through the ranks he gradually achieved a godlike stature being awarded total control of every facet of the productionNot only was he often the sole person who knew what the end product was to be as in The Kid but he was also allowed to elaborately improvise in the creative process  This often meant doing countless scores of retakes over days weeks and even months; holding up the cast and crew for days while he brooded over just what to do next; and even in the case of The Gold Rush cancelling expensive weeks of location shooting and returning to the studio to start all over againHe cleverly duped chief studio and bank chiefs into somehow going along with his freewheeling and gross inclinations thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hitandmiss schemes and trialanderror madnessIn other words Chaplin used the entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush with which he toyed at his pleasure to create his personal canvases  Fortunately he was a genius and at the right place in time to be allowed to get away with such unprecedented extravagenceIt was a young and growing industry when Chaplin began emerging and there were no set rules  People were still trying to figure out just what could be done with the medium  and Chaplin helped to establish its early parametersHe was certainly and autocrat yet that doesnt really matter when it comes to film works  Its the product that counts  In the case of City Lights all the bloodsweatandtears that it took to achieve the finished product was more than worth the effort  Now that all the frustration anger and outrage associated with the behindthescenes unfoldment of this highly troubled production are well in the past what remains is a genuinely moving film classic,10
1007,tt0021749,The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one The first fulllength talkies were released in  By  theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business By  silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism But in  a new silent picture was released that far from being an embarrassing failure became the fourthhighest grossing picture of the year being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy The picture was City Lights and its producer writer director editor composer and star was Mr Charlie ChaplinChaplin was of course primarily a comedian and his humour was of broad appeal but audiences of the time were not exactly starved of easy comedy The Marx Brothers were making great strides on the verbal quipping front and the everpopular Laurel and Hardy had made a successful transition to sound What makes Charlie stand out and what gave him a level of accessibility that allowed him to continue with his slapstick antics well into the sound era is his equal devotion to story which allowed him a scope for social commentary empathetic characterisation and deep poignancy Of all Chaplins silent pictures City Lights is probably his least memorable in the funny stakes The number of classic gags here is fairly small Not since The Kid a decade earlier has Chaplin given story so much precedence City Lights is riddled with coincidence and plot contrivance but its a tale of such beauty and sincerity that this does not matter Within this story the comedy becomes functional often serving to puncture a schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone Ironically it is the occasional forays into slapstick that help keep City Lights realAs if to snub the talkie City Lights is a remarkable achievement in complex visual narrative even only occasionally relying upon title cards and then often only as an embellishment to the more comedydriven moments Most plot points and character traits are implied rather than stated which gives the picture a continual smoothness – another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad to see the back of the intrusive title card Out of necessity Chaplins technical approach is more overt than his usual He often cuts to a closeup to give us a necessary reaction and there are even some whippans in the scene where he and the flower girl first meet but all of this is in keeping with the rhythm and tone of the picture Those whip pans after all reflect an abrupt emotional moment and are in no way a blatant or showy manoeuvreBut what really makes City Lights work what makes it connect is the man himself on the screen Those additional closeups once a rarity for a man who acted mainly with his body now show off a capability for intense facial acting An older more meditative Chaplin may have been keeping the traditions of silent cinema alive but his own career trajectory was entering new ground where emotional expression was increasingly intimate and personal The result is profoundly moving,10
1008,tt0021749,City Lights is a different film from what I am used to seeing I have not watched a Silent film or pantomime in a few years I really enjoyed the story that Charles Chaplin helped to create and produce for our enjoyment The plot seems to be commonly used now with a boy falling in love and trying to win the girls love in return In City Lights there are a few twists to the plot The girl is blind and poor the TrampChaplinis poor in love and wants to help the blind girl The Millionaire can help the tramp out by giving him money but he is an onagain offagain friend depending on whether or not he is drunkBeing that this is a silent film there is more importance on the use of props and the acting of the character Since in a silent film they cant tell us how they are feeling it is important that we can understand feelings through action This may be through facial expressions body language dress eye contact kinds of touch or the use of written statements like title cards in a silent film A prop that stood out to me was the use of flowers From the flower girl selling her flowers to how Chaplin was always holding or smelling one of the flowers from his special girl the use of flowers helped show the emotions and feelings of the two characters It symbolized the affection he had for her because like the flowers she couldnt see she couldnt see the true him or his true affections Another prop that was used was money From the millionaires point of view money was really of no matter He threw a party just because he had been reunited with his friend he went out to the dance club and when Chaplin needed money in order to help the flower girl pay for rent and surgery he was willing to give him one thousand dollars To the millionaire this money is nothing but to Chaplin and the flower girl this is a showing forth of love and charity When the movie was made in the s many people were poor and hopeless but the portrayal of Chaplin as a poor but happy and hopeful man might have given hope to others who watched this movie during the Depression In the film I noticed the use of a repetition or rather a parallelism as was read in the Film Art book dealing with The Wizard of Oz They show shots one way in Kansas and then reverse the shot in Oz as I saw in City Lights In City Lights parallelism is done with sight not necessarily with eyes but with the mind We see the reverse where the poor blind girl sees Chaplin as a millionaire and then at the end she sees him as the tramp he is with her new eyesight The true reverse is emphasized because she is now working in a shop and making money The two characters are somehow always at perceived opposite ends of the social class spectrum yet he still has a desire for her to be happy because of his love Another reverse is the happy friendly drunk millionaire who sees Chaplin as his friend and hero for stopping him from committing suicide However when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him throws him out and even has him arrestedIn a way this film is different then what our generation might be used to but by watching these classics we can better learn where the movies we love today came from and gain a better appreciation for the art of film,7
1009,tt0021749,The tramp tries to nurture and help a blind flower girl regain sight despite scant resources and the prejudices and graft of the big city Although the physical gags lack the largescale invention of the factory scenes in Modern Times and the criticism of the wealthy doesnt transcend an admittedly witty recurring jokethe aristocrat friend can only demonstrate compassion and friendliness in an inebriated state; hes always inviting the tramp in only to incredulously throw him out the next sober morningthe tramps touching earnestness in rescuing his angel from a life of abjection is simple and selfless and deeply moving I would say it also fades out at the perfect moment of openended ambiguitythe viewer is forced to make resonant meaning out of the final troublingly cathartic shot even as the film articulates a consistent worldview in relation to what has come before In my eyes Modern Times is Chaplins masterpiece but City Lights would probably better merit repeat viewings which is as much a testament to the films power as anything else,8
1010,tt0021749,City Lights is probably one of the most well loved along with Modern Times Chaplin movies The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp one of the most lovable truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps like they are labeled lazy and troublesome It is very hard to hate The Tramp because he gives so much when he has so little He spends his time and money giving to people  whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl Undoubtedly we all have a little bit of The Tramp in usThe plot is as follows the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street She is poor and by a mere coincidence believes that The Tramp is rich He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide and despite his gratefulness doesnt remember the poor tramp unless he is drunkCity Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history Its poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy I believe it is a strong mixture of both and a great balance of the two Both comedic and touching City Lights should not be missed by anyone,8
1011,tt0021749, its perhaps a test of a persons outlook to ask them what they see in the final scene If theyve never seen City Lights before and they instantly notice the major continuity issue Chaplin holds a flower to his lapel from the rear shot its up to his mouth on his close up then maybe theyve placed film studies over romanceIt took a few viewings before I spotted this and once I did I cant help but notice it Yet even despite this I never fail to get choked up on the beauty of that final scene If you want to impress the right kind of girl put it on and show her what a sensitive soul you are during those final momentsAs for the rest of the film then while the final five minutes are classic and perhaps the best thing Chaplin ever did the rest of it is episodic and patchy necessitating my relatively low score Still a fine film but never a completely great one what presages those beautiful final moments is merely fine entertainment,7
1012,tt0021749,If i have to choose which movie have the best ending it is very easy to choose city lights it is very very easy Chaplin was genius seriously genius This is the movie that truly inspire me After i watch city lights i just know there is such a movie power that exist in this world that can move and touch me really deep I never feel such a sharp sensation ever from any hundred movies i watch before and this movie pierce me through the heart within silent only gesture eye contact and cameraworks with no dialoguesometimes i try to analyze deeply why this movie have such a magnificent power i think the reason is the connection between scenes if we ask ourself what makes a good ending ? maybe the answer is how good you make the scene before the ending how good you correlate the prologue and epilogue and also between them how you fill the midduration of a movie if the director took a right decision a movie will not have any wasted scenes its only genius filmmaker can do and chaplin is one of themsilent movie such as city light is a hardkind of movie to made it needs next level of acting skill from the actors and actresses because there are no dialogue in it and most of the duration this movie is flawless in casting and the ending scene were unbelievable and unpredictable maximum genuine artbeauty of silent moviei recommend everybody to watch this movie at least once this movie is special it definitely will pierce you,10
1013,tt0021749,As always the little tramp is fleeing the long arm of the law when he is mistaken for a wealthy man by a blind girl selling flowers by the roadside While he longs to help her the tramp knows he cannot However when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon a drunken man who he helps out who may be able to help him in turn  if the two of them can sober up long enoughIn response to seeing some modern trash posing as comedies recently Little Man Norbit Pluto Nash  Im looking at you I decided to check out some comedies that have stood the test of time  a few Chaplin films being among them City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start As was often the case this film has a thin narrative but one that allows for several scenarios for Chaplin to work his magic And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole filmThe statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at His support do no more than that  support him  but yet they are also roundly good Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character while Myers Garcia Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside ChaplinCity Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent setpieces that tickle and also stick in the mind So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead,0
1014,tt0021749,Do you really need to post a spoiler warning for a movie that as of tonight is  years old?I havent read other reviews so forgive me if I repeat any previous postings City Lights is with nary a doubt the greatest love story ever told Forget Casablanca Forget An Affair to Remember Forget Love Story For the love of Christ forget Love Story This is a movie about the purest loveWe have the simple ubiquitous Tramp He is smitten with a blind flower girl who has mistaken him for a wealthy man There is a new operation that cures blindness and the Tramp will do anything to help Flower Girl regain her sight He tries to win a boxing match in which he is clearly outclassed In an era that is forgotten in modern times pun gleefully intended he cleans the streets of dung One of the best sight gags in screen history happens when the Tramp has to clean up after an elephant Finally he steals from a wealthy man to get the money he needs to pay for Flower Girls operationAnd then after he has spent many years in prison the Tramp is reunited with Flower GirlMy fellow males this is a wonderful Chick Flick If your lady friend isnt reduced to tears by the last  minutes of this movie you need to find a new lady Ive seen it a dozen times and it always gets to me,0
1015,tt0021749,Four years into sound Charlie Chaplin wrote performed directed and scored one of films finest masterpiecesThe story is about the Little Tramp befriending a blind woman who mistakenly thinks he is rich Along the way he manages to get into a series of unintentional fixes with a large cast of foils at his disposal as he struggles to finance an operation for the womanIn an incredible display of comic talent Chaplin bombards the audience with scene after scene of magnificently choreographed comedy Drunk dancing or boxing his graceful slapstick is a rare combination of comedy and beauty a comic ballet Chaplins performing artistry as well as his ideas reach their apex with City Lights where only Chaplin would dare to challenge the naturally progressive trend and technological status quo by daring to make a silent By pulling it off with aplomb he solidified his place atop the history of the profession Some sound is used sparingly brilliantly with a statue dedication and a piano keyboard but no intelligible words are uttered The track and Chaplins score is lyrical energized and integral The film is perfectly constructedIn the masterful hands of Chaplin he avoids bathos in his scenes with the blind woman by severing the sentimentality and the scene with a comic moment saving it all for the incredibly touching and moving finale Up until then it is a display of comic genius that only a handful of others might lay claim to,10
1016,tt0021749,As much as I loved The Kid The Gold Rush Modern Times and The Great Dictator City Lights is the film I consider Charlie Chaplins masterpiece And there are several reasons why this is so for meI love how City Lights is filmed once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets The music is also a delightthough my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times with plenty of themes that stuck in my head while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand The comedy is brilliantly done the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin moviealong with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator but ever in a comedy while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girlplayed touchingly by Virginia Cherrill he falls in love with And I also found the closeup climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity Chaplin is superb his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with CherrillOverall yet another Chaplin masterpiece yet for me this is the best of them all / Bethany Cox,10
1017,tt0021749,Charlie Chaplin made some extremely funny shorts but of his longer films this is one of the best along with The Gold Rush and Modern Times Two stories are woven together One is Charlies onagain offagain friendship with a wealthy drunk The guy has a case of multiple personality When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts When hes sober he doesnt recognize Charlie at allThe second story involves a pretty blind flower girl who given certain distances angles and lighting resembles Uma Thurman Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballsCharlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy hes sober and wont support Charlies story Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel broke and bitter he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands The happy endingTheres sentimentality in the story of course There often is in Chaplins later films But as usual its somehow tempered Here its undercut by ironyWhen Charlie meets the wealthy toff the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope Hes about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes gives him a pep talk and changes his mind His spirit revived the rich guy spread his arms to the sky dropping the boulder that falls on Charlies footAnd when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl shes enthralled by his gentleness Unseen by her the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain himself enraptured Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlies face Well its not the blind Mr Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W C Fields general store but what is? A note There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film not counting the DempseyTunney debacle but I dont think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed hereIts hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this Black and white and silent Applause please,8
1018,tt0021749,City Lights  **** out of Charlie Chaplin returns as The Tramp and this time he falls in love with a blind girl Virginia Cherrill and sets out to help her The Tramp eventually meets a suicidal drunk Harry Myers and their friendship leads to what might eventually help the girl he lovesChaplin made great films before and after CITY LIGHTS but for my money this here is his greatest film as well as one of the greatest films ever made Not only is it one of the funniest movies ever made but Id also argue that its one of the greatest love stories if not the greatest It really says a lot when a movie can conqueror two genres at one time but CITY LIGHTS is simply one of the greatest movies ever madeI think it says a lot that you get one classic scene after another and theres really not a weak spot to be found here Being  it took some real guts for Chaplin to deliver a silent film and I think he knew that he had to deliver something special because people had moved onto sound He certainly delivered something special as this here was easily the funniest film he had made up to this point The opening sequence with the introduction of The Tramp was priceless and we got one hilarious scene after another from that point The scenes with the drunk are downright hilarious as is another scene where The Tramp is trying to eat but without much success The cigar sequence is a masterpiece as is the by the water In fact the story between The Tramp and the drunk would have made a terrific movie on its own Just like the stuff with The Tramp and the blind girl would have made a perfect film Whats so special is that you get both stories wrapped up in one and it really deliversChaplin played The Tramp countless times but he was never better than he is here Just check out the timing in countless scenes including the boxing match and you cant help but be impressed with the actor Myers also deserves a lot of credit as the drunk as his timing has to match that of Chaplin throughout and the two men do a wonderful job together Then youve got Cherrill who wasnt a professional actor but the director makes her shine throughoutCITY LIGHTS contains one great scene after another and all of the laughs lead up to one of the most powerful endings in film history Theres really not enough great things that can be said about this film as it continues to get better with each passing year,0
1019,tt0022100,Fritz Langs highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement and ended in the United States in  with the production of The Big Heat a film noir classic Perhaps his greatest film M Germany  forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones Even though M was Langs and Germanys first sound film many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late s While most early talkies return films to their static visually monotonous stage imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium M avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous offscreen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue The films editing particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling Of course many of the films sound effects are also imaginative and memorable none more so than the compulsive whistling of the films central character the stalker and serial killer of little girls Hans Beckert magnificently played by Peter Lorre Sound is also an important contributor to Ms rich and influential use of off screen space One famous example is the scene that introduces Beckert as a shadow against his own Wanted poster creepily intoning to his next victim Elsie Beckmann You have a very pretty ball Not only is Beckerts shadow a bow toward Langs expressionist artistic roots but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image  that is among us the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuousappearing albeit monstrous member Another example of Langs use of offscreen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is Elsies absence from them an empty chair at the Beckmann dinner table the vertiginous stairwell down which Elsies mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughters arrival the attic play area that awaits Elsies return from school Most memorable of all  and most often alluded to visually in other films  is the series of shots that indirectly record Beckerts assault and murder of the innocent child representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of Elsies ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame Never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated imagesBeyond its technical brilliance the keys to Ms lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of Hans Beckerts twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and trial Unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer Beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath Nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clearcut To be sure the gutreaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry capture Beckert and bring him to a mock formal trial whose conclusion is foregone Like many in America today Beckerts accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the monster in the surest way possible a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible Considering the heinousness of Beckerts crimes and the imperfections of a legal/medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again this emotional response is hard to resist Yet M is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism  quite the contrary Through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of Beckerts unkempt court appointed defense attorney and Beckerts own impassioned monologue Lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others guilty or not in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding Nazism in s Germany That the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks dresses and gestures like a Gestapo officer is no accident Moreover the letter M chalked on Beckerts back by one of his pursuers not only stands for murderer but also alludes to Gods marking of Cain While the popular misconception holds that the mark of Cain symbolizes his evil it in fact represents Gods warning to Cains flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance but to leave justice in Gods hands Translated into secular terms and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame Gods hands in M belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try Hans Beckert in the name of the Law,10
1020,tt0022100,M /  **** 	M is a cinematic masterpiece of visual drama The stunning performances define the careers of exceptional actors such as Peter Lorre and Gustaf Grundgens Director Fritz Lang gives depth and dimension to his production by distinctly capturing the ecstasy of the films many characters and focusing accurately on individual situations This is an intriguing journey into the mind of a psychotic child murderer blending terror complexity and malignity in one amazing motion picture	Screenwriters Paul Falkenburg and Adlof Jansen construct the characters of M with distinctive personalities and three dimensional emotions Many lesser filmmakers give their characters no creativity outside the confines of the script In this movie each individual character has a mind of their own; they are free to roam the landscape of a inviting atmosphere	Fabricating such an impressive atmosphere is some of the best cinematography and lighting effects that I can remember watching This resplendent component creates the films terrific moody ambiance Suspense is one thing M contains in full context The movies third act is sheer peakhigh tension	Shot in black and white M stars Peter Lorre as PeterHans Beckert an extremely disturbed child murderer in the process of wreaking havoc on a neighborhood Parents everywhere are living in fear of their children being kidnapped and abruptly annihilated 	This picture contains a brilliantly crafted setup The visual setting creates a strongly developed opening Every scene works to either complicate the initial problem or propels the story through a firm narrative through line	The film captures the chaos of the town in terror perfectly M is more about the results of a serial killer than an actual serial killer Never do we directly witness a murder; the violent encounters are implied This method of film making perhaps makes the movies impact even greater With an creative perspective through a third person point of view the filmmakers repeatedly give us examples of a solid structure through characters and occurrences 	M offers a unforgettable challenging performance by Peter Lorre This extraordinary actor is tormenting and disturbing without embracing in extreme violent conduct He perspires with momentum and rapture This productions closing scenes are so deeply penetrating they entirely captivate the viewer Isnt this what movies are supposed to do?,10
1021,tt0022100,M is a monumental film and seriously should be watched by all For a film like this to be made in  is just shocking Even if the film was released today it would still be nothing like we have seen before In our modern age of film making there has been a considerable rise in the production of films about serial killers their complexities and particularly about pathological ones Yet M is the first movie that comes to my mind when I think of the themes that have been in Psycho Silence of the Lambs Seven and not to mention countless moreThe film is lead by Peter Lorre in a transcending performance who plays the serial killer and rapist in which the film is centered around In this performance Lorre is successful in something that at the very least is rare to see in any kind of film compassion for a child killer and rapist Lorre makes the viewer see that he is not a criminal by choice but by a sickness of compulsion Too often then not is our perception of a psychotic killer having that look that puts fear into his or hers victims eyes Lorre doesnt do that but rather displays a frightened man a scared man One in which his desperation leads to his hazardous behavior His portrayal of a killer is not of a fearless one but of one consumed by fear Something that even today we as a people cannot understand let alone in The direction and writing of Fritz Lang is beyond comprehensible as he taps into the mind of a serial killer and his complexities He does so in such that we get an empathetic and compassionate illustration of all sides of the story This in which by then end of the film all points of view are more then well delivered to the audience Fritz Lang here has simply created here a timeless masterpiece One that excels in its technical aspects and enlightens the audience on a topic that other films still have not yet to match M inI highly recommend this film for many obvious reasons and conclusions This film was created by one of the all time great directors in Fritz Lang Langs command for the screen is mesmerizing and a joy to witness and so on and so forth Yet much of this is mostly superficial and a waste of time to continuously state M as I mentioned before takes a strong and original stance on an issue that we as a society yet have not fully resolved This film may not give you THE answer on this issue but it may sway that moral compass of yours that lies inside of all of us,10
1022,tt0022100,The economy austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound and precise filmmakers Lang a master of the German expressionist film shot his first talkie a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies It was a shocking idea for its time based on the reallife killer Peter Kurten headlined as the Vampire of DüsseldorfM is about a terrorized city and a plump little man with wide eyes often chewing candy who is a pathological childkiller unable to control his urge for killing The film embodies several Lang themes the duality between justice and revenge mob hysteria the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in and for probably the first time in the cinema it adds a new dimension to suspense pity For the killer is clearly mentally sick He cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease and yet we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal rather than treated as a sick man Early in the film the killer is heard whistling the Grieg theme from In the Hall of the Mountain King This theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace And when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window the melody on the soundtrack told us chillingly that the murderer is there just out of sightThe Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since Casablanca The Maltese Falcon and The Mask of Dimitrios When the photographs of his victims all little girls are shown to him he jumps back and twitches with horrorWith powerful visuals Langs motion picture is Lorres first film His performance as the corpulent hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion Lorre is the archetypal outsideroutside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal He had only twelve lines of dialogIn the most famous of all about a pathological killer  Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho  Anthony Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy Psycho reeked with blood and horror whereas the suspense of M is subtle A childs balloon without an owner a rolling ball are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed The audience trapped in its seats torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight,8
1023,tt0022100,The first time I saw M by Fritz Lang I almost didnt know what to make of it I was overwhelmed by the power of the performances the staging of the scenes the locations and the power that the simple story had with such complex circumstances Then I saw it again and a third time and I know that this is one of the best films ever to come out of Germany its a powerful statement about protecting our children if youre looking at it as a message movie but in reality it is just a piece of cinema heaven Thrillers today only wish they could draw a viewer into the mystery elements and have such unconventionality of the times Boiling down to this M is about a child Killer  the legendary character actor Peter Lorre in his first major role  who snatches children when their parents dont watch and continues on until an investigation goes underway But as the police investigate overly thoroughly into the real criminal underworld they know something is up that this is someone far more gone than they could ever be so they join in the hunt This all leads to one of the supreme dramatic climaxes in any thrillerOn the first viewing I just went straight for the story which is able to suck one in enough to make you feel dizzy But on the multiple viewings it becomes even more interesting as one can study the intricacy and indeed fullon artistry of Langs camera He puts it in unusual places at times and adds for good measure shades of dark and gray in many of the night scene this is by the way a precursor to filmnoir which Lang later became an important director in the s and s On top of this there is a very modern sense of style in the editing I remember a couple of scenes that surprised me editing wise One is where the cops I think it was the cops have an argument about the investigation two of them get into a shouting match and we get medium closeups of them going back and forth This is done quickly with a kind of intensity that isnt even captured in todays thrillers There is also the hunt for Lorre in the digging of the house where Lang cuts around constantly heightening the tension between the predators the criminals and the prey Lorre until its almost too much to takeThe disturbing aspects of the story of child abduction and murder have become benchmarks of a number of todays thrillers where the cop is usually the subject and the killer left more in the shadows in cat &amp; mouse style This doesnt happen here and because of it by the time we get to the final scene with Lorre being interrogated and giving his I cant help it speech it becomes something poetic tragic frightening Lang doesnt leave his message so simplistically he makes sure we know Lorres side too however twisted it has become and the antagonist is shown as human as opposed to these presentday thriller where the killers are barely given one dimension let alone two There were reports that during filming Lang put Lorre through torture ultimately causing the two to never work together again But nevertheless out of this comes a towering performance of a small wildeyed criminal in the midst of an extremely welltold and unpredictable mystery story In short if you dont know what youre in for when you hear that whistle those several infamous notes you may not at all,10
1024,tt0022100,The opening scene of this movie is the first clue to its near perfection  A mother preparing dinner for her child waiting anxiously for her to return from school  Her hope and then distress as she hears people pass outside her door  While down in the streets of Berlin her daughter is receiving a balloon from a strange man in a long black coat  We know whats going to happen but its still horrific to watchFritz Lang you cinematic god!  A simple story of the underworld the police and a single man holding an entire city hostage and done with such precision and prenoir darkness that is oozes creepy suspense from beginning to endBut this movie is not so simple as the police inspectors trying to catch a devious murderer  its about the mob employing its network of beggars and petty thieves also trying to bring the killer to their own brand of justice Apparently the police crackdown caused by the murders is bad for business  so the mob begins to track him down as wellIts not only a great crime story and perhaps the first physiological thriller the murderer is schizophrenic but theres comments to be made here about the nature of justice and who should best dispense itIn all not only a trailblazing classic but THE trailblazing classic,10
1025,tt0022100,This is a very interesting film on so many levels Its interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture  Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place  what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding Compare it with any American film from  and you cant help but see the differenceThe murderer artfully played by Peter Lorre has been killing children that have no link to him personally for months The police despite all of their efforts are unable to catch him mainly because there is no rhyme or reason in his choice of victims At first there is a focus on the victims and the hole left in their families by their killing Then the film shifts to two normally opposed groups  the police and the underworld After several months of no results by the authorities the police are unhappy because it reflects badly upon them and the underworld is unhappy because their activities are being disrupted because of the police doing constant raids in their efforts to capture the killerIn a particularly welldone part of the film the scene shifts back and forth between a conference of police and one of the underworld They discuss how they are going to catch the killer The police settle upon the idea of looking for people with a history of past mental problems that were pronounced cured and released The underworld decides to enlist an invisible group  the beggars  to follow every child at all times and therefore catch the killer Both groups focus on the right suspect the question is  who gets there first? M is a fascinating film that raises many topics  the death penalty a group of criminals that are criminals by choice causing less stress on society than a lone criminal that acts out of an uncontrollable compulsion and the motivations of the authorities often being their own bureaucratic survival rather than the larger issue of ending a series of horrible acts against humanity,9
1026,tt0022100,Being a huge fan of German Expressionist art Im naturally drawn to the films of Fritz Lang  I recently was able to see the restored version of Metropolis on the big screen and was delighted to see M on the Sundance channel  especially since it was the uncut version  M follows the trail of a child killer Peter Lorre sought both by the police and the members of the underworld whose businesses are being effected by the investigation ,8
1027,tt0022100,This movie is definitely one of the scariest movies Ive ever seen Its about this childlike pity evoking man brilliantly played by Peter Lorre who also happens to be a psychotic child killer The city in which he lives is of course panicked by the mysterious childkillings and both the criminals and the police starts to haunt the man down I wont reveal more then this but I will say this Just because its an old movie dont let your guard down This movie is one of those rare movies which are so good that youll never forget them,10
1028,tt0022100,In an eerie propagandist fashion the phrase in the name of the Law is repeated over the last two scenes of Fritz Langs M as a child killer is brought to justice If L represents the State and the Law then M is meant to represent the Individual who in this case is a Murderer Lang boldly asked us way back in  whose rights come first the State or the Individual? A master of his craft Lang leaves the question openended and lets the audience decideM is shockingly contemporary in its psychological complexities It explores the psychology of individualism vs group think while showcasing how a state of fear can be inflicted upon a populace when a government fails to protect society from a single individual terrorizing the people The story is fairly straightforward An elusive citizen begins killing innocent children in a large nameless German city The media fuels a paranoid frenzy that incites the public The clueless police begin to raid the underworld after the populace is turned into a raving mob because of the failure to capture the killer The underworld comes to a screeching halt as their business is ruined by the police and starts their own manhunt for the killerUnlike a modern period piece that attempts to evoke a certain place and time M WAS a certain place and time Lang in an almost prophetic sense captured the state of mind of the German people in  as the Weimar Republic was on the brink of collapse and the Nazi Regime was preparing to take over When individuals live in a state of fear as they do in M society collapses and the Individual is crushed Only the State it seems can bring orderM is a also a masterpiece for its technical aspects The way in which Lang uses his camera to move through windows capture shadows reflections empty spaces and shift pointsofview is staggering even by todays standards He also played with the new technology of recorded sound with extensive voiceover narration and dialogue used to overlap and transition between scenes Didnt critics recently praise Michael Clayton for utilizing just such a technique as if it was something revolutionary? One can also see a protean style the would eventually birth the Film Noir movement with the creation of tension and suspense in the use of shadows and camera anglesYet M is not perfect It has some major flaws There are no real characters in the film to speak of in the modern sense The film is virtually all built around mood and plot The only time Lang invites us to emotionally connect is in the opening and closing scenes with a mother of one of the victims and in the classic scene of Peter Lorre giving his writhing and primal I cant help it! speech in front of the kangaroo court of criminals The mothers grief and Lorres madness are presented so sparsely and in such a raw form that it becomes too painful to want to connect with them Another flaw that is often overstated about films from this time period is the slow pace of the early police procedural scenes These inherent flaws combined with the inherent brilliance of Langs vision make M one of the most challenging films a modern viewer could ever sit throughWhat impressed me most about M was the subtlety of the symbolism Lang created with his haunting images As harrowing as the story is none of the gruesomeness is shown on screen Its all transmitted to the viewer through the power of suggestion Is it any wonder Hitler wanted Fritz Lang for his propaganda machine which thankfully led to Lang fleeing to America? Ill never forget the wide shots of the kangaroo court and the looks on those peoples faces as the killer is brought down the steps for trial or the vast expanse of that empty warehouse The scene of the ball rolling in the grass with no one to catch it the balloon caught in the telephone wires and the empty domestic spaces the mother has to inhabit after her child has been murdered are the types of scenes that tape into Jungian archetypes and shared fears The look on Lorres face as he confesses the hand of the Law coming down to save Lorre from being lynched and the ghastly plea from the mother in the final scene will stick with me for the rest of my life M is a communal nightmare; one that from which we have yet to awake,10
1029,tt0022100,This is one of those movies that will stay with you for the rest of your life  The characters are ugly and disturbing there is nothing cute in this movieThere are constant parallelisms drawn between the police and the underworld and the common way in which they operateWe also get to journey into the mind of the madman  If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs you should see this alsoOf course you must be patient enough to deal with subtitles and the fact that this is a very old movie  one of the first talkies  But most viewers will get something out of the dialogue even without knowing the German language,10

1031,tt0022100,This movie is so intense and enthralling it doesnt have to hide from even the most amazing Actionmovies But unlike the most actionmovies it really has a story to tell with a very interesting conclusion at the endWhen people talk about Fritz Lang they always talk about Metropolis but I think this is his masterpiece This movie MUST HAVE inspired pretty much every police movie or show ever made Rarely have I rated a movie a  with more confidence than this oneEND OF REVIEW so I dont have anymore lines but they make me write  lines apparently so Im writing this I know a joke ehm well its not a good one so I will quote GEORGE BESTI spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars The rest I just squandered,10
1032,tt0022100,Watching Fritz Langs M is watching the history of cinema unfold before ones eyes Made in the transition period between the silent and sound film this  masterpiece remains fascinating for several reasonsFirst of all the use of sound is impeccable Suffice to say the killer in the movie is caught is through identifying his trademark whistling But the use of voiceover narration was also new at the time and is used here very well first when a mother calls in panic for her missing child and her name echoes across several empty walls Next in a scene in which two detectives elaborate on what theyve done to apprehend the killer and everything they say is matched by an imageSecondly few times has a serial killer been treated with such complexity compassion and straightforwardness in cinema Peter Lorre plays a child murder a man who acts by impulse possibly a schizophrenic He simultaneously evokes horror and pity and hes too distant from the supercool and erudite serial killers of today Lorre plays one Hans Beckert a lonely man with a history of mental illness an ordinary man without any qualities or amazing traitsThirdly its a powerful meditation on vigilantism and crime The police is unable to capture the killer so Berlins underground decides to capture the criminal The police raids are putting them out of business and they resent the fact that a child killer is being sought amidst their ranks The absurdity of bank robbers and card cheaters with a sense of morals is not lost on the filmmakers In a mocktrial at the end these same criminals think they have the authority to sentence the child murder to death But as he tells them if they wanted if they got jobs and worked honestly they could leave their lives of crime; a man whos ordered by voices to kill cant just turn off him impulsesBut above all M is a fascinating exciting thriller Its an intelligent crime story that shows police and criminals working on different sides and with different means to achieve the same purpose If one can laugh at the idea of a criminal union realism should never be a criterion for judging art one cant laugh at the policemen in this movie Inspector Lohmann played by Otto Wernicke is one of most intelligent detectives ever to grace cinema Hes fat hes cranky hes an unlikely hero but hes shrewd he can read a persons personality at a glance hes patient Lang must have liked him too because he used the character and actor in his following crime epic The Testament of Dr Mabuse in which Lohmann shows even greater skillsI knew or at least highly expected that M would be an amazing movie But I didnt imagine a yearold movie would hold up so well in terms of cinematography sound pacing acting structure Few movies achieve such a synthesis of qualities There is no doubt on my mind that M deserves the recognition it continues to receive from film historians,10
1033,tt0022100,In my opinion this is just an OK film Except for some little stylistic tricks there is nothing special The story is OK how it is told is rather weak in some parts its even ridiculous the acting is mostly very weak except for Lorre who you dont see much of anyway and the sound quality is horrible something you cant blame it for but I had to use HEADPHONES on full volume to even understand the words! but switching from sound to silent all the time is very distracting and has no dramatic effect at all even if some say so  the opposite is the case it seems very amateurish The slow pacing is typical for its time And suspense? I dont think so In my opinion the main reasons why this film is so critically acclaimed areA Lorres overacting Whenever overacting has a purpose its critically acclaimed And his acting as a madman is very effective B Id call it heavy look The topic seems heavy and the plot and style seem all too heavy and important You almost want the film to be successful so you search for it in Lorres acting As a justification so to say Im sure you like the film for many other reasons too Some more important reasons maybe But that doesnt mean Im wrong Its a film we want to like and where you dont want to look for the flaws Well long story short I dont think the final result is a success There is too much Average in it and the Great isnt all that great Metropolis Nosferatu Caligari Sunrise I think have all a more stunning look All silent and all made before M Dont get me wrong the cinematography is good and also inventive in little parts but not THAT revolutionary that it deserves the reputation it has Probably the flaws are too big for me to fully appreciate the rest Like every time one said He doesnt leave any marksblah blah I had to laugh He talks with the kids in the middle of the day in the middle of the street he walks along the streets with them he goes into shops buys stuff for them he makes mad gestures in public And then he also whistles this damn song all the time so loud you hear it from three streets away while everyone in the audience knows from beginning on that this will be his doom /,6
1034,tt0022100,While many of the problems of early sound pictures lampooned in Singin in the Rain were more or less myths the early talkies did present a big challenge for filmmakers everywhere Europe however was at an advantage over Hollywood because even though it took them a few years to gain the same access to sound technology films from the US would be screened abroad only six months or so after their first domestic release Thus directors like Fritz Lang were able to witness Hollywoods first faltering steps with sound before giving it a go themselvesIts funny how sceptics dismissed sound as a gimmick because the best early uses of sound were those that treated it as exactly that – a gimmick Lang demonstrates in M that a talkie need not be an entirely new kind of motion picture; sound is merely another layer of technique Rather than getting bogged down in lengthy dialogue scenes Lang keeps his storytelling primarily visual and when he needs lots of expository dialogue he intercuts multiple scenes to keep the pace going This is not to say Lang is trying to ignore sound – in fact he uses it to enhance the picture sometimes having dialogue or other noises take place offscreen to focus us on reactions or causeandeffect Other times he ironically uses completely silence something of course you never get with silent pictures due to the continuous musical score giving a dreadful sense of eerinessAnd thankfully the best elements of Langs method have survived the talkie revolution His visual style is particularly effective here in provoking a chilling disturbing atmosphere Shot compositions with large blank areas give a sense of surreal starkness Characters often stare intensely straight at the camera aggressively drawing the audience into the films world Several times we are even dumped straight into the pointofview of the killer himself The fragmented narrative with its lack of lead characters and impersonal pointbypoint plotting could easily be boring but Lang holds our interest by keeping a dynamic sense of rhythm and telling the bulk of the tale through pure wordless imagery Langs German pictures in common with typical German cinema of the time feature highly melodramatic acting and exaggerated almost comical characters These figures generally suited the fantasies and comicbook stories of Langs silent days but Im not sure they sit so well with the closetohome setting of M Still these characters are somewhat more effective now that they have voices probably because most German screen actors of the day were from a stage background Peter Lorre was a shameless ham but thats what you need to play a psychopath and in any case hes a lot better here than in many of his Hollywood roles Otto Wernicke is also incredibly entertaining in the role of Inspector Karl Fatty Lohmann; again a stagy exaggeration but with some absolutely wonderful gestures and comic timingThere isnt a lot else I can say about M – it is one of those pictures that has been analysed to death – although I doubt any comment other than mine mentions Singin in the Rain in the opening line  While not quite Langs best picture I can think of few directors who made such a smooth transition from silents to talkies and sadly this was his penultimate German picture before the Nazis took over Theres no denying that Lang was wasted in Hollywood He did his best to understand it but by and large it never understood him I say by and large; the renowned Irving Thalberg was reportedly bowled over by M and screened it to many of his writers and directors as inspirational material Had that prestigious and influential producer not died in  the same year Lang began working in Hollywood would things have turned out differently I wonder?,9
1035,tt0022100,Masterpiece is the word most film buffs and historians probably would use to describe this  Fritz Lange film based loosely on the events of a reallife serial killer a few years prior to the film In this movie the killer is Hans Beckert Peter Lorre who lures children to their deathsThough the story is about a child killer the theme of M centers more on societys obsession with the murders From kids playing games to adults going about their everyday lives everyone is on guard suspicious combative and very vindictive For selfish reasons even the petty criminal underworld wants the child killer caught But the police are ineffective and a selfrighteous mob mentality takes over The whole film is really a study in the terrifying psychology of group thinkAs it turns out the killer is less monstrous than pathetic and compulsive Beckert cant help himself Hes a short squatty bugeyed little man who cant control the devil within Lorre was perfect for the role and his acting is flawless and mesmerizing Yes the killings all offscreen are awful But the militant lynchmob mentality is just as scary Beckert is the only individualist in the filmPart silent film and part talkie the B&amp;W visual style of M is wonderfully expressionistic and baroque There are lots of overhead camera shots Background sounds like honking horns and whistles are precursors of major plot pointsWhat strikes me most about this film is its tone I can think of very few films that are so harsh so bitter so malicious so punitive M contains not an ounce of humanism Langs exwife Thea von Harbou a Nazi sympathizer wrote the film just before the rise of Hitler The films angry militant tone thus foreshadows Hitlers Third Reich from  until  Lang himself fled Germany and ended up in the USYour own personal preferences in films will determine whether you consider M to be a masterpiece or overrated or perhaps somewhere in between But individual preferences aside there can be no doubt that M is an important film historically Every person who wishes to be versed in classic films needs to see M at least once,0
1036,tt0022100,A serial killer who favors children Peter Lorre is on the loose in Berlin He is wanted by the police But even worse for him he is wanted by the Berlin underworld who have been targeted falsely by the police for being involved Watch out child killer! There is nothing bad I can say about this film The acting the directing the sound all perfect Many have praised Lang for his use of sound at a time when the practice was just coming into play And rightfully so Whereas other films have sound matching what is on the screen Lang realized he could use the effect to signify what he was not showing including the murderer who has a distinctive whistle Brilliant Not to mention that one key role is a blind beggar a man who cannot appreciate visuals but only sounds he is appropriately the man who can identify the killer! Basing the story loosely off of childmurderers of the day Grossman Haarman and Peter Kürten this is one of the darkest tales set to film up to this point There is no blood and no children are actually seen killed And the killer is relatively reserved compared to his reallife counterparts who were also rapists and cannibals He presents an interesting defense his crimes are less wrong than the crimes of others because he cannot psychologically control himself Or in modern terms not guilty by reason of mental defect Is a child killer less evil than a pickpocket? Is he in some way also a victim?I enjoyed the idea of a unionized underworld I do not know the reality of this as it seemed sort of comic and anticipated such villainous teamups as we might see in comic books But crime was certainly not unheard of and even black market meat existed and I am not sure if I really want to know what that meansMany including reviewer Stanley Kauffmann have noticed the similarity between M and Bertolt Brechts Threepenny Opera Sadly I have not seen Brechts work and cannot comment on the comparison German philosopher Theodor Lessing best known for his work on Jewish selfhatred may even have been an inspiration due to his work on Haarmann But regardless of inspiration Lang is the master here his work stands the test of time and today almost a century later is widely recognized as one of the greatest achievements on film At the least many consider it the alltime greatest German film And rightfully soThere are so many great shots including the socalled inventory shot of the criminal underworlds wares Lang also excelled with the camera angles using knives as frames and getting more than one great mirror shot I should also give credit to cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner who previously worked on Nosferatu and many others  his reputation should be second only to Karl FreundThere is nothing that beats the Criterion release with commentary short films and more I watched the film this way on DVD Perhaps a Bluray release has even more but I would not even know what could be added This disc is packed and a mustown for any film historian or Lang fan,10
1037,tt0022100,Outstanding German expressionist film from Fritz Lang that follows first the police then the underworld as they search for a child killer in Berlin The cinematography is moody and dramatic as the story moves through the poorer sections of the great city and the acting while of a more melodramatic style than is currently popular is very good* Peter Lorre is outstanding as the killer who taunts the police as the noose slowly tightens around him To some extent the film is an early procedural drama as the police use then modern forensic techniques such as finger printing and graphology to try and find the killer Tired of the increased police surveillance the citys criminal element begins their own search mobilising the numerous beggars to be eyes on the street The film touches on a number of issues that are as relevant now as in the s including mob mentality men are accused of being the killer simply for talking to a child rights of the accused the end justifies the means use of torture and the ever thorny issue of mental health and culpability One of the great preWWII German films *I watched a subtitled version on TCM,10
1038,tt0022100,M like Manichean? What can you say of a plot driven by criminals and where good people are rather inefficient for the most part and where the most despicable character earns our own sympathy This is a movie using such stark blackandwhite contrasts noir in its soul and gray in its coreM like Mob Mentality? Fritz Lang personal Jaccuse against a system where accusers arent all innocentM like Maturity? The film also consecrates German Expressionism as a peak of creativity and social relevance a sequence in history where Berlin became literally the best area and arena of expression to an art that had reached its maturityOr M like Mörder murderer in German Maudit in French doomed and Masterpiece in the universal language of cinemaM like Menace and MusicChildren are singing an elimination game of ominous undertones later we see little Elsie playing with the balloon a shadowy silhouette appears the face remains unrevealed while we hear the whistling of In the Hall of Mountain King Before the shark theme in Jaws to the Psycho shrieking violins the Peer Gynt tune became the first notable leitmotif meant to suggest an evil presence the perfect device to put us in the victims standpoint for the first act as powerlessly as the poor mother calling Elsie while her balloon the bait used by Hans Beckert is drifting along the telephone wiresThe effects are then shown through the growing fame of the new Jack the Ripper figure the ensuing paranoia with any adult basically talking to a child is assaulted The killer is a menace to an already crisisstricken society forcing the police department to triple the efforts psychiatric cases are explored handwriting analyzed and daily and nightly raids operated to make further pressure on the criminal worldM for Methodic For its second act M is the seminal police proceduralWhile covering that angle with a documentarylike precision Lang still seems dubious about the polices efficiency and provides an interesting twist by paralleling the work of the law with the outlaws In a long sequence where both sides brainstorm about the methods to use to find him we swing back and forth from one world to another and the only indicator of the side of the law were put in is the presence of uniform last time I saw criminals acting like politicians in a masterpiece it was in The Godfather One even points out insightfully that the killer must be a bourgeois because its the very standard of life that provides the level of idleness driving any easily corruptible mind to the most extreme cornersM like the sign on the shoulderSo in a famous sequence criminals helped by the street beggars find Hans Beckert quicker than the police force he was betrayed by his trademark whistling and irony a little girl who noticed the infamous letter marked on his shoulder The following chase takes maybe too much time for the films own good Not saying the film could do without the struggle to catch him but the court is such a high point of cinemas history that the previous part seems more forgettableAnd Peter Lorre with his round face innocent eyes when hes cornered like a rat and utters his memorable speech gives the performance of a lifetime as a living symptom a man incarnating the sickness of a society where bad people toy with justice and the worst of all acts as childishly as his victims claiming innocence with such rabid eloquence hes almost convincingBeckert says he cant control his impulses a little voice urges him to commit the irreparable acts and his body language is simply gutwrenching when he simply cant put words His lawyer makes a good point about the past of some accusers whose Becket call hypocrites because they could choose to be honest but the accusers retort that whether hes responsible or not hes still a menace Sure whether their reasons are selfish or ethical is debatable but can we empathize with Beckert?M like ModernityLooking at Twitter or Youtube or Facebook comments today you can tell theres something ferocious and still ongoing about mob mentality and a film like M could be deemed as feeble and liberal in the way it provides a tribune to a child molester the worst possible crimeM like MultilayeredYet there are some powerful truths hiding underneath the thriller the truth about a society sick of its own contradictions determined to impose standards of morality white and condemning true crimes black but indulgent toward activities that have no worse repercussion That the film ends with blackclad mothers admitting their own responsibility is perhaps the most optimistic thing about M the sentence doesnt matter what matters is the lesson behind but did German learn the lesson?Ironically one could have seen the rise of the Nazi empire as the antidote like Thea Von Sarbou who wrote the film and worked for the Nazi regime other could also see it as its worst possible consecration like director Fritz Lang That he didnt side with the criminals at the end emphasizes an intuitive comprehension of his world and allowed this film to be hailed as a true intelligent nightmarish and alas premonitory masterpiece with M as the mark of a disillusioned geniusM like Meditative? Mysterious? Mantic?Interestingly the French title is M le Maudit meaning the doomed one as if Beckert was the living incarnation of a doomed society as if there was indeed something rotten in the Weimar Republic and It wouldnt get any better after but could Fritz Lang anticipate it? Looking up his second masterpiece M I was wondering whether Lang reflected his own rejection of German society or cared enough to warn the audience against the impending doom of decadenceSurely the director behind Metropolis could only pinpoint with the accuracy of a soothsayer the limits of a civilization that might take its heritage for granted,9
1039,tt0022100,This movie has it all! This is one of my alltime favorite movies Many people have criticized it because its from  and I say Who cares when you have such a great movie? Peter Lorre gives a  star performance as the child murderer and may I say he is very very haunting Fritz Langs direction is superb; the cinematography is superb! The kangaroo court scene at the end is my favorite part and its brilliantly done The plot is very well crafted Even more amazing is the plot focuses around catching the murderer but it is not boring for one second Each scene flows beautifully into the next with some amazing chases raids and facial expressions This is also a movie ahead of its time This is definitely one of the alltime best movies!,10
1040,tt0022100,Fritz Langs second absolute landmark after the equally brilliant but completely different Metropolis and also his first opportunity to work with the wonders of sound And boy did he ever deliver a great piece of work! Like the M for murderer is marked on Peter Lorres coat the film M for masterpiece is branded on cinema history annals for all eternity Langs film is a triumph in every possible viewpoint and it covers a lot more genres and elements than just simply the manhunt for a childmolester*** SPOILERS ****The horrors M handles about is timeless and of all cultures but yet itll always remain a taboo subject and for that reason alone Fritz Lang deserves extra praising In an utterly astonishing way Peter Lorre portrays Hans Beckert a child murderer who singlehandedly terrorizes four and half million people simply by his uncontrollable urge to kidnap and molest young schoolgirls The grim and haunting atmosphere is terrifically built up by images of previous Beckertvictims and the disappearance a new unfortunate girl Her toy rolling of a remote hillsa balloon drifting away on the wind Really simple but extremely efficient methods to reflect the ominous actions that just took place Other than to focus on the further actions of the killer Lang turns to the effect this terror has on the city and how the manhunt for Beckert develops Our director is obviously fascinated by how a police procedure is organized and he serves the viewer a detailed overview of all the steps taken by the investigators Meanwhile he grabs the opportunity to forcefully criticize the medias influence and the German law system with both hands Id really like to stress that Langs subtle mockery was a really risky thing to do with the upcoming Nazireign so you cant admire him enough Due to the constant and fruitless raids the police are holding in the hope to capture the killer the criminal underworld begins to lose its profits as well and they start their own manhunt for the killer assisted by whores beggars and petty thieves With the carefully observing eyes all over town it becomes practically impossible for Becker to satisfy his monstrous needs The almighty Peter Lorre arrives late in the film every moment hes on screen is a moment worth treasuring His sad appearance and cruel testimony are sequences that leave no human being unmoved Lorre is a brilliant actor and this is inarguably one of the most impressive performances of all time M features constant tension outstanding dialogue and stunning camerawork As said before Fritz Lang had the opportunity to work with sound for this film and he immediately makes the most out of this This was the first big German production that featured sound and it STILL ranks as the title that made best use of itand that sure means something after more than  years Theres the chilling and legendary tune Lorre constantly whistles but also the absence of sound Lang uses to portray the besieged city As you can tell from the above review M is absolute mustsee and easily one of the most essential productions ever shot Its lightyears ahead of its time and still disturbing after all these years This film is a mesmerizing portrait about the darkest most alarming aspects of humanity and yet still it doesnt live up to reallife facts As you probably know the plot of M is based on the whereabouts of the serial killer Peter Kürten who brutally murdered many victims in the city of Düsseldorf I read a biography on Kürten recently and the true details of his crimes and animallusts go beyond every filmmakers wildest imagination,10
1041,tt0022100,Since I loved Metropolis and was mesmerized by the great storyline of M I happily shelled out  euros to get the deluxe DVDset of Fritz Langs first talkie fully expecting I was going to view it over and over againWell that was  euros I should have spent on a new haircut or something This is a very boring film one that is only somewhat redeemed by a great Peter Lorre and an interesting final scene But the first hour was sooo slooow! Low point was a tenminute scene in which four boring men were having a roundtable about deciding what to do about the child killer No camera movement whatsoever just blabbering and no oneliners either Hes a killer for heavens sake  ACTION! DO SOMETHING! STOP HIM! Looking back maybe I was even more mesmerized by the brand M The film posters are great and that single M just makes for a classic even harrowing logoStill I honestly cant believe that a modern viewer would actually enjoy this,4
1042,tt0022100,From the elongated opening scene of M you know you are in for more than a simple film could ever imagine The elongated lunch scene as a mother waits for her daughter to return as we audience members watch the daughter stray from her journey home with a stranger with a sharpened whistle It is foreboding it is depressing it is mesmerizing It has been a very long time since a film especially one made  years ago seemed so delicate so thought provoking so timeless as M does From these opening shots Lang lets us know that this isnt going to be your happy utopia where criminals are caught the next day by the police and our world goes back to liquorish and lollipops but instead a world where the locals collect like a mob and trust is thrown violently out of the window With excellent cinematography and a strong balance between humor and honesty Lang creates this visceral world where the line between truth and justice get blurred where good and evil are similar and a man defines his actions as uncontrollable This merely scratches the surface of M a masterful film that ranks amongst the best this world has offeredWhat makes M shoot ahead of anything modern anything by cult directors anything close to popular? It begins with the actors goes to the man behind the camera and finally the skillful craftsmanship of the story Each of these elements never lack never fall behind and constantly build upon each other until that final breath that encourages you to repetitively rewatch To begin Peter Lorre How could you not talk about M without mentioning this doeeyed murderer From the beginning we know his role in this film yet Lang pulls every emotion out of us as we follow his route We feel sympathy for Lorre when he is tried we feel scared when he is trapped in the attic we feel hatred when he voyeuristically looks at the children  and yet he isnt the only character in this film Lang introduces us to other well placed personas throughout The infamous Inspector Lohmann not to mention that great floorup shot is the perfect example of Langs impressions on the local German police The fact that Lohmann whistles counter productive to what Lorre represents only solidifies that idea To add to these already dynamic people we have the background criminals that decide to take the matter into their own hands in hopes to eliminate the looming police presence The Safecracker is idealistic of what Germany was to become the classic SS look with the idea of eliminating the opportunity to be tried in a true court of law Each one of these characters provide humor excitement and fullblown emotion to the screen adding to the overall impact to this film With Lorre already bedazzling us with his range and taut emotion it is up to Fritz Lang himself to ensure that edits angles and direction doesnt hinder the power of his actors Lang steps up to the plate and delivers with his avantgarde film making I use the words avantgarde because the techniques used in this film are far beyond  Lang incorporates powerful closeups amazing track following and shots nearly unseen at this time The overhead shots the ability to make the crowds look ravenous the camera puns adds just as much as another lead would If you were impressed by his ability in Metropolis M is only going to solidify that idea of Lang A favorite is the raid on the office complex by a group of criminals Every shot every detail is directed with ease but complexity It is easy to be in awe of this film but to take the time to see Langs ability behind the camera will take M to a whole new level Personally it is my belief that he announces himself with this film A pioneer of the camera a grandfather of what cinema is today  one cannot watch anything released today and not see Langs influences See Finchers Zodiac a nearly identical film in themes to what Lang was trying to produce hereFinally we have acting and direction but one must also credit the story for being not just creative and unflinchingly original but for supporting a strong message The idea of being more careful was impressive to watch due to the time being  a time well thought of that children could be anywhere without any worry The story brings evil into an American thought that good guys always prevail that suburbia is always safe and that the police actually do keep the streets safe The story of M challenges you as a viewer even today one could argue even more so today than in  With crimes continually on the rise in this country with the idea that pleading insanity cures the disease of murder or is an easy innocence the idea of M especially that final dialogue seems more important today The fascination also arises with the concept of the mob within this story  the horror that simple events kindness even could turn on anyone in a moment of panic Police arresting anyone that even looks at children in a peculiar way  a fascinating concept that Lang is not afraid to develop Imagine if this film were made two years later what a different theme Lang would have tackledA deeply enticing film Fritz Lang proves that he was a ground breaker in his field Not only could he handle Science Fiction but nearly every other genre imaginable M is no exception to his skill If you have not seen this film watch it  experience it  know what it means to be marked like Lorre Grade ***** out of *****,10
1043,tt0022100,Im a fan of Peter Lorres and I love black &amp; white films  I enjoy foreign films  I even like trying to twist my brain around mindboggling symbolfilled convoluted art flicks  But I was incredibly disappointed in *M*It had a lot of potential but it kept drowning in itself  It took me a while to understand this  The plot itself wasnt overly complex  so why did I still have the feeling of unpleasant confusion  What I finally realized is that *M*s downfall is that it cant decide what it isI went into it with a general understanding of what it was going to be about and knowing Peter Lorres work I had certain expectations  The parts of the movie that were most satisfying to me were those which fit those expectations a tense shadowy atmosphere made all the more eerie and suspenseful by the skillful use of In the Hall of Mountain KingOther parts of the movie felt more like a police procedural  There is certainly a place for the Ed McBains of our world but that place is not being mixed in with Robyn Cook  These segments felt out of place and they jarringly interrupted the mood created by the spookier more emotionally taut scenesThe muchapplauded ending had the same problem for me it suddenly introduced yet another mood  that of introspection and social consciousness  This was too distinct from either of the other two moods to feel as if it were even part of the same pictureEach mood each theme each general strain could have been very good on its own  but as a package the film felt illblended  And as much as I enjoy paradox and even confusion they are not in of themselves sufficient criteria for a good film,3
1044,tt0025316,Frank Capras idealistic outlook on life is evident in his films From It Happened One Night to Its a Wonderful Life Capra has always had a tendency to let the little guy rise above it all and beat the odds It is no small wonder that Capra enjoyed much of his success during the Depression when movies were used to truly pull an audience out of the despair of the s into a world where anything can happen where being a nice person is all you need to succeed While the fact that the country was in the middle of the Depression was not completely ignored an overly optimistic view on life was taken to counter the despair of everyday lifeThere were many points in It Happened One Night where the true state of the country was indicated Homeless people hitching rides on trains seemed perfectly normal Rather than regard them with apprehension and pity you smile and wave at them Another example is the hostile reaction proprietor Zekes wife had to the fact that her husband had let Peter and Ellie stay the night with promises of being paid Upon seeing Peter and Ellies car missing they rush to the cottage to see if Peter and Ellie are still there They cannot afford freeloadersIn another scene a childs mother has passed out from hunger because they have no money to buy food Peter and Ellie have nearly depleted their funds but decide that the mother and child need money more than they do and give some to themDespite these instances the movie was altogether cheerful in its depiction of the world In the throes of the stock market crash this movie signaled the birth of the screwball comedy At a time when the country needed release they could find that release and laughter in movies like It Happened One Night Audiences were amused by scenes in the film such as the segment in which Peter teaches Ellie how to dunk a donut Or when forced to share a room Peter puts a blanket between his and Ellies beds and calls it the `wall of Jericho which is revisited when the walls of Jericho come tumbling down after Peter and Ellies marriage Probably the most famous scene in the film is the hitchhiking sequence which features Peter standing by the roadside trying to thumb a ride unsuccessfully finally giving up after more than a dozen cars speed by without paying any heed to his attempts After he gives up beaten Ellie simply lifts her skirt above her knee The first car that passes stops as we see extreme closeups of a foot slamming down on the brakes and a hand applying the hand brakeA master in his profession Capra left his mark on the films he directed With an almost childlike cheerfulness he maintains a sense of dignity and class The viewer is left with a feeling of hope for humankind even if its only that a persons ideals could be used to make such a film Capras films are still regarded as masterpieces It Happened One Night arguably remains to this day unparalleled in screwball comedies It was one of many movies made during the Depression a sometimes sad and even lonely time in our history It gave its audience a chance to escape and forget their troubles for a few moments in time out of  stars,9
1045,tt0025316,In his autobiography The Names Above the Title Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters the hero the heroine the comedian and the villainWhat Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films the characters of hero and comedian are combined Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself especially with that system all her own But in doing what he did for Clark Gables character Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the moldCapras autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio along the lines of Republic or Monogram As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it Capra also had a stroke of good luck Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day drunk as a skunk is priceless Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldnt have been more cooperativeAt some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day So the publicity drums were beatThe rest as they say is history It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam Best Picture Best Director Best Actor and Best Actress It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios And it set the standard for screwball comedyThe film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert Theyre together for most of the film so if it doesnt click between the two of them you have people walking out in droves Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in Gable and Colbert did only one other film together Boom Town for MGM You cant get much more different than those two films Boom Town had a huge MGM budget Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein Its also a great film but its not a classic like It Happened One Night,10
1046,tt0025316,It Happened One Night directed by Frank Capra was made and released in  by Columbia Pictures as a small budget film that was not expected to do well at the box office Yet after its release the film gained many accolades and won the Academy Award for best picture in  Due to the original small nature of the film the leading man role was surprisingly filled by Clark Gable who was on loan from another studio He stared opposite of Claudette Colbert Capras film was a combination of many ideals emotions and social perceptions of the American society of the thirties but it was also a combination of many new and innovative filming techniques and sound advancements The film unfolds the story in such a attentiongrabbing and remarkable way that most of todays cinema use his style and ideals when producing and creating films Capra used the idea of a moving camera one that was not fixed upon a box but on a moveable crane instead This produced more sweeping shots more angles for filming and fewer distance shots It allowed for more movement of the actors as well as a more realistic and real life feeling to the movie The film also incorporates back projection of images This is were a scene is filmed previously and played in the background while the actors perform the scene in front of the projection Back projection is used for car scenes to give the impression that the actors are driving but in reality they are in a sound stage Capra also incorporated the use of a wipe in his film The technique of moving left to right and fading in or out to change a scene or show elapsed time took the place of the traditional place cards in silent films and allowed for a more constant stream for the film The film was also all talk the new technology of a sound strip on the side of the film was used The text cards of silent films were completely discarded Another camera trick by Capra is to show a change in feelings within Clark Gables character for Claudette Colberts character by depicting her character in a different light This happens two times within the film at key moments to the development of their relationship Claudette Colbert is seen in a close up of softer light to emphasize Clark Gables character seeing her in a `different light In this romantic comedy Capra not only showed new styles and techniques but also addressed social issues of the time Through comedy he showed the outlandish nature of the rich King arriving for his own wedding in a helicopter and the nature of man being the controller in relationships as well as in society The fighting and struggles between the two main characters showed the man taking care of the woman the social norms of how men and woman should act around each other in that era But the fighting and the banter also show a strongminded and intelligent woman The two strongwilled main characters balanced each other outCapras techniques for showing the social relationship between the rich and working classes as well as a relationship between man and woman in the s captured film makers and film viewers for over  years Films are now compared to his style of camera movement and his style of capturing the American ideals When movies of today make a similar statement of achieving what one wants they are referred to as Capraesc Capras imagination and style is one that changed the outlook of American films and introduced a new genre to film goers everywhere,0
1047,tt0025316,IHON rightly earns its place as one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history A pioneer of the screwball comedy genre it holds up very well  years after it was madeIts a classic tale of the battle of sexes something that is still so relevant today We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Claudette Colbert who jumps ship from her fathers yacht literally! in Florida after an argument with said father played by Walter Connolly over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley Jameson Thomas without her fathers consent Ellie is on a mission to get to New York to King Westley But how will she do it? Thats how Peter Warne played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable comes into the story Recently fired from his newspaper job Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York and realizing who she is Her story is all over the news after all! offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story to win him back his job And so the fun begins Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances The trip isnt a smooth one and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie which gives us great scenes such as the doughnutdunking lesson Walls Of Jericho and the nowclassic hitchhiking scene The humour is still fresh and fastpaced over  years later Oops I almost forgot the classic no undershirt scene where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses to reveal shock horror! no undershirt but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of mens undershirts which dropped dramatically after the films release One of the first examples of product placement in film Great supporting characters particularly the scenestealing Oscar Shapeley Roscoe Karns Of course it has its faults all early talkies do But any faults are outweighed by the great story Technically it was wellmade for its timeIHON won  Oscars Best Picture Best Director Frank Capra Best Actress and Best Actor for Colbert and Gable and Best Adaptation It deserved all of them Funnily enough both Colbert and Gable didn&amp;#;t want any part in the film at first I bet they changed their viewpoint after the surprise success and the prestigious Academy Awards they gained for it Its been said that a number of Disney characters like Bugs Bunny Yosemite Sam and Pepe LePew were inspired by characters in this film A classic a mustsee a great movie,10
1048,tt0025316,This is a pleasant funny classic that shows it age only slightly and that has a lot of scenes you can look forward to each time that you see it Gable and Colbert each get roles that are nicely suited to them and are wellremembered for their performances  The supporting cast also rounds out the picture with some good character actingThe crosscountry trip on the bus and via other assorted methods is fun to watch with several nice vignettes that complement the main story line The atmosphere on the long bus trip is done especially well  The plot is of course not meant to be taken too seriously in itself but it comes in very handy for setting up good characters and comedyIt all comes across as effortlessly entertaining romantic comedy with some classic scenes and characters you learn to care for in spite of their mistakes,0
1049,tt0025316,This sweet comedy never loses its appeal  Claudette Colbert is a spoiled young girl who meets a wordly attractive newspaper reporter Clark Gable In the beginning she treats him like a servant but he never knuckles under to this behavior  The interaction between these two is very romantic and humorous  It is the classic portrayal of what may be called sexual tension  He takes care of her  does not take advantage of her  but makes her realize that her wealthy background cannot carry her through as a human being she has to earn his respect by treating him with respect  There is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike and their breakfast is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find  As Gable stands at the edge of the road and Colbert is perched atop a wooden fence his wisecracking posture is said to be the inspiration for the beloved cartoon character Bugs Bunny  This is a mustsee for every one who loves old movies and entertaining for all,10
1050,tt0025316,It Happened One Night is one of those films that is so classic and on so many `mustsee lists that I actually assumed that I had seen it at one time or another  It wasnt until I actually looked into the film when I in fact realized I hadntThe first film to sweep the major categories in an Oscar ceremony It Happened One Night spins the story of a young spoiled heiress Colbert who marries a shallow yet dashing aviator  She is then swept off by her father who takes her on a cruise; convinced that time away from each other will cure her infatuation  Instead she escapes by jumping out of the boat and swimming to shore where she begins her journey from Miami to New York where her husband awaits  The film quickly turns into an `on the road flick at this point when she meets up with Clark Gable a down on his luck reporter who offers to help her for the exclusive rights to her story  Mayhem inevitably ensues as one thing after another goes wrong during their adventureIm a little hesitant to completely agree with the general assessment that It Happened One Night is a screwball comedy  Of course there were certain moments that were hilarious and overdone the scene when Gable and Colbert pose as husband and wife to share a cabin for the night is absolutely rich but the majority of the remaining film is clever romantic comedy with fairly even performances by the principles  Perhaps there is a sliding scale for screwball comedies with It Happened One Night being a two and a film that I feel personifies the genre Bringing up Baby as a five,8
1051,tt0025316,Consider this It Happened One Night was made in  which gives it the distinction + years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences And most of the runnerups for oldest film are s screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the  Academy Awards The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant The main reason It Happened One Night worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capras direction Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut Cohn told Capra That French broad likes money and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $ double her usual price and a guarantee that production would only last  days Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this filmThe film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra a great script that would play well with small town America and a good ensemble of supporting talent The story concerns a spoiled young heiress Colbert trying to escape the control of her father nicely played by Walter Connelly Dodging her fathers private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter Gable who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other brainless brat and obnoxious bully as an undisclosed affection develops On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each otherWhile the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film As another reviewer has written Far from loveydovey the dialogue is witty sharp and occasionally heartless We may know the outcome but the road to get there is paved with arguments anger and misunderstandings Its also clever funny and a bit risqué for   During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult motivated by a desire to improve her companions opinion of her Gable shows real star presence playing a confident charming and resourceful gentleman By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partnerAfter the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director OscarThen again what do I know? Im only a child,9
1052,tt0025316,I have seen this movie a few times over the year and have just recently  viewed it again twice on the DVD version This is a highly recommended  movie on several levels First it has to be seen because it won  multiple academy awards during  It has won at least best actor best actress and best director  So it should be seen just for its historical significance if you are  into movies as an art form However if you are just looking for  entertainment then it is simply a great classic romantic comedy The  set up is that Ellie Claudette Colbert is a rich spoiled  independent woman who is running away from her father in Florida to  join her husband not quite a complete marriage in New York City She  meets Peter Clark Gable on the bus who is a down &amp; out reporter  looking for a big story They join forces in that he will help her to  get to New York for an exclusive on her story In essence it is the  bratty socialite vs the hard nosed know it all reporter  Can they  achieve true love? Just watch the movie and figure it out for  yourself There is the classical scene regarding the battle of the  sexes which involves hitchhiking There is some dated material because  the movie was made in the s about the s This may be both good  and bad as a viewing experience Gable is a bit too shallow as a  desirable character He lacks the sensitivity of a guy that would be in  a modern romantic comedy However his portrayal of Peter is likely  typical for the ideal man of the era in that he attempted to be  competent and in charge at all times the know it all guy The  character comes across as too simplistic by todays standards However  when he gets the feedback on his rough edges from Ellie he shows his  nice guy side Claudette Colbert is great in this movie she had  opportunities to display her acting craft as she responded to different  situations The scene in which she and Gable pretended to be basically  white trash was very funny Her getting the best actress award is  very evident even without having to see the performances of her  rivalries for the Oscar in  Overall this movie is rated a  and  is highly recommended A viewer may avoid older movies because they  lack dept; however hang in for this one Once the screen chemistry  starts between Colbert and Gable their first scene together the rest  of the picture is just a joyride of entertainment in watching these two  work their magic for the camera Enjoy this movie it should be an  awesome experience,0
1053,tt0025316,In my college film class we had begun watching It happened one night I was laughing my head off But of course my professor stops the movie right when it was getting good After that I wanted to see this movie so badly My father lucky enough had the movie I watched it and it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen Clark Gable is histerical He really does a great job in the film I always did prefer the old comedies to today Do you blame me? If you watch the flick you will enjoy it This is one of the first romantic comedies Itll send all the others to the back of the bus I would higly recommend this movie Its a classic/,10
1054,tt0025316,Released in  Frank Capras It Happened One Night ushered in a new era of Hollywood filmmaking  the screwball comedy  and made Academy Award history in the process It became the first film to be awarded the top five awards on the night Best Picture Director Actor Actress and Screenplay a feat that remained unequaled until One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  and The Silence of the Lambs  As I watch more of his films Frank Capra is fast becoming one of my most respected directors with such classics as Mr Smith Goes to Washington and Its a Wonderful Life ranking among my favourites of all time This screwball comedy however posed a certain problem since Ive never been a huge fan of the subgenre Whilst I had enjoyed such films as My Man Godfrey and His Girl Friday they hadnt really offered anything other than comedy This means that they did a good job of making us laugh but never really inspired any other emotions  which isnt necessarily a handicap but doesnt appeal to my tastesHappily Im able to announce that It Happened One Night did surpass my expectations and I found it to be a wonderfullyenjoyable very touching romantic comedy The first half had left me feeling a bit uncertain since it reminded me of just about every other s comedy Id seen but then Frank Capra did what Frank Capra does best he put a lot of heart into the film After building towards a perfect fairytale ending Capra suddenly snatches it away slowly but surely stacking the odds against our hero However the director has never been one to leave us with a downbeat ending and when love finally prevails it feels twice as triumphant Of course crucial to the films success are the two lead performers Claudette Colbert and Clarke Gable playing characters of completely polar characters As story runs its course we slowly watch their relationship transform from completely dislike to acceptance to romance and it never feels forced or artificial despite a reportedly tense atmosphere onsetThe plot of the film was based on the story The Night Bus by Samuel Hopkins Adams Ellie Andrews Colbert is the arrogant spoilt heiress of a wealthy father Walter Connolly After she marries the rich but unprincipled King Westley Jameson Thomas against her fathers will Ellie strikes off to New York to be with the man she loves and her desperate father launches a statewide attempt to retrieve her It is on a night bus that Ellie strikes up a frictional relationship with fired journalist Peter Warne Gable whose only initial interest in the stranded girl is a good newspaper story Probably one of the best road movies ever made It Happened One Night also has a few twists in the usual formula which have guaranteed its enduring stature For example Ellies father is revealed not to be an evil overbearing demon but is in fact shown to be a very kind reasonable and loving man who is only trying to guarantee the best for his daughter by ensuring that she marries somebody with principles King Westley later gives up the girl without a fuss compensated by a tidy sum of moneyMuch to my surprise Id never seen a film starring Clarke Gable before but he really was a revelation Never taking any situation too seriously and delivering every line with confidence and a hint of amusement Gable is the laidback everyman that the audience can relate to a stark contrast to Colberts conceited and ungrateful upperclass rich girl My favourite scene took place after the night bus accidentally ran off the road with the shifty passenger Oscar Shapeley Roscoe Karns threatening to reveal Ellies true identity Fearing that his exclusive story could leak into other hands Peter Warne declares himself to be the gangster who kidnapped Ellie threatens to harm Shapeleys family and then chases him into the night Interestingly I followed up my viewing of this film with a  Lux Radio Theater broadcast of the story introduced by Cecille B DeMille and once again starring Gable and Colbert This recording can be found if youre lucky as a special feature on the It Happened One Night DVD and its well worth a listen,8
1055,tt0025316,I was inspired to think of other films with completely mystifying titles `The Phantom Menace obviously  Also `The Shop Around the Corner around the corner from WHERE? `The Empire Strikes Back it doesnt `The Living Daylights `True Lies `Batman Forever `Species `The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp  if anyone has any more suggestions please send them to meIn this case it happens over several nights and Im not sure which particular night is being referred to  Probably one of the candidate nights is less unobvious than the rest; so I guess the title isnt COMPLETELY mystifying  But actually Capra gives us the feeling that everything is up in the air  Everyone knows that the hero and heroine of romantic comedies are bound to get hitched in the end  in most cases its simply a question of staying awake  But Capra makes us feel the contingency of it all  I for one was convinced that right up until the final moment it could have gone either way  How did Capra manage this?  Was it because he was a complete innocent; or was it because he was remarkably sophisticated?  I dont suppose it matters its results that countIm glad to see very little mention among the comments about the sexism of it all  The characters have life; their words have life; and if such art as this could only be produced by a sexist society its almost worth creating a sexist society and then dismantling it in order to get the art  In modern romances I get the feeling that the writers are wearily writing `feisty lines for the heroine in an attempt to fool feminists who by and large arent so easily fooled  Claudette Colbert isnt feisty  When she DOES assert her independence she means itAnd of course when Clark Gable asserts his dominance HE means it  You dont get sincerity like this these daysAnyway the ideology of a film if there is one is always beside the point except inasmuch as the ideology is AESTHETICALLY attractive or unattractive This is an attractive film  Two real individuals a real story some misunderstanding but no tiresome or pointless misunderstanding constant wit  and as I expressed amazement at earlier constant suspense  And if THAT isnt enough to get you to watch it note that it was released in   The Hayes code didnt come into effect until   Not a moment too late,10

1057,tt0025316,Capras It Happened One Night is a fascinatingly shot romantic comedy It has the s feel but at the same time I am surprised that such skill was used in the making of this movie during the s The camerawork is brilliant as it brings out both the spatial feel and the crowdiness the long shots are effective and I liked how the scenes change in a sideways flip mode Theres always something about the driving scenes of old classics that amuse me Clearly the background was shot separately and then projected on to a screen during the shooting of the film while in the foreground the actors are just seated in a car pretending to drive While the background scene changes the viewer keeps tuned to the wonderful dialogue between the actors Needless to add the films got fantastic dialogueCapra also brilliantly gives us a glimpse of the s American society especially focusing on gender and class status The difference between the upper class rich people and the common ordinary man is shown by their use of language and their nonverbal behaviour Yet in a way the film is also ahead of its time Ellie isnt just some clichéd damsel of the s She is strongminded stubborn and smart albeit slightly naive She is one who fights for what she wants rather than giving in easily Perhaps this is also one quality of hers that attracts Peter but at the same time their funny quarrels also indicate that there is a an equality in gender status which was something women were struggling with in those daysThe characters are very well etched Peter and Ellie were a lot of fun but I also liked how Alexander Andrews played excellently by Walter Connolly was written as the rich father whos got all the money but all he wants for his daughter is her happiness Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are great together as they match wits and display warm chemistryIt Happened One Night has become an instant favourite one that I definitely plan to revisit,0

The story here is so damn simple that you may at first think that everyone could be able to pull it of but when you think about it you will realize that at the same time its actually very clever carefully written and touching Take this scene for instance Ellen is looking in front of herself while a burglar steals her luggage behind her back She doesnt notice anything but Peter sees this and runs after the burglar Ellen still not turning around is wondering where he is running of to After a while Peter all tired returns and says He got away! And Ellen not knowing whats going on replies I dont know what you are talking about! Thats a perfect example how someone is trying to be a gentleman and ends up as a fool But this is actually a film more touching than funny After a while the spoiled Ellen shows her gentle side and realizes that she loves Peter She says this to her father in tears because she thinks that Peter doesnt love her So incredibly magical and yet so simple Its incredibly high grade of / on the site rottentomatoescom is justified Too bad almost all TV stations are keeping this jewel of air for decades! No wonder my generation is trapped in a vicious circle of violence drugs and alcohol They never got a glimpse of such previous generations with a soul and such raw honest and touching beauty like It happened one night which exceeds the human mindGrade /,10
1062,tt0025316,Its a true call that they dont make the movies as they used to There are very less movies coming near to the brilliance of It Happened One Night This movie is about a rich brat running from her home to get married with her lover accompanied with struggling free lancer reporter in her journey And in the journey they fall for each other The romance building between two of them is nicely depicted and the blend of Peter Warne Gables arrogant personality gives it a nice stir The story of the movie is very interesting and the comic attribute added by both Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is sufficed to make anyone laugh The perfect direction from the master of his domain Frank Capra takes the movie on highest level; because of this its the first movie to be honored with all major five Oscars Best Actor Best Actress Best Movie Best Director and Best Screenplay,10
1063,tt0025316,It Happened One Night happens to be my personal most favorite film ever It was an adapted screenplay by Robert Riskin from the short story Night Bus and was directed by Frank Capra With a simple story plot modest budget and a very short four week production schedule this film goes a long way Director Frank Capra obviously knew the story to tell and how to tell it Some of the best films are made in a surprisingly short amount of time and on a modest budget This film followed what Capra hoped would be a critical and box office success The hopes were low for this film even after securing stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert for the lead roles Columbia Studios was not well respected at the time in HollywoodIt Happened One Night  had a relatively small budget for its time $ of which Claudette Colbert asked for and received $ for her role A star receiving this much of the total film budget was unheard of during the s Released during Americas Great Economic Depression the film had excellent timing and proved to be a big critical and audience hit All the right elements came together It had a high quality comedic screenplay with believable characters in believable situations A film where luck and chemistry came together producing a film that exceeded the expectations of everyone involved including its director Frank CapraThe film comes across as light hearted and natural and with excellent timing and pacing For its time this style of film was new It would be one of the first of a new genre screwball romantic comedy Winner of five Academy Awards in all the major categories Best Picture Director Adapted Screenplay Actor in a Leading Role and Actress in a Leading Role was a first in Hollywood history Only two other films have swept the five top Academy Awards One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest  and The Silence of the Lambs Claudette Colbert was quoted as saying I just finished the worst film ever on It Happened One Night She had no idea how well the film would be edited The film editing here is subtle and sublime Colbert and Gable achieved that rare and special screen chemistry in the film Colberts demand that the film needed to be produced in four weeks because of her vacation schedule actually created the lively pace of the film working in its favor It Happened One Night is a fine example of a quality screenplay some good luck and a lot of chemistry all coming together producing an enduring and enjoyable comedy classicClark Gable comes across as completely natural and very entertaining The fun had while making this film shows partly in Gables performance Unfortunately he would not be cast in a comedic role again even after the big success of this film The studio system of the time demanded stars remain typecasted For Gable that meant macho romantic leading action manTo me It Happened One Night is the best ever romantic comedy film a gold standard for its genre Its lost none of its charm and naturalness since its release in  The look of the film dates it but it still delivers its original naturalness charm wittiness timing pacing and entertainment value Just about a perfectly made film,10
1064,tt0025316,It Happened One Night must have put on a smile on Depressionweary audiences way back in  Over  years later the magic still works due to the terrific combination of Gable Colbert and director CapraBut it almost didnt happen at allBoth Gable and Colbert tried desperately to get out of doing IHON In fact it appeared noone in Hollywood wanted the parts of Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews The tiny cashstrapped Columbia Studios was making this film with an untried comedy formula it looked a certain flop Pfft How wrong everyone was IHON swept the Academy Awards taking home all of the Major Awards including Best Actor and Actress Awards for Gable and Colbert It established the screwball comedy genre and the careers of its two stars and director CapraWhy is it so good? Well it has remained so fresh over the years that the laughs beat out almost every modern romantic comedy It doesnt have to rely on smut or toilet humour to satisfy the audience just a classic battle of the sexes we can all relate to Its witty the dialogue is snappy and fastpaced and the acting is near perfect So lets have a closer look at the plot of this gem Spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Colbert has just defied her father by marrying society aviator King Westley Her angry father wishes to keep Ellie away from her unsuitable husband and whisks her away on his private yacht Daddy hasnt counted on Ellies tenacity and will fed up with the fact her childish hungerstrike is going nowhere she literally jumps overboard When back on dry land she tries to make her way back to her husband by bus trip A series of unfortunate events bring out of work newspaper reporter Peter Warne into her life Cue the battle of the sexes! She has no money so she must accept his help; he knows who she is and to land the biggest scoop of his career he must deceive her whilst also helping her get back to Westley But problems arise when the pair inevitably start to fall in loveThis film is just the tonic that Depression audiences would have soaked up The parodying of the rich is sublime you cant help rooting for Gable who is a fine representative of the underdog It also has its risqué elements that Im surprised got past the Hayes Code that had just been enforced In particular Gables sexy lesson to a shocked yet interested Colbert on how a man undresses and the final breaking down the walls of Jericho scene When Gable undressed to reveal a bare chest with NO undershirt sales dropped off dramatically This would be one of the earliest examples of product placement in filmSome of my favourite scenes the donutdunking lesson the piggyback ride Gable and Colberts mock fight and the justifiably classic Hitchhiking scene Colbert beats the cocky Gable at his own game by proving that SHE doesnt have to use her thumb to pull a ride Instead she shows a bit of leg and stops a vehicle much to the horror of Gable Great stuff!This film almost singlehandedly established the great screwball comedy Colberts Ellie is the ultimate screwy damepaving the way for Lombard and Hepburn in the genre with Gables Peter a direct forerunner to the Fredrich March character in the screwball classic Nothing Sacred  This films holds a very important place in motion picture historyBest of all its so enjoyable/,10
1065,tt0025316,The first movie to sweep all the major Academy Awards this film is still popular today Thats probably so because the dialog between the two stars of the picture  Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert  is just great Those two make this fun to watch I enjoyed it however much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect The ending too was very weak Over the last  minutes the two stars go their separate ways until the very end and the story gets very stupidThe nice romance that had developed between the two seemed to have disintegrated when Gable left one early morning for good intentions but didnt tell Colbert The latter thought Gable ran out on her Hollywood in films of the s and s loved to have romances in which confusion abounded and everything was misinterpreted for the worstuntil the happy ending when the truth somehow would surface That same theme was in here along with yet another trivialization of marriage another common theme during the classic era Colbert says it herself in one line mentioning she doesnt care for this other guy but what the heck might as well get married whats the difference? Huh?If the scriptwriters here would have just kept the road part of this film going longer  with Gable and Colbert trading barbs  it would have been super Gable has the best lines an is the most fun to watch but Colbert can hold her own She looks really pixieish and cute although most of her closeups are done with a fuzzy lens another habit of filmmakers of that era had with female stars One of the film worlds most famous scenes is in this movie the hitchhiking scene in which the cocky Cable explains the different ways of successful thumbing in order to get a rideand gets nowhere while Colbert on her first try gets a car to stop immediately after she lifts up her skirt! That is still one of the great comedic scenes in movie historyOverall this is still one of the best comedies of The Golden Age even with its faults,8
1066,tt0025316,A cute love story that rivals any of the cookiecutter romantic comedies of today Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert play very well off of each other Sure its cheesy in parts but thats what makes these older movies so much fun,8
1067,tt0025316,Its been over eighty years since It Happened One Night debuted on screens and still it remains the quintessential romantic comedy to watch While being the influence of countless films since It Happened One Night is triumphant and timeless because of its great cast director and script At the start of the film we see the beautiful Ellen Andrews Claudette Colbert in Florida aboard her wealthy fathers luxury boat Ellen is planning to marry King Westley but her father disapproves of him and forces her to stay on the boat until he can find someone more suitable to his liking This leads her to run away and seek out Westly herself while her father puts out a highly publicized bounty for her return She boards a bus to New York and crosses paths with the charismatic Peter Warne Clark Gable Hes a gifted newspaper reporter who also has a drinking problem that constantly gets him in trouble Once Warne figures out who Ellen really is he proposes a plan to her He will escort her to New York for the rights to her story which has become a national headline While the seemingly mismatched pair goes on an adventure they eventually warm up and become close The plot flies at a freeflowing pace that allows for wickedly good oneliners The script is fantastic and allows for great comedic timing and also a sense of drama There is a bit of suspense as the willthey wontthey couple explore their feelings for each other While watching the film you get the sense that they will end up together but its never fully guaranteed and leaves room for you to doubt We meet several supporting characters that mostly never overstay their welcomes such as the bumbling Shapeley and boisterous Zeke They are great in the small amount of time they get and dont distract from the main narrative One minor problem with the story is that the geography is very confusing The audience is left out of the loop when it comes to knowing where exactly the leads are This makes it hard to track the importance of each settingThis is the prime example and maybe founding of the screwball comedy Screwball comedies tell the story of two leads often an unmarried man and woman that come from different social classes and how they interact with each other based on their previous lifestyles If you like films such as Heaven Can Wait and Raising Arizona you should thank this film for popularizing the genre Frank Capra won the academy award for Best Director for this film and he totally deserved it He balances his cast well and allows them to have total freedom within the cramped space of the frame He pushes the camera for claustrophobic scenes that force the actors to work together to make the physical comedy work The acting is the definite draw and best part of the film Both Gable and Colbert took home academy awards for their performances Gable will go down as one of the best romantic leads ever Hes handsome quick on his feet and witty He also delivers the perfect oneliners with confidence and swagger to make women want him and men to want to be him Colbert does an excellent job as the uptight and bratty female that so many leading ladies are still trying to replicate almost eighty years later She perfectly embodies a rich girl that is out of her element while in the real world She bounces off Gables laid back working man character with ease and her oneliners are just as good or even better than his Walter Connolly also does a good job as Ellies wealthy father Alexander Andrews He plays the overprotective but also understanding father At first he wants Ellen to marry someone rich and famous in order to boost his social status but after seeing her unhappiness he changes and sees the errors of his ways Hes one of those fathers that every girl wants and every man should strive to be It Happened One Night is the biggest influence on the romantic comedy genre Having the great pair of Gable and Colbert and Capra as the director lifts this film to the heavens of classic cinema Even in  the film is still fun and can be used to teach writers how to create good comedy,7
1068,tt0025316,OMG this film so hilarious clever and sweet It has original story and fresh idea about romantic comedy Clark Gable really did excellent job to bring this film more live He is so funny clever and comical Everything that he is doing in this film look so natural and funny Definitely one of Clarks best performance He really deserve an Oscar for his performance Chemistry between he and Claudette Colbert very delightful and cute Just simply romantic Bravo!!!,10

1070,tt0027977,Charlie Chaplins Modern Times  is the final film to feature the great actor/director/writers most easily recognizable incarnation The Tramp Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film Indeed several iconographic studies have labeled The Tramp with his worn hat distinctive mustache dusty suit cane and trademark waddle as the single most identifiable fictional image in historyStill the film that perhaps most influenced the creation and thematic realization of Modern Times was not even a silent one The Jazz Singer which debuted in  five years before Modern Times began production is perhaps the most important watershed film in the industrys centuryold history In the film comic great Al Jolson stands up in front of the audience andsings And as Millard Mitchell said in Singin in the Rain the public was suddenly in a frenzy for Talking pictures! Talking pictures! Sadly with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue the world of silent filmmaking began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable Nevertheless Chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating City Lights  which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made but by the time Modern Times was released Chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying artModern Times is not an entirely silent film there are dialogue snippets and sound effects but if you look closely every character with dialogue excluding Chaplin himself is being mocked Even when The Tramp opens his mouth the only time he ever did so in a film the words are nonsensical defying the burgeoning convention that dialogue is mandatory for substance entertainment and qualityDespite the films status as one of the greatest comedies of alltime it is hard to ignore the political component In his movies Chaplin often exhibited a great mistrust for authority and progress as often embodied through the social elite the police and wealthy entrepreneurs The irony of the films title then is twofold It connects with Chaplins own bitter feelings regarding his moribund art form but also refers to the plight of the working classes during the Great Depression long working hours with little job security and meager salary while the upper classes remain wealthy and bide their idle time The world was changing fast and Chaplin foresaw that many of these changes were far from beneficialAs we watch The Tramp struggle through the modern mechanized world we laugh at his antics and the absurdity of their results but we can also feel pain and pity He is clearly a man who does not belong Indeed The Tramp can almost be thought of as a misfit who has passed through a membrane from some alternate reality and unwittingly fallen into our familiar world notice that he does not have a name or identification of any kind and as far as we know he has no friends family funds or historyHe takes on assembly lines feeding machines department stores policemen and various other massoriented aspects of the industrialized world all which demand and exhibit sameness and conformity but The Tramp and his symbolic extension the individual never seem to fitThis is consequently why Modern Times is also one of the most poignant love stories ever put on film The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young homeless woman who is referred to as The Gamin and is played by Chaplins thenwife Paulette Goddard These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward despite adversity Both are nameless neither has a home and they each have no money or material possessionsIt is here that Chaplin makes his most poignant and saddening statement about modern living The Tramp and The Gamin are the only characters who exhibit individuality and idealism yet they are also the ones lowest on the social and economic food chain The conclusion of the film which most likely reflects upon Chaplins own emotions is tinged with sadness but also a lingering hopefulness that resonates as loudly and clearly today as it did more than sixty years agoThen there is of course the comedy which is the stuff of legendary status Some of the most memorable comic images in film history are found in Modern Times These include The Tramps bout with an assembly line and his resulting twitches his unfortunate encounter with nosepowder the moment when he quite literally becomes a cog in the wheels of industry and his epic struggle to bring roast duck to an angry customerIn my opinion however the two standout moments are the scene in a department store involving a blindfold and some rollerskates the most exquisite moment of comedy in the film and the sequence where The Tramp is submitted to the mad whim of an outofcontrol feeding machine the most uproarious moment in the filmThese are just a handful of moments that make Modern Times the enduring masterpiece that it is On a personal level the aspect of the film that resonates strongest with me is its appeal to the idealistic misfit in all of us In our hearts many of us long for the simplicity and exuberance with which The Tramp and The Gamin live life with attention to the bare essentials and an absence of need for materialism and modern trappingsAs Chaplin so skillfully shows however our modern times make this lifestyle a faded dream lost among the sheeplike herds of men and women scurrying through a modern metropolis that only Fritz Lang could make seem darker and more devoid of true humanity Still the final image of Modern Times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an everchanging world,10
1071,tt0027977,It is difficult to review Chaplins movies objectively because many of us have seen them or at least have heard about them since we were young They have become part of our emotional and/or cultural backgroundChaplin is arguably the only complete director in most of his pictures he also produces acts writes the script composes the music does his own stunts and edits His talent and reputation generated numerous commercial successes even when he continued directing silent movies after their time Talkies were the only films produced after  the few silent attempts afterwards were failures; yet Chaplin was an exception City Lights in  and Modern Times in  were sensations worldwide the latter includes a few sounds but they are marginal This is remarkable since nine years is an eternity in cinema timeframe Only in  did Chaplin direct a talkie*** WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS ***Is the movie a comedy? Partly tragicomedy is Chaplins trademark In my opinion there are three levels of humour Pure amusement sometimes as in slapstick the tramp eats all he can to be sent to jail and even buys more when he is with the policeman; he is drugged in jail; the tramp and the gamin imagine their life in an idyllic house; the tramp rollerskates close to an edge in the department store fabulous stunt; he makes a lousy waiter but a great actor at the end Again I am not certain how much of the fun is derived from childhood memories and/or the fact we feel younger as we watch the film To enjoy it fully we must lay aside some of our adult critical sense notably towards oldfashioned cinema No humour just drama the gamins father dies; her sisters are taken away; the tramp crashes his way through the crowd to get a job an efficient illustration of ruthless competition  Amusement with a dramatic twist these are the most frequent scenes and probably the best We grin even as we laugh The movie opens on sheep moving grouped of which a black one an allusion to the tramp? that fade out to workers coming out of the subway This must have been a shock for the audience during the Great Depression Another example is one of Chaplins most famous scenes ever the tramp tries the eating machine It is at the same time hilarious Chaplin really gives all of himself here and pathetic a metaphor on illconceived progress oppression of man by machine and conditions of workers obliged to comply with strange requestsOther scenes include the entire first part in the factory including when the tramp is stuck in the machine inside shot that became iconic which also happens to a colleague later on outside shot; the tramp launches by mistake an unfinished ship into the sea with footage of an actual ship that was probably sunk because of the Depression; the tramp and the gamin make most of their shabby hutThe movie efficiently alternates these three levels of humour as well as its rhythm It famously starts as a whirlwind with dynamic tempo and music And it ends like a rollercoaster funny musical the tramp sings emotional he is hired dramatic the police arrest the gamin thriller they run away as climatic music plays melancholic they are on the road free but uncertain The last image is rightfully doubleedged the tramp and the gamin walk away but mountains ahead block their road She looks like an elegant lady he looks a bit like a clown with his funny walk and big shoes We dont know where they are going nor do theyHence Chaplins ambition was far more than to just divert Themes depicted eighty years ago are still modern<ul><li>Crisis redundancies strikes inequalities social unrest</li></ul><ul><li>Working conditions in factories even though exaggerated by humour and symbols productivity control burnout</li></ul><ul><li>Technology that dehumanises chainworking the eating machine video surveillance a sciencefiction element at the time Remarkably the only sounds of the film are coming from devices not humans screen phonograph radio</li></ul><ul><li>Success with talent work and some luck</li></ul><ul><li>The law The topic is prominent the police are omnipresent and ambiguous Can one steal food to survive?

1072,tt0027977,Modern Times is in my top  films and # in my list of favorite comedies Charles Chaplin is arguably the most talented human being nevermind film maker that ever lived I first saw this treasure about  years ago and I watched it again recently to make sure that it really WAS funny and that I had not given it too much praise because it was simply a Chaplin film Modern Times passed my test with flying colors I laughed hysterically from start to finish Each and every scene is innovative well thought out and executed with the genius that only Chaplin possessed Among my favorite scenes are the automatic workerfeeding machine; the jail scene in the cafeteria when The Tramp accidentally sprinkles cocaine on his food thinking it is salt; and the roller skating scene in the department store No special effects or computer animation just pure simple geniusThe storyline in Modern Times is purposefully naive a trick Chaplin used time and again to bring a profound humanitarian quality to his films Watching this film is comparable to watching a Warner Bros cartoon which coming from me is a sincere compliment The level of physical comedy in Modern Times is on par with the masterful short films of Chuck Jones Friz Freleng and othersFinally as was the case with most of his later films Modern Times is a serious social commentary Its message is as relevant today as it was more than sixty years ago when it was released In fact it is arguably even more relevant today and unless the world changes drastically in the future it will continue to be Modern Times is essentially the story of a simple but extremely kind man caught in the traps of industrialized society The opening scene which compares a crowd of workers boarding the subway to a flock of sheep is Chaplins warning against standardization mechanization and other facets of life which rob men and women of their individuality Chaplin always tried to speak for the downtrodden because despite his enormous success and wealth he never forgot where he came from In the end Modern Times is a reminder that no matter how bad things are you can still smile Charles Chaplin has made more people smile than almost any other and his legacy of love and laughter lives on in his films Its up to us to keep his legacy alive,10
1073,tt0027977,Favorite Chaplin film Packed with social commentary that is still relevant today Chaplin does a superb job of representing the average worker of the time and the mental impact that the daily motions of what we consider normal in society Such as the opening of the movie in which a scene of a morning rush of people going to work fades into a herd of sheep Chaplin hilarious slapstick comedy is also present in this film while still keeping serious undertones The best example of this is the eating machine This particular scene was a perfect representation of the problems in our society a machine meant to further regiment the day of a worker only to break in the process while also causing a laugh out loud reaction My favorite part of this film is definitely the ending in which Chaplin sings a song and dances What makes this scene so great is not only the fact that it was the first time Chaplin/The Tramp ever spoke but that it was also a stance against talkies Although Chaplin sings the lyrics are complete gibberish but the audience understands regardless All in all I believe Modern Times is Chaplins greatest film this was the first Chaplin film I had ever seen and since then have watched all of them and found a great respect for Chaplin and silent movies overall,10
1074,tt0027977,It is a testament to Chaplins filmmaking skills that he is able to impose such significant meaning on what really boils down to little more than a series of comedy skits strung together on an apparently flimsy clothesline of a plot Indeed the cinematic value of Modern Times is unquestionable but it is ironically noteworthy that such a simple and even blocky plot is made into such a memorable film experience and delivers such a strong timetranscending message about poverty stricken populations,10
1075,tt0027977,Hilarious touching anarchic revolutionary realist surreal of its time timeless  Modern Times is a multifaceted work of genius When its over and you recall the number of sight gags and magic sequences Chaplin has packed into  minutes it is incredible  the conveyer belt and nut turning; Chaplin caught in the cogwheels; the feeding machine; the Red Flag march; the nose powder; the roller skating ballet; the waiter with tray caught up in the dance my favourite; the gibberish song  and many more Then there is his mixing of silent and sound techniques making the best of both worlds not falling between stools as some directors might have doneOf course there is also a political and social dimension; many of the scenes refer to the impact of technical advances of bureaucracy and of the then current depression on the ordinary little man And it is the little man the individual caught up in societys complex machinery whom Chaplin championed He may have sympathised with leftwing political parties and unions in so far as they supported ordinary working people but Chaplins essential beliefs are enshrined in the final words and shot with him telling Paulette Godard that she should keep smiling they will get along as they walk a couple of individuals into an uncertain future Beyond politics the individual has to rely on his or her own resources and spirit to survive,0
1076,tt0027977,This movie is a must see for anyone who loves comedies  Charlie Chaplin is at his alltime best as the Tramp and he has wonderful chemistry with Paulette Goddards Gamin  Together they provide an hour and a half of nonstop laughs  My favorite parts are when he is fed by a modern machine that goes awry and then when Charlie goes crazy in the factory  The situations and expressions are hilarious!  Please see this movie soonyou definitely will not regret it,10
1077,tt0027977,Greetings from LithuaniaModern Times  is my first movie which i saw that features Charles Chaplin Saw it first time in  but nevertheless its a great movie Comedy here is truly funny and its not just a comedy It tells a story with some underlying themes that are still kinda topical till this day – technology is changing evolving and if you are not keeping pace with it you will have some hard times like our hero of this movieActing here is very solid actually i was surprised of how well acted this movie was – no one overreacted Story itself is interesting and movie is very well paced – at running time  h  min it almost never drags and is entertaining from start till finishOverall Modern Times is a black and white silent movie there are some sounds actually which safely can be viewed for the first time even in  –  years after its original release It has some truly genuine comedic situations it tells good story and pacing of picture is very solid Maybe it is not possible to review this movie correctly now because its very old but great movies are great movies – they can be viewed no matter what,9
1078,tt0027977,Chaplins Modern Times has influenced the th century as much as any other film could have His portrayal of man vs machine individual vs group love vs industryis the framework of classic modern American antiprogressive thinking Gilliams Brazil is the late century equivalent But Chaplin hit it right first insuring generations would have the chance to relate to the challenges of their own modern times,10
1079,tt0027977,Long after most people thought the silent movie had been buried forever Chaplin brought his Little Fellow out of mothballs for one more magnificent motion picture The Tramp is trapped in a factory performing mindnumbing repetitive tasks and finally he goes hilariously berserk I started laughing the instant I saw the lady in the dress with the buttons Like City Lights this film is a collection of charming vignettes this time revolving around The Tramps desire to settle down with gamin Paulette Goddard From the Tramps encounter with an assemblyline feeding machine to his unsuccessful stints as night watchman and waiter this movie is packed full of delights Chaplin never speaks but he does sing a little This work of genius can make you smile though your heart is breaking,0
1080,tt0027977,Charles Chaplin seemingly had been pushed out of the movie business by the earlys due to the advent of sound a medium that just never seemed right with him Chaplin probably the best filmmaker/performer of the th Century did not despair though He fought back with heart and emotion and by  Modern Times was a major box office and critical success It is a movie that quietly showed a man suffering through a world of change As a factory worker in the film Chaplin tries to cope with the industrial revolution and tries to make it through a quickly changing US economy He finds love with vagrant Paulette Goddard who ended up marrying Chaplin in real life and the two come together and lean on one another in a world of uncertainty and change Modern Times is one of those films that will put a smile on your face but it could make you weep just as easily Chaplins world was changing and not necessarily for the better from his point of view and he wanted to express the variations in his old way of doing things and the new way everyone else had accepted Goddard is also probably the best actress to match Chaplins charm in one of his pictures Their love for one another even though the marriage lasted a relatively short amount of time in real life just seems to shine on the silver screen and they have a chemistry that is sweet and heartwarming Beautifully made wonderfully written perfectly performed smart insightful and always brilliant Modern Times is another film from Chaplin that will brand itself on the souls of all true lovers of the cinema  stars out of ,0
1081,tt0027977,This is absolutely the finest film Charlie Chaplin ever madewhich considering the overall quality of his work says a great deal for the quality of the film  Genius is a much overused word but in Chaplins case its use is apt  This is one of the classics of cinema and one of the greatest films ever made!  The scenes in the factory are hilarious You have got to see this film!  Most joyously totally and highly RECOMMENDED!!!!!,10
1082,tt0027977,Somehow this very old film is particularly modern today and the exaggerations are not really sooo extreme compared with the real world The humans enslaved by the machines and by those who control them become more and more small and insignificant like the hero of this very funny comedy one of the best in the history that speaks about very ugly things in a very amusing way The Tramp is not a tramp in the beginning He has a real job in a modern factory that almost kills him as the factory becomes more and more modern He becomes a tramp when he stays without a job Picking up red flags in the street can get you in a big problem with the police who are there to serve and protect the rich An honest man can stay honest even in prison and get benefits from this Even a new job But honesty is not really enough Trouble is always around the corner and modern society doesnt permit you to make a new start easilyLove gives you wings or at list hope and the power to continue A beautiful girl of the streets is more than our hero is asking for and he is ready to do whatever necessary Even put his safety in danger to take care of her And she appreciates this In the end when everything is lost once again all they are left with is each other and thats all they really needFor the first time is his cinema career our Tramp will find a girl that will stick with him and support him Chaplin obviously felt with Paulette Goddard something that he didnt feel for his earlier women and I dont blame himAnd this story of modern times like all of Chaplins films will end up with an optimistic feeling in a unhappy end Never is everything lostWith obvious inspiration from Fritz Langs Metropolis and maybe René Clairs À nous la liberté it made the strongest point about THE where we re going in all the cinema of the s I think  and with only Marx bros Duck soup being able to stand anywhere close to it Maybe the most complete funny and mature creation of the best comedian of the seventh art with a lot more than a non stop production line of great jokes to offer If made without a single joke this film would still be one of the greatest of all of our modern times,10
1083,tt0027977,Modern Times begins with a shot of sheep going down a runway followed by a shot of workers entering a factory Charlie is set down in the midst of industrial civilization which is dominated by machinery and in which men are organized into mechanical units Capital and Labor Charlies real enemies are no longer the Cop or the Boss with whom he can always enter into some human relation but a vast impersonality invisible and invulnerable Modern Times offered a variety of minor attractions it featured Chaplins wife Paulette Goddard; it had wonderful gags; it indulged in tricks of sound which came to the very edge of being dialog But what did the picture mean what was it trying to say? Because Chaplin charged his usual enormous percentage for it and because of foreign receipts Modern Times made money but exhibitors were not happy at the limited audience turnout For the majority the new Charlie was too serious; for the minority not serious enoughSince the picture seemed to be about the dehumanizing effect of machinery intellectuals called upon Chaplin to join them in reorganizing machine culture to some more human scale of thingsOff the screen Chaplin said nothing On the screen his anarchic hostility for any kind of machine culture expressed itself in scenes like that in which Charlie is fed by a machine and that in which crazed by the assembly line he runs into the street his arms moving convulsively like two pistons Charlie the rebel Charlie the poet Charlie the invincibly human had been turned into a machine,8
1084,tt0027977,Modern Times exemplifies Depressionera America; a stream of disappointments tattered dreams and missed chances that attempt to drag the characters down but are defied by the ever buoyant hope of the American DreamScenes from Modern Times aptly capture the mood of America in the late s; men superimposed by sheep shuttled into a waiting line workers being pushed to go faster and faster eventually consumed by the very machine they deigned to control Yet elements of optimism shine through the weary filmChaplin and his gamin dream of a home of their own with cows ready to be milked and steaks crackling on the stove Though their realitya depilated shack Is no Buckingham Palace the two are able to sustain themselves on the American Dream of a more secure fruitful lifeSeveral aspects of the film called to mind a type reality Though  was written in   years after the birth of Modern Times including the large two way screen in the factory allowing the owner to be Big Brother to the workers as well as the police brutality and Ford factory line of men and machineThe film ends appropriately; dusty and bruised from pursuit hardship and hunger Chapin and his orphan girl head of hopefully into the sunset convinced of a better reality awaiting them on the suns return; a hope shared by many in Americas Modern Times,7
1085,tt0027977,I saw this as a child and my laughter at the feeding machine scene was so WILD that I have never laughed so hard at anything again in my entire life I literally slid out of my chair to the ground gasping for air The whole film is absurd and brilliant crisply realized by a comedy genius but for me that one moment transcends even greatness and touches the sublime where is poetry and God Seeing the feeding machine again as an adult there are tears mixed with laughter To eat is to live it is the personal realm and the invasion of the authoritarian state into the personal realm is so arrogant and pompous that it frightens me a lot to see how far it has gone as they regulate our speech our food our sex lives according to the latest PC doctrines of nice Chaplin would not have recognized this new world of ours where the working class he represents here is ruled by progressive billionaires spouting inanities,10
1086,tt0027977,The hands of the cinema clock were set back five years last night when a funny little man with a microscopic mustache a battered derby hat turned up shoes and a flexible bamboo cane returned to the Broadway screen to resume his place in the affections of the filmgoing public The little man—it scarcely needs be said—is Charlie Chaplin whose Modern Times opening at the Rivoli restores him to a following that has waited patiently burning incense in his temple of comedy during the long years since his last picture was producedThat was five years ago almost to the day City Lights was its name and in it Mr Chaplin refused to talk He still refuses But in Modern Times he has raised the ban against dialogue for other members of the cast raised it but not completely A few sentences here and there excused because they come by television phonograph the radio And once—just once—Mr Chaplin permits himself to be heardThose are the answers to the practical questions They do not tell of Mr Chaplins picture or of Chaplin himself or of the comic feast that he has been preparing for almost two years in the guarded cloister in Hollywood known as the Chaplin studioBut there is no cause for alarm and no reason to delay the verdict further Modern Times has still the same old Charlie the lovable little fellow whose hands and feet eyebrows can beat an irresistible tattoo upon an audiences or hold it still taut beneath the spell of human tragedy A flick of his cane a quirk of a brow an impish lift of his toe and the mood is off; a droop of his mouth a sag of his shoulder a quick blink of his eye and you are his again a companion in suffering Or do you have to be reminded that Chaplin is a master of pantomime? Time has not changed his genius,10
1087,tt0027977,The mechanized and standardized world made of levers bolts department stores and lifts is too difficult or probably too ordinary for the honest and trustworthy Charlie Chaplin who always ends up trapped in his times But did this world really change a lot when nowadays we walk to the subway or we drive in crowded streets like cattle in order to reach our working place? In fact what Charlie Chaplin and the beautiful Paulette Goddard a close up of her face after The Little Tramp is arrested for the theft of a loaf of bread is magnificent really wants from modern times is a small decent house where to have dinner together an apple to grab by stretching your arm outside the window and fresh milk from a cow Charlie Chaplin doesnt need to speak on the screen while talking pictures were already widely produced since late s to deliver his brilliant view on s world; and even when he does talk during the floor show towards the end of the movie we dont need to understand what it is said to appreciate once more his talent and genius There are two moments that stand out during the movie the feeding machine that feeds The Little Tramp on the assembly line in the first part of Modern Times note also some similarities later when the mechanic assistant feeds his boss And the splendid final scene when before fading out The Little Tramp invites The Gamin to smile while walking on an empty street at dawn; a scene that alone is worth a full movie a smile that becomes the essence of the use of trying This last moment is full of hope and full of humanity; things that we still struggle for in our modern times,9
1088,tt0027977,Modern Times owes a lot to Metropolis despite the difference in tone You can see this especially in the first half with the giant gears and flywheels of the monstrous factory as well as the twoway TV intercom the boss uses to give ordersAlthough there is a lot of serious content  strikes riots poverty police killings  the serious and comic elements blend seamlessly You never get the feeling youre being lectured about anything youre laughing too muchThe element of tragedy lurking in the background makes the comedy that much stronger When Paulette Godard comes into the picture the tone changes from industrial to romantic And it must be said that she is one of the sexiest heroines to appear in an American film more surprising since its a farce Id go so far as to say that Godard outperforms Chaplin in this picture even if her later career was less notableYou have to see this movie before you can understand anything about the art of cinema,10
1089,tt0027977,Arguably Charlies best film  Maybe not his funniest but his best because theres so much more to it than the Keystone Kops kind of pratfalls that he so commonly usedFrankly I dont know how the guy did it being so consistently humorous without using any words  All of it depends on a story simple enough to be followed visually and on Chaplins genius for mime and situation construction  There ARE some words spoken on screen  this was his last holdout against talking pictures  but none of them involve people speaking directly to one another  There is a song at the end with gibberish lyrics And the rest of the speaking is always filtered through some mechanical medium a record player a radio a television set  Charlie was accused of communism somewhere along the line and pretty much thrown out of the country after which he lived in Switzerland  You couldnt tell he was a Commie from this movie  It comments on its time of course the Great Depression and Charlie and Paulette Goddard are two poor people  Management is shown as callus playing with a jigsaw puzzle and reading newspapers while the workers slave away on the assembly line  There is even a communist demonstration  But its all played for laughs  One of those red warning flags falls off the back of a truck passing down an empty street  Charlie picks up the flag and waves it shouting after the truck As he begins to hurry after the truck still shouting and waving a horde of dissatisfied workers silently falls in behind him and hes arrested  Poor people steal but they only steal food  If having sympathy for the unemployed is communism then roughly one American out of three was a communist because thats roughly what the unemployment rate was  Modern Times is no more communistic than say My Man Godfrey or Salt of the Earth or The Grapes of Wrath  Besides that Charlie is no classical Marxist  Marxism posited a transition from false consciousness the feeling that ones miserable poverty was due to personal failure or bad luck to class consciousness the realization that exploitation by the property owners was at fault  Charlie is no activist  He fumbles every job he gets  The other workers are hardly sympathetic  Charlies not a working class hero but a black sheep  The opening shot of the herd of sheep hurrying past the camera includes one black sheep in the middle of the flock and its hard to imagine that this was accidentalActually Charlie had lost a lot of respect in America because he had an eye for young girls  His second marriage resulted from a sixteenyearold girls faked pregnancy  Paulette Goddard who became his third wife maybe and maybe not was twenty when this movie was made and Charlie was fortythree  In any case  boy if you want to get Americans heated up just combine sex with politics  A surefire winner for the puritans  It may have cost Goddard the part of Scarlet OHara in Gone With the Wind because she may have been living in sin with Charlie at the timeI dont want to spell out too many of the gags because I dont want to spoil them but be alert for the feeding machine that goes berserk and shoves lug nuts down Charlies throat and hits him in the face with a corn cob Charlie looks as if hes strapped helplessly into his seat but his hands were free under the rotating table so that he could manipulate the fiendish devices himself  The first time I saw this movie was in the Arts Theater on Springfield Avenue in Irvington New Jersey  When Paulette Goddard first appeared the man on my right chuckled and said Now thats a goodlooking babe  On my left my marmorial ex laughed out loud during the feeding machine episode for perhaps the only time in her life  There can be no higher recommendation,0
1090,tt0027977,Usually you watch old films trying to be generous with your criticism because of the huge difficulties the directors and actors faced those days This one is a miracle A comedy that stands tall even in todays cinema starring perhaps the best comedian who lived on earth At some parts it is hilarious but the social message Chaplin wants to pass is always there making Modern Times even more important The love story is also very sweet and Paulette Goddard is a remarkably beautiful woman! So what to say about this mans genius? Charlie Chaplin acts directs and even composes the music! And by all means he does a magnificent job You can find great symbolism and a lot of political references we all have to remember that Chaplin was accused of being a communist which of course was a pride for intellectuals given their accusers I have unlimited respect for the Great Charlie Chaplin,9
1091,tt0027977,This is where I decided to have a look at Charlie Chaplin and his famous Modern times  we are all familiar with scenes in a factory but honestly there is much much more happening later and it truly surprised me that film turns into a such epic saga Another example of things I just assumed I know It charmed me instantly of course because Chaplin was a true genius and magician  his creation Little Tramp is easily understood to anybody no matter what background and we love him dearly for all his sweetness clumsiness and old heart This story apparently happens in Metropolislike factory where work machines and buttons are parodied mercilessly until we audience roar with laughter  I was honestly surprised that something filmed almost a century ago was still so fresh and funny Basically everything after the first start on the fast track was new to me and I laughed and laughed until I found myself rewinding scenes and enjoying them again What a genius!Once Little Tramp looses his job  there is a whole unspoken atmosphere of unfairness poverty and depression around  he quickly ends up in a prison from which he doesnt even want to leave However he gets Cocaine in his salt Charlie Chaplin on a Coke! saves policemen from escaped criminals meets ministers wife very funny scene and gets release from the prison with job recommendation letter And this is still just a beginning of the movie! There is much much more coming up later  it really goes on forever but its wonderful heartwarming and joyous to watch I almost forgot everything about myself and my whereabouts while I was so deeply lost in this masterpiece Film is so immensely rich with characters stories little details and magic that I honestly think its one of the best things I have ever seen,10
1092,tt0027977,The Tramp Charlie Chaplin is just a cog in the modern machinery He is unable to keep with the production line tightening bolts The owner picks him out for testing the automatic feeding machine By late afternoon he gets lost in the machinery He cant stop tightening causing great damage and they send him to a mental hospital He gets out but he doesnt have a job anymore A red flag falls off the back of a truck He picks it and a massive march starts behind him without he knowing it The police grabs him thinking that hes the leader In prison he helps thwart an escape attempt and is released A Gamin Paulette Goddard is stealing food for the children Her unemployed father is shot dead leaving her little sisters sent off to the orphanage She steals a loaf of bread and runs into the Tramp He tries to take the blame but shes caught anyways He prefers life inside and deliberately gets caught stealing They get thrown into the same wagon and escape getting thrown out togetherThis has the iconic factory scene with the Tramp in the machinery happening early on The story is slightly random as the pair has one misadventure after another as they struggle to have the American dream The Tramp is making a statement of sorts as he gets swept up from one thing to the next Hes the cog that never really fits in the machinery This is a sound movie with sound being used for specific and interesting ways The Tramp is actually singing but its a lot of nonsense This definitely has a social commentary but its still funny message movie,9
1093,tt0027977,A delightful film with one great scene after another Charlie Chaplins Modern Times is hilarious thoughtful and timeless  Chaplin combined his silent film skills with creative use of sound effects and music and added a wide variety of interesting and entertaining settings to create a film that is very pleasing to watch  Chaplins own fine acting is complemented by a delightful and charming performance by Paulette Goddard  And the story itself filled with twists and turns is a timeless commentary on modern life much of which is applicable to any eraCharlies Tramp character joins up in this one with a lively orphaned gamin Goddard to help each other through a lengthy series of setbacks and triumphs that reflect the stresses of fastpaced modern life  Most of their adventures are hilarious but many also contain serious social commentary that is still just as relevant in any age  Chaplin and Goddard make a delightful pair who win the complete sympathy of the viewer in their fight for survivalThe movie has one great scene after another from some wild sequences in a steel factory to a set of sometimes breathtaking antics in a deserted department store to the incomparable climactic sequence in a cafe and many others in between  The settings are done with great care and wit and the action makes full use of the props and possibilities at handThis is a wonderful movie that anyone who likes vintage cinema will enjoy Even those who are thoroughly jaded by the excesses of modern cinema should at least give Modern Times a try  This is one of the great masterpieces of Chaplins or any other era,0
1094,tt0031381,This film shows the best of the American cinema Whether we like the film or not one has to recognize the greatest achievement perhaps of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry Gone with the Wind represents a monumental leap as well as a departure for the movies as they were done prior to this filmThe vision of David O Selznick the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchells massive account about the South before and after the Civil War pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the warGone with the Wind brought together the best people in Hollywood The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen Of course credit must be due to the director Victor Fleming and his vision as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard who gave the right tone to the film The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movieOne cant conceive another Scarlett OHara played by no one but Vivien Leigh Her beauty her sense of timing her intelligent approach to this role makes this a hallmark performance Ms Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows Scarlett goes from riches to rags back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didnt know she possessed Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her RhettThe same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie This is a mans man Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency His love for Scarlett the woman he knows is in love with a dream speaks eloquently for itselfThe other two principals Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard give performances that are amazing to watch Ms de Havillands Melanie Hamilton is perfect Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley Mr Howards Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife while Scarlett keeps tempting himThe rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful Ms McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing This huge talent is a joy to watchComments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie but being realistic this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities such as the slavery were the norm of the land While those things are repugnant to acknowledge in the film they are kept at a minimum After all this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South Margaret Mitchell who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American historyEnjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor,10
1095,tt0031381,Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind I was well acquainted with Max Steiners theme It opened WOR TVs Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGMs rereleases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar MovieMillion Dollar Movie is gone now but Gone With the Wind book and film remain eternal In these days Margaret Mitchells southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher let alone selling film rights to the story But it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyones mind who reads the novel or sees the film And thats just about the same because I cant think of another film that remained so faithful to the textIt is said that Margaret Mitchell wrote the book with Clark Gable in mind as Rhett Butler As the sober and ever realistic but charming Rhett Gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen However in the last half hour of the film when hes hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness Gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently If Mitchell knew who she wanted as Rhett nobody knew who would be Scarlett The search for Scarlett OHara is one of those Hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of Edna May Oliver read for the part Gone With the Wind started filming without a Scarlett as the famous burning of Atlanta sequence was done first While it was being down David O Selznick settled on a fairly unknown British actress at least in the USA Vivien LeighIt was a stroke of casting genius Vivien Leighs screen output is pretty small she was primarily a stage actress Gone With the Wind is more her film than Rhett Butlers The story is her story how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living shes become accustomed to from the preCivil War era In the process she helps all those around her economically but loses all their previous affection Ive always felt the key scene in the film is after Leslie Howard tells Leigh hell be marrying Olivia DeHavilland and Leigh makes a fool of herself with him she finds out that Clark Gable has overheard the whole thing Hes fascinated by her but because of that hes on to all her ploysLeslie Howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads His Ashley Wilkes is not all that different from Alan Squire in The Petrified Forest Imagine Squire as a wealthy plantation owner and youve Ashley Hes stronger than he realizes though hes the one that reluctantly enlists in the Confederate Army while the cynical Rhett Butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runnerIve always felt however that the most difficult acting job in Gone With the Wind was the role of Melanie Hamilton Olivia DeHavilland after initially considering trying out for Scarlett decided to go after Melanie Its a deceptive part superficially its a lot like the crinoline heroines DeHavilland was doing at Warner Brothers Melanie is the counterpoint to Scarlett an incredibly kind and decent soul who cant see bad in anyone One of her best scenes is with Ona Munson who is Belle Watling the most prominent madam in Atlanta The other women of society snub her but DeHavilland accepts her help for the Confederate cause Its not about politics or slavery for Melanie her husband is at war and his cause is hersAnd DeHavillands death scene would move the Medusa to tears Its a great tribute to the playing skill of Olivia DeHavilland in that Melanie NEVER becomes a maudlin character She got her first Oscar nomination for Melanie in the Supporting Actress category but lost it to fellow cast member Hattie McDaniel as Scarletts mammyHatties a shrewd judge of character shes a slave but shes also a family confidante of the OHaras As Gable says shes one of the few people he knows whose respect he wantsOf course Gone With the Wind is from the southern point of view Growing up in Atlanta Margaret Mitchell heard reminisces from many Confederate veterans and the stories they told found their way into Gone With the Wind Its about what the white civilian population endured during the war and ReconstructionDavid O Selznick got a bit of irony in there though Please note during the burning of Atlanta the slaves who are being marched out to dig trenches are singing Let My People Go And thats just what the Union Army was coming to Atlanta to doGone With the Wind copped so many Oscars for  that Bob Hope quipped at the Academy Awards ceremony that it was a benefit for David O Selznick Of course it was the Best Picture of  and Vivien Leigh won the first of her two Best Actress AwardsMetroGoldwynMayer kept itself in the black for years by simply rereleasing Gone With the Wind Unlike any other classic film it won new generations of fans with theatrical rerelease Somewhere on this planet there are people seeing this  year old classic and it is winning new fans as I write thisAnd I think Gone With the Wind the telling of the interwoven lives of Rhett Scarlett Ashley and Melanie and the world they knew will be something viewed and read hundreds of years from now,10
1096,tt0031381,Margaret Mitchells Gone with the Wind in its true essence is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence Victor Flemings rendition of the classic novel a classic within its own right does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchells evocative masterpiece In the words of Mitchell herself Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War visàvis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survivalScarlet OHara the well bred haughty tempestuous and opportunistic protagonist of the saga is an ostensibly flawed individual whose inexorable urge to placate her ego and realize her fancies appears far stronger than her adherence to any credence pious to her people and relevant to her time Her scintillating charm and unrestrained zeal not only make her an object of desire for her male counterparts but also an object of envy for the girls around herVivian Leigh perfectly fits into the caricature of Scarlet OHara She makes full use of her talent courage and guile to portray a part that requires subtlety brusqueness and poise in equal parts It may sound like a hyperbole but no other actress seemed better equipped to play the part a southern belle than Leigh herself who won not one but two Oscars while playing one first for her portrayal of Scarlet OHara and second for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire opposite Marlon Brando In fact her portrayal of Scarlet OHara in which she perfectly blends panache poignancy and peremptoriness is arguably the greatest portrayal by a female lead in cinematic history Leigh uses her onstage experience to improvise in order to add new dimensions and complexities to Scarlets caricature which according to the novel was mostly one dimensional outandout bad Scarlets stubbornness and her impish obsession for a conformist like Ashley who is not only indifferent to her feelings but also incapable of reciprocating the passion and zeal with which she pursues him represent just one dimension of her multifaceted self which is revealed layer by layer with the progression of the narrative The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars a usurper an egomaniac a damsel a nemesis a menace a guardian a savior a patriot a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhoodClark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leighs larger than life portrayal He is an outright reprobate an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures However behind this facade just like Scarlet there is a human capable of love and worthy of being loved These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland who as Melanie is a paragon of love humility and forgiveness She provides a striking contrast to Scarlets caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhoodThe movies direction cinematography editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece one to be savored till eternity The movie is an amalgam of scenes high on emotion and drama which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout The scene in which Scarlets father tells her the importance of mother land deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for is pure gold Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy Butlers famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet You should be kissed and often and by someone who knows how also happens to be one of all time favorite The movie especially its anticlimatic ending brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergoPS Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinemas greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinemas timelessness and its limitless potential A must watch for everyone /http//wwwapotpourriofvestigescom/,10
1097,tt0031381,Ive seen the film many times have always enjoyed it But Ive been reading the book for the first time Its a very long novel and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending Its a good read but Margaret Mitchell former newspaper reporter is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it Its the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick Not what parts to film but which parts to leave out So many characters that appeared in the book couldnt be introduced in the movie without extending the films length to well over four hours So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed Selznick was close to running out of money so he asked his angel millionaire Jock Whitney to loan him enough to finish the film The film was finally completed and edited then was testmarketed at a theatre not far from LA The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards which allowed Selznick to rest easy knowing he had a hit on his hands,9
1098,tt0031381,The setting is a Georgia plantation The year is  and sixteenyearold Scarlett OHara is infatuated with the blond drowsyeyed Ashley Wilkes  the problem is Ashley plans to marry another woman Little matter that every other man in the county is courting Scarlett and that a charming scoundrel named Rhett Butler is staring at her with questionable intent  she cares only for AshleySuddenly the Civil War brakes out changing the fates and fortunes of all Scarlett clever manipulative and charming proves an adept survivor  but what will she have to do to survive? And will she ever learn whom it is that she really loves?GWTW is one of the most meticulously cast films ever; with the possible exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley in his forties rather old to be playing a man half that age every role was perfectly assigned After you watch Vivien Leigh you will be unable to imagine anyone else playing Scarlett and Hattie McDaniels strong unforgettable performance as Mammy netted her an academy award the first for an AfricanAmerican actor,10
1099,tt0031381,It is always in peoples nature to put down great things and to nitpick or sometimes just be plain mean No matter what anyone says this is utterly fantastic in story in special effects in casting with perhaps the sad exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley and in captivation Vivien Leigh is so powerful passionate magnificent and beautiful that you could watch it  times on that ground alone She brings something so convincing and human to the role of the selfish spoilt Scarlett; the character is larger than lifeLeaving Viviens astounding performance aside this remains a sweeping unrivalled epic Watch it Esthers rating /,8
1100,tt0031381,I believe that when one views a film one should consider the context in which it was madeBarely  years after talking pictures were first created; less than that after the first fulllength color feature film was created; near the end of the greatest depression this country ever experienced and in which pretty much the only entertainment available to most was radio or the movies; David O Selznik decided to turn the biggest potboiler blockbuster novel into a movieAnd what a movie Stunning color the most popular mail actor of his time perfect music score incredible action scenes story line only  years removed from when it happened and on and on Can you imagine what a storeclerk or a farmer or a teacher experienced in that world seeing Gone With the Wind? What was there to compare with?  was a watershed year for great movies and this one was the greatest produced Try watching this movie as if there were no TV no DVDs only a few radio stations spending maybe the second to the last quarter you owned never having seen such a movie before and you get what I mean Masterful for its time and still timeless today,10

1105,tt0031381,For some nostalgic dreamers Gone With the Wind is a glorious swan song depicting the fall of the South during a devastating Civil War and its reconstruction on the ashes of the Old Order a Civilization forever gone with the wind Its the adaptation of Margaret Mitchells epic tale written in bold letters with this peculiar ability to portray the Yankees as the bad guys so common in the stories related by Southerners as they invite us to understand their idealism if not to root for it a vision of Gallantry and Old European Nobility where women were courted wives were submissive to their husbands and slaves treated with paternalismBut for some idealistic spirits Gone With the Wind resonates as one of the most heartbreaking pages of American History when the North fought the South in the name of Liberty Freedom and Justice and when History written by the victorious side ultimately showed the Confederate as the ones who were wrong Gone With the Wind chronicles what the South used to be a world where coexisted two cultures the Whites and the Colored And the depiction of the slaves oscillates between the high pitched voice of the simpleminded Prissy Butterfly McQueen who knew nothing about birthin babies and the wisdom and authority of Mammy Hattie McDaniel in her Oscarwinning role two figures two extremes so rooted in our hearts its impossible to dislike them despite the obvious stereotypesFor literate minds History is only the setting while the film is an incredible achievement in storytelling inviting us to follow a gallery of magnificent and appealing characters during a slice of life where the passing of time can be felt when History affects story with mercy or ruthlessness sometimes tragic sometimes ironic Its a narrative whose emotional core is the heroine Scarlett OHara Vivien Leigh whose heart belongs to the charming blonde Ashley Wilkes Leslie Howard married to the gentle and extremely goodhearted cousin Melanie Hamilton Olivia de Havilland A triangular love that sets the personality of Scarlett as a remarkable antiheroine selfish greedy jealous but so brave courageous and generous when the circumstances of War forever changed the face of the South A great soul that could only be revealed by a great opportunity a pivotal metamorphosis incarnated by the iconic As God is my witness Ill never be hungry againThe fascinating aspect of Scarletts personality is that her flaws elevated her above all the other characters she doesnt care for etiquette for traditions her spirit is free her ego is big and her heart so vulnerable While the South is definitely turned to the past Scarlett thinks of the future as she says after all tomorrow is another day Scarlett is a modern figure and thats what makes her so appealing both in the film and to the audience And Rhett Butler Clark Gable in his most defining role as the visitor from Charleston is Scarlets perfect match Both dont belong to that era they think of money greed prosperity and passion They embody all the values that America would stand for transcending the oldfashioned setting of the South But like the Souths enthusiasm for War the same pride that drives their passion would ruin their relationshipsFor many passionate hearts this is one of the most intense romances ever adapted to the big screen a frustrating and seemingly impossible love between two strongminded egos two faces staring at each other as if they were at the verge of an irresistible passion or about to fight each other As Scarlett was visibly jealous of Melanie when she went to bed with Ashley the movie makes you penetrate the soul of these characters with such intensity you could feel she wished that Melanie could die A childish and immature attitude probably shared with Butler who wouldnt have minded if Ashley could die in the War too The love between Rhett and Scarlett is made of the same idealism that built the South myth a lost but so endearing cause a fire that burnt inside and made pretty fitting that the most intimate and sensual moment they had was under the orange sky during Atlantas big fire Love has never been as passionate as a loveandhate relationship and never seemed a romance so comparable to a lost cause mirroring the Southerners very faith in victory Rhetts last stand when he takes Scarlett up the stairs in the one night she wouldnt turn him out is the perfect illustration of a love that pumped its energy from hate and anger As Scarlett lost in her love for Ashley will never realize that her man is Rhett and when she does Rhett is already fed up and finally delivers the most unforgettable comeuppance ever Frankly my dear I dont give a damn before disappearing in a foggy mist Scarlett gets a magnificent lesson about life and wouldnt have been as likable without this last slap in the face This I dont give a damn voted # in the American Film Institutes Top  Movie quotes was Rhetts revenge and he sure deserved it and many wannabeScarlett would admit that tooBut while Gone With the Wind deals with lost causes its more than anything the triumph of Cinema as the most defining Art of the last century Echoing the novels status as a best seller its one of the greatest films of all time the greatest casting ever the greatest score and the greatest challenge for superlatives Victor Flemings superproduction that would become a landmark in filmmaking with its unique visual style and beautiful cinematography in colors forever incarnated by Scarletts shadowy silhouette standing beside a tree during a beautiful sunset Along with The Wizard of Oz and Mr Smith Goes to Washington Gone With the Wind is probably Hollywoods Golden Age reaching its pinnacle before the War would come in  ,10

1107,tt0031381,Gone With the Wind is without a doubt one of the most magnificent romances ever A realistic fiction that ends abruptly and leaves its viewer/reader starving for more but unfortunately never produced a sequel A book was written in the s that continued the story but trust me it sucked Scarlett was such a complex character selfish spirited passionate about everything she wants But in the end you see that Scarlett changes she learns about communication and respect for all those who love her after she lost everyone who did Never read the sequel if you read the first one because it isnt a Margaret Mitchell novel and therefor you wont SEE the complexity Those of you who voted for this movie to have one star I pity you You cannot see the complexity or beauty of this wonderful tale or you just didnt see it and decided to vote for a movie you thought would be stupid when in fact it is the most popular civil war movie in history Please support this movie and give it FAIR votes It won ten Oscars and has claim to one of the most amazing casts ever so take that into consideration plus the effort it took when you give this movie a one/ten It deserves so much more,10
1108,tt0031381,There has never been any movie in the cinema history that was more a legend than Gone with the wind It is undeniable that this movie contains lots of goofs but despite all this it is a blockbuster and a real masterpiece Completely NOT overratedI love this movie I cant explain why exactly There are sooo many reasons I first saw it when I was a little kid and still cant forget it Its so special if you can return to movie even when you had seen it more than  times And GWTW is this kind of a movieIn my opinion a movie can not be a good when the acting is not good And there acting is great! Every character is portrayed so magnificently!I will start with the supporting players Barbara ONeil though only  while filming played mother of quite adult daughters She was the Ellen Robillard Mitchell descirbed in her book so stative so smart so lady Thomas Mitchell should have received Oscar for his Gerald OHara portroyal and I think he did not just because he won for Stagecoach that year Scarletts sisters are really well cast But the best supporting performance of the film is this one of Hattie McDaniels She is simply magnificent moving and unforgettable as Mummy Just amazingMany people claim that Leslie Howard did not fit the role of Ashley They may be right in some sense but lets think it over twice Ashley was more handsome as Mitchell described him but he was a dreamer who could not find himself in a new cruel world And Howard showed this quality as best as possibleOf course Olivia de Havillands performance of Melanie was as worth of Oscar as Hattie McDaniels but later on she was given what she deserved Oscars for To each his own and The Heiress She plays Melanie with such a sensibility but she manages to show her hidden strength but not in a dominate way Clark Gable was so unsure of his talent till the end of his life I think that he was a great actor Hes so real as Rhett and he has to play several dramatic scenes And he does it perfectlyremember that playing those scenes like those after Scarletts miscarriage needed acting talent Hes perfect But I wont hide my opinion that Vivien Leighs Scarlett is the best and most powerful point of the whole movie Vivien won the role when she was completely unknown She managed to master the Southern accent as well She did not play Scarlett She WAS Scarlett But only in this movie She never acted any other character the same way She is terrific and has all those features that original Mitchells Scarlett possesses I heard that she wanted to play the part exactly as Mitchell created it and Fleming wanted her to play it just as a bitch so they fought about it badly but finally Vivien did a great work and her Oscar was something very obviousIf you love good cinema if you want to see something moving and something that is not getting old though almost ! do not miss it,10
1109,tt0031381,Gone with the Wind is one of the greatest American classics ever made It tells the story of Scarlett OHara played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh She is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still care for her She is in love with Ashley Wilkes Leslie Howard but he marries to Melanie Hamilton She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance A new man in Scarletts life is Rhett Butler Clark Gable but Scarlett does everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and her own benefit Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart mainly because they are much the same They both think the world is there for them Melanie and Scarlett become friendsThe movie is set in the time of the Civil War What happens exactly with Scarlett Rhett Ashley and Melanie is for you to see but the war is pretty important for the story and the way it is used is great The story itself is great anyway Although the movie is long it is never boring A reason for that is the performances I already mentioned Olivia de Havilland Clark Gable is very good charming and sometimes funny Hattie McDaniel as the black made is outstanding but I have to say that the best thing in this movie is Vivien Leigh To make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do but she makes it seem so easy It is one of the strongest performances I have seenBesides the story and the acting we have the music the sets the costumes the cinematography and of course the direction It is all great It was made in  and over  years later it still is a very impressive movie,10
1110,tt0031381,I watched this movie for the first time at fourteen years old I enjoyed it immensely I have always been a fanatic for anything Civil War themed so when my mother recommended it to me it was a yes from the start The opening scenes show the young Scarlett OHara as she awaits her fathers arrival Beloved in the eyes of all the men in the county Scarlett has acquired a high selfesteem but when the War is announced to come after all the highspirited Scarlett soon faces obstacles that are determined to destroy her faith and her hope She meets many people along the way she even gets married With new relationships new responsibilities come as well Rhett Butler a man determined to have Scarlett for his own comes into her life half way through both the novel and the movie and he fights her on topics such as love politics and societal roles Even after the Civil War Scarlett is still faced with many decisions She has faced death marriage and defeat many times Still willing to go on even when it seemed impossible Scarlett leaves us with the last quote of the novel and book After all tomorrow is another day,10
1111,tt0031381,If you have ever considered GWTW to be less than a masterpiece youll be swayed by the th Anniversary Edition DVD The disc set features the remastered film and more extras than you could possibly watch in one day after watching the film of course The twohour makingof documentary is fascinating and shows how the producer David O Selznick of the film affected the cast directors and writers  and shows the publicity frenzy that was the hunt for Scarlett The feature of Olivia De Havilland in  discussing her role as Melanie is a real treat The picture and sound are great on the th Anniversary DVD and the special features are a true treasure Accept no substitutes seek out the th Anniversary DVD and bring it home,10
1112,tt0031381,Here is how I feel about Gone With the Wind My moms side of the family is Southern They lived mostly around where Scarlett and her gang hung out Some had plantations and owned slaves My grandparents were old fashioned in the clueless way Margaret Mitchell was Ive heard their side lots of times and I found it to be wrong If I were Black I wouldnt like to pass by statues erected to past oppressors either nor would I want to have flags in my face constantly reminding me of a sorrowful pastHowever please consider this If youre going to get upset at GWTW and ban showing it then you would also want to eliminate the rest of the movies from back then which show stereotypes as well correct? Unfortunately ALMOST ALL probably about  of Black roles for the stage and screen pres were just as racist as in GWTW many were worseThe problem is if you get rid of these movies you erase the work of any Black actors back then as well You wont see why Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar for a performance in a land so bigoted she could not sit in the audience during the premiere You wont see lots of superb singing dancing and acting by any AfricanAmerican during this time They will be completely ignored because of the contextYou wind up punishing all these people who wanted to work in entertainment and had little influence over the roles they played as well as those whites who made those moviesAnd Hollywood whitewashes and pretties up EVERYTHING It always has Dont get upset because they did it for the millionth time in GWTWConsider the movie  about ancient Sparta There was no mention of slaves they owned or the organized pedophilia that went into the training of boys Google it if you dont know what Im talking aboutAnd yet there were no mass protests at the rose colored vision in the movie No one came to picket the film because it omitted a horrendous flaw in Spartan societyWhy? Well for one thing that was well over  years ago What happened in Sparta is no longer directly relevant to anyone No normal modern army expects raping young boys as part of their trainingIts no longer relevantUnfortunately GWTW IS STILL RELEVANT Many of the problems portrayed in this film and any film from back then with Black actors are still haunting the US Denying that there is anything wrong and everything is just fine and has been fixed is simply denying realityWhy do I care? Unfortunately GWTW is one of my favorite books and films It has a strong still unique story of feminism I can relate to That is what is relevant to me in the film I have tended in the past to brush aside the slave part because it seems surreal to me to own people Im certainly not sitting there hoping the good ol days can come back I like the modern world with its aim of acceptance and tolerance I get the feeling the vast majority of viewers feel the same wayHow do we solve this problem? When Blacks are truly integrated and that day will come then GWTW will no longer be that relevant It wont strike any raw nerves The protests will die down just as they have for every other hot button issue whos time has come and goneTrue classics never die GWTW has many redeeming features which have made it endlessly entertaining to me and thousands of other people Keep talking about it show the movie now and then with perhaps a short lecture on history and context before and know that in time the pain will fadeALSO KEEP IN MIND when you criticize Scarlett for her actions there was NO OTHER WAY to survive in the Victorian world if you were a woman other than SEDUCING A MAN Its not like she could go off to college and get a degree Women were NOT allowed to own land have a bank accountvote hold a job besides perhaps a hat maker or much more commonly a prostitute etc If she seems strange for marrying men she didnt lovekeep in mind it was that or be totally broke and homelessMuch of the criticism of her character comes from total lack of knowledge about this contextAs for the movie itself I first saw it when I was thirteen It made quite an impression Forty years or so later it still moves me Some people criticize the main character Scarlett because shes not nice Shes not typical of a main female characterScarlett behaves in an uncomfortably realistic way Shes not a nice lady she is a superrare female antihero Shes not comfortingly evil but shes never going to be a goody two shoes Some people dont know how to handle thatMelanie on the other hand is criticized for being unrealistic I would ask anyone who thinks that to understand the context of the times she lived in There was no mass media save for the local newspaper and that was hardly an international trove of information as they are now No TV no radio no internet A person could grow up to be innocent in a way we simply dont experience in modern societyIts a movie about survival And its a war movie without battle scenes I would urge you to watch it,10
1113,tt0031381,Im sorry I generally dont like this film Expansive epic picturesque an achievement for its time  OK A compelling story about the devastation hardship suffering and brutality of the Civil War and the courage and resilience of its survivors  OK but credit the novel for all thatA key problem is the heroine Scarlett OHara who remains insufferably selfish and inhumane throughout this long movie Are we supposed to admire her? I cannot Another problem is that the film drags in many places Too much screen time is focused on men professing love for Scarlett and Scarlett expressing her hopeless adoration for Ashley Gosh move on with it! Even for its time I cant see how its flaws failed to overcome its grandeur,6
1114,tt0031381,I first saw Gone with the Wind in its initial commercial TV broadcast in  I have since seen the film numerous times via a succession of home video media videotape laserdisc and DVD Yet seeing the film once more on bluray and a large widescreen high def monitor is like seeing it completely anew The sweeping cinematography of this classic epic film has never before been delivered to home audiences in such stunning power and detail The achingly romantic score has never sounded better whether heard in original mono or reconstructed stereo Rhett Butler Clark Gable has never looked more rakishly handsome nor Scarlett OHara Vivien Leigh more alluringly sensual In short for anyone not having seen Gone with the Wind in glorious bigscreen Technicolor almost all film viewers under the age of  the recent bluray release is a mustsee revelationBeyond the compelling audiovisual experience Gone with the Wind thankfully retains its fascination as a central piece of American popular culture  a work of art complex and rich enough not only to bear up under multiple viewings but to reveal like great literature different aspects of its meaning depending on the cultural and personal variables that a viewer brings to the experience There were certainly a great number of impressions in my recent viewing that I dont remember having in quite the same way   or even  years agoFor one thing characters and character relationships impacted me much differently than in the past Scarletts multiple marriages and affairs – even the protracted love/hate odyssey with Rhett – seemed less interesting now than the strength of character that enables her physical survival and success as a business woman In many ways Scarlett is clearly not an ante and postbellum Southern belle but a woman of the s newly emerging from a patriarchal culture and acquiring a social role and status equivalent to a malesAs with other s films that touch upon the redefinition of female roles Scarletts acquisition of masculine power is greeted with ambivalence or downright hostility Even Rhett who is generally bemused by and attracted to Scarletts unbridled selfinterested power grabs eventually tries to tame and dominate Scarlett via marriage On one occasion he tries to persuade her to give up the lumber mill and become a more devoted mother to Bonnie Blue On another he compares the heartless Scarlett unfavorably to Belle Watling another hardheaded businesswoman but one whose ancient profession is considerably less threatening Ultimately Rhett attempts to assert his masculine power by an act of sexual aggression for which he would today be subject to domestic rape charges Amazingly given the era in which the film was made nothing works for long Scarlett is indomitable and irrepressible Unlike other s heroines Scarlett is NEVER reduced to a subordinate role In the end Tara and the screen are hers and hers aloneAnother thing that struck me in my latest viewing of Gone with the Wind was how much its creators particularly David O Selznick strove to temper the racist content of the story materials Of course they were unsuccessful from todays perspective but when the film is compared to Birth of a Nation the original film epic of the Souths secession and destruction one can clearly see its progressive designs First of all glorification of the Souths rebellion is tempered from the outset by the dissenting voices of such otherwise dissimilar characters as Rhett and Ashley both of whom foresee that the South has written its own ticket to destruction by entering into a war it cannot possibly win and for an historically dubious cause Notably the two central male characters view slavery askance Rhett is never a slaveholding gentleman And Ashley who is the scion of slaveholders reveals plans to free the Wilkes slaves upon the death of his father Moreover the slaves on the Tara plantation while still subject to stereotypical treatment are far more prominent and rounded as characters than in any previous American film intended principally for white audiences This is particularly true of sagelike Mammy of course but not only of herThe stark differences between the Mitchell/Selznick version of Civil War history and DW Griffiths can be seen most clearly in the postwar Reconstruction period In Gone with the Wind the really ugly stereotypes of empowered blacks are absent with the negative focus centering instead on white carpetbaggers Even the threats to Scarletts Southern Womanhood come not from renegade blacks but first from a white Northern deserter and later from white scalawags in Shantytown a locale that Scarlett intrepidly if foolishly ventures through From this latter threat she is pointedly rescued not by chivalrous whites but by her former slave Sam who beats off the wouldbe rapists and drives Scarlett safely home What a far cry this is from Birth of a Nation where Little Sister throws herself from a cliff rather than be raped by a former slave who has stalked her through perilous woodsAbove all Gone with the Wind deliberately avoids all mention of the Ku Klux Klan the terminally embarrassing heroes of Birth of a Nation The only scene that comes close to a Klan allusion occurs following the attempted assault on Scarlett when Ashley Dr Meade and thenhusband Mr Kennedy set about clandestinely to clean out the scalawags Yet even then their targets are not primarily black nor do the avengers don robes The audience is not even permitted to witness the attack – only Ashleys wounds from itIf Americans in the st century can still respond to Gone With the Wind  and clearly they can  it is not only because of its grand pictorial displays and epic action but because in terms of gender and race this classic of Hollywoods  peak year looks forward to a modern tomorrow as much as if not more than it laments a tragically flawed American past,9
1115,tt0031381,I was dating at the time this came out in a small theater on Hollywood blvd for a short run Me and my girlfriend decided to see a movie and chose this one not knowing anything about it We sat in the balcony and was immediately captured by the music characters storyline and each other as we watched what we thought was a memorable night out together Unknown to me when part one ended I thought the movie was over and remarked boy that was good but I wonder what happened after that We got up to go and found out it was only intermission I cannot describe the feelings of joy knowing there was more We were not disappointed either When it ended I felt totally satisfied and changed forever more A great movie with my future wife locked into each other for our lifetime Since then I have seen this movie so many times never tiring of it I bought the collectors sets vhs and finally the DVD Just finished watching it again loving every moment until the end Will I see it again? Why not after all tomorrow is another dayGood movie to eat with while watching,10
1116,tt0031381,I love this film I have seen it a handful of times and even though I am always a little frustrated by the stubborn pride of the two main characters I can never dislike it True Scarlet OHara is a foolish woman who believes she is madly in love with someone elses husband but she is just as bad as the proud Rhett Butler who loves her through it all Their problem is admitting their true feelings deep down and in this small selfish act is where we find the heart of the story and its timelessness We all love that great timeless love story despite its tragic ending and Scarlets tenacity for surviving and keeping her family alive even if it did involve tricks and schemes on her part Despite all this the film managed to capture the heart of Americans everywhere and even those hearts of the generations that followed That is the true power of this film Aside from being able to enchant its audiences Gone With The Wind was truly a groundbreaking film in American Cinema It was one of the first major films that came out in vividly welldone color not only that but the photography was phenomenal also Much more can be said about this film but for now all I will say is this Fantastic film worth the  hours,10
1117,tt0031381,I waited  year before even considering watching Gone With The Wind Four plus hours long? ? It was as old as my Dad But finally in a desire to see all these classic movies I sat down to watch itsince then and before writing this review I have now seen it three times Gone With The Wind is quite simply breath taking It is brilliant and captivating and perhaps one of the greatest epics you will ever lay eyes on Some people consider Gone With The Wind to be the greatest film ever made and its pretty easy to see why Especially if you factor in the time period this was made the special effects the sheer grandeur of it is impressive NOW let alone  years ago The raging war the fields being worked the attacks being carried out the people evacuating and the beauty and horror of the south during the civil war Add onto that this incredible unmatched chemistry between the romantic leads and youve got one incredible epic that defined epic before it even existedVivien Leigh is Scarlett OHara One of the most influential and recognizable characters in movie historyprobably top  Leighs Scarlett will remain in your memory forever Her character goes through so many changes and at times you literally despise hershes whiny and needy and mousy and then in the next breath you see this incredible strength and wisdom and this ability to make her such a hero Shes a strong female lead and her performance is amazing Scarlett OHara is one of the greatest characters in movie history Clark Gable as the irrepressible Captain Rhett Butler At first I thought Gables performance lacked depth I thought he came across as a movie star there to show off his stuff but then as the film progressed I began to see what Captain Butler was all about Rhett Butler had this air of overconfidence a macho party man with nothing holding him down including political ties His reputation as a drunkard and a rich bachelor suited him fine Then Scarlett comes into his life and he falls hopelessly in love with the most unlikely girl that plagues him for the years and years Gable is a master and looks incredible on screen and shows why men of his era were leading men the likes of which weve never known He definitely deserved his Oscar Nomination for the role The supporting cast is so huge I could go into detail on every single one of them They all do an incredible job including the first African American actor to be nominated for an Academy Award Hattie McDaniel who is just wonderful as Mammy their beloved house servant Leslie Howard as Scarletts love interest for years and years Ashley Wilkes Olivia de Havilland was one of my favorite supporting roles as the loving and kind Melanie Wilkes who marries Ashley away from Scarlett She was terrific in her role one of the best characters in the film Harry Davenport Thomas Mitchell Barbara ONeil Butterfly McQueenso so so many other terrific performances in this film Also watch for uncredited and small roles by future stars George Reeves Superman and Richard Farnsworth The Straight Story/Anne of Green Gables For years I havent been a fan of old classics Just now am I getting around to watching them but if youre the same way put that aside and see Gone With The Wind Its LONG there is no doubt about it but its utter brilliance story action romance and just everything about it will keep you absolutely riveted I now completely understand why people consider this one of the greatest films ever made if not THEE greatest I dont know if I can say that exactly because I have my own list of favorites for different reasons but I will say Gone With The Wind is perhaps the exact definition of a classic and worthwhile from beginning to end One of the greatest films I have ever seen and I will be sure to add this to the list of movies I watch again and again /,10
1118,tt0031381,Over the weekend I was given the opportunity to see Gone With The Wind in theaters with my parents for its th anniversary Its kind of embarrassing to me that I a selfprofessed lover and at this point addict of cinema hadnt yet seen a movie that is universally considered one of if not THE best American movie ever made Part of me had always been turned off by its  hour runtime as I am in college and dont often have the time to sit down and watch a movie in a single hour sitting But another part of me had shied away from Gone due to all the blatant racism in it that I had been warned of I had wasted my time watching DW Griffiths epic The Birth of a Nation and did not want to sit through another slog of a film that is great technically but ruined by its subtext So when I sat down in the theater I was hesitant but excited And yes Gone With The Wind is undoubtedly racist but it is also so much more and the fact that it can be both great while having all of its apparent flaws is the very reason why it is undoubtedly a classic,10
1119,tt0012349,While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplins later features The Kid is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicelyWhile its a fairly simple story this is one of Chaplins most efficiently designed movies  Every scene either is necessary to the plot or is very funny for its own sake or both  Except for Chaplin and Coogan most of the other characters even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance are just there to advance the plot when needed and the two leads are allowed to carry the show which they both do extremely wellThe Kid is also impressive in that while the story is a sentimental one it strikes an ideal balance maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies  Here the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorableThis is one of Chaplins very best movies by any measure  If you enjoy silent comedies dont miss it,0
1120,tt0012349,Ive always thought theres a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies even unsentimental ones like Keatons The General or Laurel and Hardys Way Out West The latter comedy has a scene where L&amp;H perform a softshoe dance; it always brings me to tears Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that Im laughing doesnt dilute the emotional chargeOne of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already Why not marry the two things? Thats what he did in some of his early short films and thats what he does in this feature comedy The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie Jackie Coogan away Meanwhile the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesnt know if shell ever find out what became of himJackie Coogan about five in this film with his charming manners his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy is one of the alltime great child actors Want more evidence of Chaplins genius? Coogan doesnt steal the film from him This is true even though Chaplin as producer star and director makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boys talents Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles like My Boy and Oliver TwistChaplins storytelling—even with the foolish subDickensian plot twists such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed The windowbreaking scene the flophouse scene the dream sequence the tryingtogetridofthebaby scene—theyre perfect Chaplins celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselvesWant me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know I cant even complain about that Its too sweetly naïve And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the very few flawsOne important note children love this movie Show it to them while theyre young and youll make Chaplin fans of them And thats better than their becoming fans of almost anything thats being peddled to them,0
1121,tt0012349,Wow is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so That fact that it still entertains over  years after it was made is quite a testimony It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama Charlie Chaplins unique humor combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember Chaplins humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stuntsThe kid  Jackie Coogan  is just as memorable maybe even more so He is unbelievably cute especially in those oldtime clothes he wore Watching the expressions on his face even as a baby are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent eraSo between Chaplin and Coogan and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next its an amazing piece of work This is a very fastpaced story which lasts less than an hourThe special edition twodisc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear actually astounding for its age Excellent entertainment,9
1122,tt0012349,THE KID First National Pictures  a comedydrama written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  plays an important part his screen career Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIES PUNCTURED ROMANCE  a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies but releases coming once every two to three years A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in  eventually under the supervision and direction of himself Chaplins methods in movie making improved with each passing film Like himself Jackie Coogan Chaplins littlest costar and title character made such an impression with his initial performance nearly upstaging his impresario that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own becoming Hollywoods first important child starTHE KID starts off with intertitles A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear followed by The woman whose sin was motherhood titles much to the liking of a DW Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish yet in fact might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplins whose very name personifies comedy A young girl Edna Purviance leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father Carl Miller a young artist never returns to her life The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away Crooks enter the scene stealing the car discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else but after stumbling upon a note which reads Please love and care for this orphan child he decides to raise the child himself Five years pass The kid whose name is believed to be John now Charlies adopted son and sidekick start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money As for the kids mother shes become a star of great prominence devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts where lives the kid The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions unaware of each others identities When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention a middleaged country doctor having discovered Charlie not the boys true father sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child awayTHE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product especially for a silent movie made so long ago Chaplin who constructs his gags to perfection has one difficult scene that comes off naturally this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as hes lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot a substitute for a baby bottle back into his mouth Another classic moment on a serious nature is when Charlie is being held back by authorities being forced to watch his crying son taken away from him Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as hes being chased by a policeman from the slanted rooftops The closeup where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on filmChaplin and little Jackie billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin right down to his baggy pants Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances is so convincing that it doesnt take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp From this point onward he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor at the same time adding more plot pathos and truly great comedy routinesAs much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that followsTHE KID which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years was resurrected in the s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in  It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in  as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection double billed along with a comedy short THE IDLE CLASS  In the DVD format the two disc set includes rare outtakes and deleted scenes Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library where it made its debut December   during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights hosted by Robert Osborne and later in March  when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its Star of the MonthFor its age THE KID holds up extremely well thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan Theres no doubt Jackie Coogan  became an overnight star with this one film He was a natural While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again on screen anyway without them there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID ****,10
1123,tt0012349,The Kid is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplins oeuvre Chaplin hadnt filled a film so fully with pathos since The Vagabond  and then it was in a very limited way subject to the confines of tworeel length Additionally Sunnyside  was a failure The feature length of The Kid also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags pranks and set pieces and with the support of Jackie Coogan its one of his funniest comediesThe parentchild relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment and for me not many have neared Chaplin in exploiting that formula in The Kid The sequence where they take the kid for a workhouse away from the tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the filmor of all film In addition to Chaplin and Coogan Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture Furthermore Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totherohs photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist but the musical score added to the  release composed by Chaplin taken from Tchaikovsky gives the sentimental parts its most verveOf the slapstick one of my favorite scenes involves the tramp in fear of a bully Its reminiscent of his Mutual short Easy Street  which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film Yet The Kid is much more than that which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplins previous work This was the beginning of the tramp as the sympathetic pitiful hero as well as clown thats so recognizable and beloved to this dayMoreover the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect Its also funny in a silly way Its somewhat analogous to the outer reality story although with much ambiguity I wasnt always sure Chaplin was making any clear point such as with the Christ image earlier in the film but that seems unimportant; The Kid affects the emotions and isnt especially aimed at engaging the mind At six reels with more sets and a developed plot this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplins previous films; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth thus making The Kid Chaplins first complete feature,9
1124,tt0012349,It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as The Kid It is a silent movie but so rich winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words Chaplin and year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness And I really never cry in movies And the musicits simply Oscarlevel! The movie is sympathetic full of feeling touchingly funny moments It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over  years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age don´t miss it,10
1125,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous His character the Tramp is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early th century but something all of us can overcomeIn one of his first roles with this character he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family Taking himself and this very talented young boy Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote directed starred in and composed the score for this filmHere Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own He hasnt got much but he does have love which is more than can be said for the childs motherFlash forward five years and now the mother wants her son back Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion Even so the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks things not used much at the time in the movies Using these little tricks and ideas Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the storyHowever at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh sometimes in the same scene This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it,8
1126,tt0012349,Is there a way to name the greatest filmmaker of all time? Probably not to different people its gonna be different person so I can speak only for myself Let me try to describe my favorite contestant for this award,0
1127,tt0012349,Its easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius but Ill say it once again the man was a genius if only at doing a certain particular kind of film You wouldnt ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film or at least one like out of Germany or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the s and s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and the usual kickedaround word manipulated amid the comedic setups Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the KidAs it stands even at  minutes which was trimmed by Chaplin himself  years after its original release and including a new musical score its just about a perfectly told tale It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that Dreamland sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful lightanddark examination of all the major characters in the picture now with angel wings and devil horns! What its about in complete basics is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she wont be able to take care of him and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at and the Tramp decides to take care of him he even names him in one amusing aside John Then it cuts to  years later and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows eat lots of pancake and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an Older Brother of a kid John gets in a fight with Meanwhile the mother is now a success not knowing her child is somewhere right in front of her noseThis may sound like a bit of story but its told briskly and without a missed beat in editing and Chaplins reedit tightens it to a point where were mostly with the Kid and the Tramp Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be playful absurd cute and bittersweet to a degree We know this cant exactly last but the moment the poor maybesick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic and yet partially triumphant sequences in the movies Its in a case like this where we as the audience tear up more or less as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out and then intercut with Chaplins daring dash across the rooftops to save him that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film silent or otherwise; that its silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true even a beat with the Kid playing with toys an obviously cute bit is great and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like ChaplinFeaturing some excellent setpieces just unto themselves aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that bellylaugh part with the repetitive brickhit to the head or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin and excellent performances from all supporting cast including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance its altogether an aweinspiring feat To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness,10
1128,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid the cute little Jackie Coogan has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos and true to what you would expect of his best work does it superbly  The tramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding a little boy to the mix was the finishing touch  Look out too for little Lita Grey in the angel sequence who would become Chaplins nd wife four years after this film was made,0
1129,tt0012349,What makes a feature film different to a short? It isnt just length After all some of Charlie Chaplins later shorts were as long as fortyfive minutes while The Kid is barely an hour No when Chaplin made his graduation to fulllength features he also strove to broaden the scope scale and above all the dignity of his work The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplins careerThe Kid begins with a bit of backstory as a few of Chaplins shorts do but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this Here we have the opening of a drama and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief Of course such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short but here that wouldnt be appropriate Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laughoutloud funny but they certainly dont belong in a straight dramatic setting And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room sceneAnd never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration but still very natural by the standards of the time And of course little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive his movements expressions and timings all spoton so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness and he appears more like a human cartoon character Coogan steals the picture with ease and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously asideThis too is an important difference with The Kid Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act famously severing his partnership with the funnyinhisownright Ben Turpin back in  Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own The few examples such as the routine with the policemans wife and the window ledge are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material However he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this outToday The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful featurelength spinoff If you look at something like the minute Christmas special of The Office it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode Chaplins full length features however were far more than just spinoffs and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work,9
1130,tt0012349,The Kid became a critically hailed international hit A tramp Charles Chaplin brings up an abandoned baby Jackie Coogan and later loses him to his mother Edna Purviance; but there is a happy endingThe film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums The comedy is sparingly laid on but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest The production is comparatively smooth young Coogan is sensational and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced His inspiration it is suggested was the death of his own first son Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in ,10
1131,tt0012349,Charlie Chaplins first full length feature film and his biggest success up to that date is a remarkably heartwarming story  which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy It begins with a woman whos sin was motherhood who gives birth to a baby she cant support at a Charity Hospital which is kept padlocked from the inside She is forced to abandon it in an alley and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film as he is casually strolling by and then through a series of odd but entirely believable situations he is unable to get rid of it It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin who was in top form playing the little boy at  years old Charlies life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplins traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed dramatic story The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments sometimes simultaneously if you can believe that but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival and it is never once predictable all the way until the last frameThere is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy and in between rounds  Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well and giving him hints for the rest of the fight Meanwhile the other kids brother shows up a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankensteins monster than anything else What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street This is a slapstick setup that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time were it not for its direct relevance to the storyAt another point there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home as the  version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackies arms I think this is the only time in any film that Ive ever seen genuine lowbrow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident This combination not just here but throughout the film is The Kids biggest achievement There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about although my understanding is that volumes have been written about its symbolic meaning both within the movie and in reference to Chaplins personal life And speaking of which supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing I dont know which story to believe that it was because of Chaplins painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary I would bet its a little of both but the film is here and I guess ultimately thats all that matters In the five or six times that Ive seen The Kid I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramps real son either on screen or off Then again I am looking at it with st century eyes Some of Shirley Temples early films are also a little disturbing to me although for not quite the same reasons By this time Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films and after  short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond along with a few assorted others Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema,10

1133,tt0012349,The simple lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch Id say that it is as much funny as sad and the music score couldnt be more accuratePerhaps the most delightful surprise was to In the dreamland scene So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated the scene made me question myself if at the moment I was watching Buñuel and not Chaplin It is not my Chaplins favorite but its for sure one of his bests Totally recommend to be watched Chaplin will never disappoint you thats for sure If you watch this one also with City Lights and Modern Times youll be ready to enjoy his talkies The Great Dictator a classic and the perfect touching till tears Limelight,9
1134,tt0012349,Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five yearsIn reading Charlie Chaplins memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him The second thing was Chaplins determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be doneThe success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they dont totally steal the film from youThe Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid Hes the same rapscallion Tramp we all know but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp one of deep feeling and protectiveness Two people who need and love each other very much This film couldnt missFirst National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin the studio and his estranged wife Mildred Harris The Robert Downey Jr biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itselfTill that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid,9
1135,tt0012349,The Kid was released in  at the pinnacle of the Silent era when emotions came to screen through looks and body language when we didnt need dialog we had faces And if theres one film where Charlie Chaplins face oddly illuminates the screen its definitely The Kid Sure many fans would argue that City Lights is Chaplins masterpiece but something is too perfect too masterfully directed it was made during the talking era Chaplin was in his s and had more experience while The Kid features a more youthful director It belongs to a whole other era and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed in  Chaplin was  Hitchcock  Brando wasnt even born discovering The Kid is like turning the pages of a dusty yellowpaged historical book one eye is watching the film while the other discovers a period And I dont know if Im the only one but theres something in the setting the location that makes the film look even older For all I saw the movie could have been set in the early century and considering the timing of the film maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin himself The film was made in a difficult personal time when hed just lost his son after his birth There was a great wound in Chaplins heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragementThe context of The Kid is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time which is even more impressive considering his sevenyear experience a short time but enough to create an icon the Little Tramp an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema Chaplins story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and Im sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame  and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a filmmakerThe Emigrant in  was like the first step back into Chaplins past inspired by his own experience The movie doesnt feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future and leaving the motherland wasnt synonym of sadness but the emotions were there beyond the slapstick and the comedy and waiting for another step back to finally explode in an emotional firework which directly transports us to Chaplins past He who grew up without a father and started working at an early age he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living before it cemented his talent he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin And this is how The Kid was made and for the first time Chaplin would become more than a simple clown and get all the respect he needed from his peers as a gifted filmmaker He could finally make his first masterpiece The Gold Rush but The Kid was this necessary last breath before taking the big diveMany aspects of The Kid highlight Chaplins past and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs  a woman abandons a child expecting him to be adopted by a rich family until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramps arms But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who despite the archetypal situations didnt make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt as is the father a nicelooking fellow and a sign that Chaplin doesnt hold any grief against his father These things happen and we shouldnt feel sorry as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos  the Tramp and the KidIn every aspect the Kid is Chaplins alter ego  hes smart tender funny sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing Weve seen so many child performances since  to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is and Jackie Coogan is one of the best if not the best almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy and that the kid didnt become as much a star as Chaplin is one of cinemas cruelest ironies The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense closeups on Chaplins face  his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen and whatever inhabits the Tramps heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himselfChaplin like Disney for animation handled drama with the same strength as for comedy the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy fun cheers and even some dreamy escapism allowing a selfreflexive approach of the magic of childhood The Kid is not perfect but its a masterpiece of sincerity of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music If not his best its his most defining film ,9
1136,tt0012349,This is such a incredible movieAlong with City Lights and The Gold Rush this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin and it is also one of the best movies ever madeIt is true that for the modern viewers the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the boxofficeThat doesnt mean this movie isnt entertaining In fact I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny comedies and also way more emotional and engagingI truly loved this film It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldnt be forgotten,10
1137,tt0012349,The opening title to this film reads A film with a smile  and perhaps a tear Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken for Charlie Chaplins The Kid has a plethora of smiles from start to finish and yes a few tears as well The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character played by Chaplin The Tramp takes the baby into his own care Five years go by and the Tramp and the Kid portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan are getting along just fine However a turn of events results in the two being separated and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his sonCharlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking and this film is one of his best His direction is truly remarkable being able to manipulate the audiences emotions so much without sound He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget He manages to make you laugh almost nonstop from start to finish and even wind up causing you to shed a tear Its so emotionally gripping and you just fall in love with these characters from the getgo Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinemaAs emotionally wrenching this film is its simply hilarious This film has some great slapstick humor and Chaplin is a true master of it Jackie Coogan is also great If I had to find one flaw with the film it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I dont really mind it despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film Overall The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute then tug at your heartstrings the next Its an absolute riot but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema Ive ever seen And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue its just incredible And not to mention the music is just stellar too Chaplin is a master at composition The Kid is one of my favorite films and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!,10
1138,tt0012349,When watching this I wanted to give the film a  rather than an  simply because I do not think it is as good as Modern Times or one or two others However taking into account that this is  and the film technology is not all there I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done it could have been made a decade later and looked the sameChaplin has to of course be given a lot of credit for producing writing directing and starring Being a great comic actor is one thing but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid and they nailed it  hes adorable emotional and seems able to handle any situation,8
1139,tt0012349,The worlds most famous tramp is back and this time he has kid sidekick! Sounds kind of gimmicky right? But it works perfectly! Chaplin and child actor Jackie Coogan work extremely well together Their scenes are filled with heart and you can see that they both enjoyed themselves during the making of the movie The movie has the signature Chaplin slapstick that is guaranteed to have you in stitches but it also has some genuinely sad and emotional moments making this movie one of Chaplins most fondly remembered from his gigantic and legendary filmography,10
1140,tt0012349,A tramp finds an abandoned kid on the street He tries to get rid of it in Charlie Chaplin way but ends up raising it with road side values Child becomes an apple of his eyes in a few years but the mother comes back to claim her son I had heard that this was the best movie Charlie Chaplin made but I disagree with that statement completely No doubt its a fantastic movie with a very strong story and message but its definitely not his best I found the last scene of the movie a little contrite and compromising The story has been adapted and tried in very many forms Extremely sensitive and though provoking cinema A must see for all,8
1141,tt0012349,I was hardly a Chaplin fan in fact I loved Laurel &amp; Hardy and really didnt like Charlie Chaplin until I found that I could impersonate him as a lookalike  Then while viewing his films for the need of impersonating I have become a big Charlie Chaplin fan  His comedy mingled with pasos and pantomime was unique and very funny; and this one is certainly one of his bestIn it a sixyear old Jackie Coogan makes his screen debut as a little orphan that the tramp picks up and cares for five years  Every moment of this film is terrific it moves along swiftly and made me shed a tear three or few times  Chaplins score is undeniably a great piece of artwork and the acting is superb; nobody in this film lacksespecially ChaplinI recommend this film for all to see  Its age has not diminished this little love tale for a family in fact it makes you realize family love even more  Youll laugh cry and have a great time out  Rent it  Buy it View it  Its a film for all to see,0
1142,tt0012349,They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but Im not so sure anymore There has been a generational discontinuity at least in the USA that seems to have happened about  or  years ago I suspect that most people over the age of  could identify Charlie Chaplin and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinctionGenerally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation but Jackie Coogan is an exceptionSentimental manipulation there is but its mainly limited to one or two scenes The comedy is pretty acerbic Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again Thats not what passes for sentimentalityBesides Coogan is cute when hes  or  years old a ragamuffin dressed in floppy oversized bags of clothing so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it And the kid can act tooCharlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him which was all he had to do Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because hes too inexperienced to know how to overact Chaplain is good too of course How could one person be so inventive? Its said that TV eats up talent because of the constant demand for new material One of the better series Twilight Zone had about three good years of collaborative effort in it Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in  films and directed something like  of them and he was just getting startedIll give one example of a joke without an iota of sentiment in it to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid a big bully who knocks him about Chaplain spots this interrupts the fight and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing  go for the belly keep your guard up  and sends him back into the fight At this point the bullys hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says If your boy beats my boy Im going to beat you Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bullys chin and flattens him But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back Chaplain dashes over puts his foot on the Coogans chest to hold him down quickly counts to ten rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand  the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy Youll enjoy it Especially if youre one of those rare folks under  with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue,0
1143,tt0012349,A picture with a smile and perhaps a tearThat is the first line of the movie as it begins and it stands true We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling Wow I cant say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story Now we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally recent great movie is Finding Nemo But whats special about this movie is simplicty honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into usDone by the genius Chaplin there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling we either smile or bring tears So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do are done there Winning over a fight from a neighbour meeting angels and all Now look at the editing in this less than an hour film its neat and precise The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film Acting is sublime by Chaplin only few can do what he did and even today hardly anyone can match him Its a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch atlas watch it before you die you may learn something you never wanted to miss Its / for one of the finest silent movies ever,10
1144,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is one of Chaplins best films as well as one of his most famous It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by and its not hard to see why Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector a young miner during the gold rush After getting caught in a storm he hurries to the only shelter that he can find a wood cabin in the middle of the storm It turns out that it is already inhabited and by a tough criminal named Black Larson no less and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim another prospector insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film,10
1145,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is pure gold  It was Charlie Chaplins third featurelength film and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris  which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp  This movie should be counted among Chaplins best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights which Ive also seen as THE best Chaplin movie but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedys immortal geniusesHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV I saw it again in October  as part of my colleges silentfilm class on a poorquality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen ,10
1146,tt0015864,Charles Chaplins The Gold Rush is arguably his finest film He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich What he does not realize is that he may find love in the form of Georgia Hale instead of money In the end that may be all right with him The Gold Rush shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer writer and director he was Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the th Century Chaplin showed humanity love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career The movie is exceptional in every way Although I am not as wellversed with movies from the s as I am with the decades following it I would still probably call The Gold Rush the finest film of that year period Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today  stars out of ,0
1147,tt0015864,The  Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious As an unnamed prospector Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner the dancing roles and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff His companion Big Jim McKay Mack Swain at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplins character to be a chicken and before long a bear enters their cabin In the midst of it all the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia Georgia HaleA real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!,10
1148,tt0015864,To see Charlie Chaplins The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment One cannot help but enjoy a film as welldone as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered and I can see why It is a masterful blend of comedy drama and romance among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture Like all great movies The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramps flawless physical comedy He was a master of comedic timing and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians Ive ever seen Dont get me wrong this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler The film moves along at a brisk pace following the misadventures of our hero The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin of course as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska Along his journey through the elements the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen Tom Murray a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold Fortunately our friend also comes across a fellow prospector Big Jim McKay Mack Swain who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich But the Lone Prospectors adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere When he is forced back to civilization he falls in love with Georgia Georgia Hale the most beautiful girl in town Of course it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite the handsome ladys man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia as well Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the egomaniacal lady killer All of this would be too much for any one of us but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie I am a fan of Charlie Chaplins movies but as objective as I can possibly be this IS one of the great moviesEssential viewing!,10
1149,tt0015864,This silent classic has many strong points  it has a lot of humor interesting characters a good story and good settings  Its the kind of film that shows how much a master filmmaker can communicate in a silent movie  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion but other than that its a fine filmChaplin himself plays the Lone Prospector and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors rickety cabins plus some other good materialThe version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin reedited in the s adding his own narration and deleting the title cards which gives it a slightly different feel  These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who arent used to silent films You can tell from Chaplins narration how fond he must have been of The Gold Rush and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art,0
1150,tt0015864,Charlie Chaplins silent film also rereleased with a narration in the early s focuses as usual on the Little Tramp and in this case his attraction to a chorus girl Georgia Hale This is the one where he eats a boot along with its laces and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rollsThe role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin Lita Grey but her pregnancy ruled her out Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions Mack Swain appears as Big Jim who shares a cabin with the Tramp at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and goldrunners as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time as a sound film it is fairly good,8
1151,tt0015864,Ive seen both version of this filmthe original silent version from  and the rerelease by Chaplin in the s The difference is that the rerelease was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies To do this title cards were removedhaving Chaplin narrate the film In addition Chaplincreated music for the most partsome were classical pieces sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVDit has both plus excellent DVD extras Otherwise there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out theremany with terrible quality prints or music or both The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the  rereleaseI use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film though I might in the future use it for my Psychology classes as well I teach both because Chaplins genius came from his obsessivecompulsive nature The movie reportedly had  times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than  takes!! The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century Along the way he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb Suffice to say the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch something not true of all fulllength slapstick comediessometimes their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to fulllengthThis is a gorgeous wellexecuted piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac The musical score arranged by Chaplin direction acting and cinematography all are simply perfectmaking this in my opinion the best fulllength silent comedy ever made This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keatons films!,10
1152,tt0015864,If any single figure can fairly be said to symbolize the glory years of the silent filmsthe cinemas truly international epochit is Charles Chaplins indomitable tramp The Little Fellow as millions came to call him was at once tatty and debonair browbeaten and irrepressibly optimisticand he was without question the bestloved international star in all of film history His coat was too small his pants too large his mustache patently falseand the resultant silhouette instantly recognizable wherever movies were shown Charlie Chaplins tramp spoke to all walks of lifeand never more eloquently than in such silent films as The Kid and The Gold Rush The Gold Rush is superb It deals with Charlies adventures to win the affection of a local dancehall girl and his hilarious efforts to avoid being eaten by bears and by prospectors who are bigger and hungrier than he The most memorable scene is one in which he dines on an old shoe Chaplins exquisite grace turned the boiled shoe into a gourmet feast he carves it carefully smacks his lips in anticipation and then eats it with gusto and appreciation sucking the nails as if they contained the most juices and twirling the laces around his fork as if they were spaghetti,10
1153,tt0015864,In Charles Chaplins  film The Gold Rush a lone prospector travels to California looking for gold and entwines himself in adventures and finds Georgia the woman of his dreams After many hardships including a relocating cabin the lone prospector played by Charles Chaplin finds gold and becomes rich ending in success and unity with Georgia The time period in which this movie was shot compared with the technological innovation and the state of the art filming techniques give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel The use of upclose shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a new feel to the style of silent cinema The scene with the cabin shifting and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin was one of the many stylistic filming techniques that gave The Gold Rush such artistic and ingenious appeal Chaplins ideas and his vision that he brought to life in the movie The Gold Rush make it a great landmark in the beginning of silent films and in film history The intricate but simple story of The Gold Rush brought about many distinct feelings when viewing It gives feelings of happiness during scenes where there is comedic relief and slapstick comedy and also can bring about sadness or pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Years but she never shows up It reveals how silent films can become in touch with a persons feelings making them feel for the protagonist without having to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot These aspects of The Gold Rush make it a milestone in the film industry of the modern world,9
1154,tt0015864,One of the best Chaplin movies which means one of the best movies ever made Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as `Eating the shoe and `The Roll Dance Both the original version and the second release have their own charm,10

1158,tt0015864,THE GOLD RUSH United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations So proud of his achievement Chaplin reissued this silent film in  with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself eliminating the use of title cards Then in the summer of  THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting stations week series of The Silent Years as hosted by Orson Welles from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William PerryTHE GOLD RUSH which is set in the turn of the century opens with The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin coming to Alaska A snow storm drives him into the cabin of Black Lawson Tom Murray an outlaw Big Jim McKay Mack Swain another prospector who has found gold on his claim is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin After much struggle Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests Stranded due to the heavy storm Larson finds himself chosen to go out for help While out in the storm he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him He gets away by stealing their dog sled but is later killed in an avalanche Back to the cabin Charlie and Larson almost in near starvation eventually make a meal out of a large bear When the snow storm finally subsides the two men go about their separate ways Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia Georgia Hale a dance hall girl causing jealousy from her suitor Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite As for Jim he has forgotten where his gold claim is and locates Charlie to help him find it separating him from Georgia The results that follow is classic ChaplinAside from a large list of supporting players which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis The Gold Rush contains many now classic comedy supplements including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlies encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement There are tender moments too including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Years Eve dinner with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for themWith THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplins most revived and discussed movie one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed including THE CIRCUS  CITY LIGHTS  MODERN TIMES  and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR  Since the advent of home video in the early s THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores ranging from the use of piano organ or orchestra There are even some editions that have no music track at all along with some copies running different time lengths and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout The  reissue being a shorter print with Chaplins narration not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics but can also be found on Chaplins th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a  comedy short PAY DAY Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection But in spite of numerous editions THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics  and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter  reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector avid lip readers will notice that he is called Charlie by his supporting players especially by Georgia ****,10
1159,tt0015864,If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability t you a commend this film as well as City Lights  Modern Times isnt strictly speaking a silent film although Chaplin had no dialogue there  The Gold Rush while not Chaplins best film does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits it must be seen  Excellent film   version redone by Chaplin is a bit better but either will do  Most highly recommended,10
1160,tt0015864,To be perfectly honest I wish I could denounce Chaplin more fervently than I find myself able to Right down to my fundamental worldview I am a Buster Keaton person the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness The world as I understand it just doesnt work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay So wishing it did only fosters more painThis is actually worst than The Kid in this respect Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold Oh though filthy rich at that point when in the end he falls practically in the girls arms he is again dressed like a tramp  meaning no doubt he is still the same person  but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul here he gets both There is not even the thought of a compromiseYet I cant help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplins cosmology; the mysterious elusive fates  seemingly random but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose  that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocksNowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside the reality thought to be known understood domesticated into order but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void So every step inside taken casually without much thought is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death Blissful ignorance the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabinIt is a powerful cosmologic symbol what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life With both gold and love impossible love with the dream girl as the chimeras that trick the mindSo Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside but either cannot properly understand – and confuses karma for providential fate  or he does is terrified and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy taleSo however wellmeant its a dishonest patronizing vision of bliss Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging but eventually benevolent whims of providence Its all made right again more than rightNotice how well integrated is this notion inside the film proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the pointofview of the tramp who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger souldefining mechanisms that shape his life that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lessonSo instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill just wait and itll all work out in the end It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the filmSure it is occasionally very funny inventive But were talking here about the more intricate mechanisms that drive a film  and film aspiring to be a truthful reflection of life life itself,0
1161,tt0015864,This is the first silent film I have ever seen so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound other than the piano in the background in a  minute movie So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas acrossI felt like they did some of same gags over and over again like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove It just got really old to me quickly I dont know maybe because Im from a different time period and way life but the film just didnt do anything for me I didnt really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only  to  minutes long and nothing would have been lost,3
1162,tt0015864,Make them laugh make them laugh The American comic tradition and American movies were made for each other Gold Rush is one example that Charlie Chaplin was the father of American comedy Even though Chaplin loves to press political economical or social messages in his films The Gold Rush remains true to its genre It is a comedy non the less Even at the end of the film when THE TRAMP receives a kiss Chaplin reminds the audience that she has ruined the picture with the kiss This is suppose to be a comedy!,9
1163,tt0015864,Spoilers hereinI consider `City Lights to be a masterwork one of the films that every literate person must see This film is often equally celebrated but it seems to be a random collection of integrated ideas to me Some work most dontThe  rescore and voiceover is much tighter visually but sonicly heavy If you have a chance with the DVD see it in the  recut with no sound and subtitlesThe one skit that works the best is the famous dancing rolls bit You really must see three versions of this one after another Look at the original Then see the Robert Downey Jr version done in  almost  years later Notice how much more comic Downeys is because he uses a different timing and is both doing it and referencing the Chaplin dance Then see the Johnny Depp version of the year later which pokes fun at the Downey version and reannotates the original A work of genius overlain on a masterpieceOtherwise there are better silent comedies to see And better ChaplinTeds Evaluation   of  Has some interesting elements,0
1164,tt0015864,The Gold Rush is a showcase of sorts for Chaplin In it he provides audiences with a wide range of cinematic elements from his signature slapstick routines to dramatic relationships The rags to riches plot was interesting and witty but felt dragged out While Chaplin is good at emotionally engaging the audience with relateable situations like getting stood up or competing for a woman the lack of serious conflict makes the film seem simple The special effects were handled nicely even by todays standards but the true enjoyment in the film comes from watching the tramp endure hardship as he accidentally progresses into wealthiness and sees his life fall together by favorable coincidence,6
1165,tt0015864,Spoiler AlertThe Gold Rush is perhaps one of the best silent movies I have ever seenAlthough it takes a bit to get used to silent movie language youll be rewarded with a marvelousfunny and poignant movieSome of the scenes are hilarious and some really touches your heartstrings Chaplin as performer gives one of his best performances in this movie There are plenty of great scenesChaplin and Mack Swain in the cabincrazy with hunger and cabin feverthe touching New Years Eve party and finally the hilarious finale with the cabin out on the edge of a cliffThe later version which was released with added narration and music wasnt as good as the originalbut easier for modern audiences to watch,8
1166,tt0015864,What a delightful film I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them like the eating shoe scene fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Years Eve knowing that he was stoodup I genuinely felt for him Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time Brilliant,10
1167,tt0015864,The primitive production values the decrepitlooking camera work and the silent soundtrack with only musical scores to suffice for the lack of the talkie in that era does little to ruin the viewers chance of being entertained by this highly enjoyable classic masterpiece by Charlie Chaplin The Little Tramp finds himself in the Yukon braving the wintery elements bears and a psychopath all for the sake of claiming his own fortune of gold Under his expert direction Chaplin guides THE GOLD RUSH with painstaking detail of what life would be like to live in the freezing extremes having to shack up in a  cabin in danger of toppling over a snowcapped cliff and feasting on shoes for protein Amidst all the atrocities Chaplin being that likeable underdog that everybody roots for and loves overcomes the odds managing to make the best out of a bad read terrible situation He even takes the time to humor himself and a few ladies with a songanddance number involving two forks and a pair of potatoes,0
1168,tt0015864,The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights?  There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator  There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramps world City Lights falls short  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what Charlot has been all about all along It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplins works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime  out of ,10
1169,tt0017136,Technically speaking I have seen this Fritz Lang silent scifi before but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the s The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable apocalyptic fantasy and religious allegory It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers who toil in the depths tending the machines and the upper classes who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers The hero the idle pampered son of the citys supervisor Joh Fredersen changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria the Madonna of the workers His father meanwhile is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didnt see In addition to restoring scenes to the film the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version With these changes the story becomes much clearer particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis Perhaps most importantly a whole new subplot is added involving the heros dead mother Hel who was loved by both his father and Rotwang With this clarification of the backstory the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer In some ways it recalls the family backstory of the Star Wars movies Of course the real strength of Metropolis isnt the story which is pretty silly and probably wouldnt have worked in anything but a silent film but its amazing visuals which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to  and Blade Runner Actually though in most respects silent films now look primitive one area in which they have the edge over modern filmmaking is in their frequently grandiose production design Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world The models of the citys towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a s film Even beyond the expansive production design and for the time special effects Langs visuals are all consistently inventive The robot Maria provides some of the movies most iconic images including her transformation into a human being In a later scene she performs for upperclass men in a nightclub and as she performs a striptease that in s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs A sign of Langs visual lavishness and the studios that he doesnt hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a characters state of mind For instance when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idols head into which the workers are being sacrificed At another point while hes sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs labor parable and Lang gives us spectacular images of the towers construction and fall In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and overliteral but theyre what silent cinema does best tell a story without the advantage or obstacle of dialogue The story is a little slow to start but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that Ive seen In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films as the workers riot and sabotage the machines endangering the entire city Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than  years,9
1170,tt0017136,Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the s? Sure some science fiction movies are huge today such as George Lucas latest goofy Star Wars movie but in  Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then And sure enough we went right ahead living the way we were living the population got bigger and more crowded and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society Metropolis was run by his father John Frederson the master of Metropolis He lives in a Pleasure Garden high above the level of the workers and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father given the terrible conditions under which they live and work Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic sinister looking machine The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devillooking monster  After countless workers are consumed by it no wonder this was Hitlers favorite film they are immediately replaced by other workers who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements If some of these scenes men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured and the rest of the workers keep right on working hardly even noticingThe way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated `Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups is a saying that doesnt necessarily only apply to stupid people as Metropolis suggests Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue and the result is still compelling today The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways except that the two films can hardly be compared  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least An excellent film Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten,10
1171,tt0017136,I doubt that Id ever seen anything resembling a complete version of METROPOLIS before though certain of its scenes were familiar to me if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keatons HEAVEN   In any case whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration  I expected to be distracted by the restorations technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it  As exaggerated as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards some performances such as the Master of the city are amazingly nuanced and layered and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone The meticulous design of the film the unerring camera placement and Langs muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking Id thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity important = dull but now Ive come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been,10
1172,tt0017136,Fritz Langs Metropolis is the first true masterpiece of science fiction in film You can see its influence in films such as Star Wars The Matrix Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Blade Runner and countless others Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were in some cases phenomenal I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is  years old because a lot has happened in film since then Yet if you look at the basic elements of this movie  its story characters artwork cinematography etc I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late s Also take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this The performances and set designs are going to be over the top That was part of the style Metropolis may not be for everyone but for those willing to read between the lines this film still has a lot to offer!,8
1173,tt0017136,In the future the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes the workers who live in the underground below the machines level and the dominant classes that lives on the surface The workers are controlled by their leader Maria Brigitte Helm who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles Maria meets Freder Fredersen Gustav Fröhlich the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen Alfred Abel in a meeting of the workers and they fall in love for each other Meanwhile Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate themMetropolis is a fantastic futuristic view of the fight of classes When Metropolis was shot it was a romantic revolutionary period of mankind history with socialist movements around the world Fritz Lang directed and wrote the screenplay of this masterpiece certainly inspired in this historical moment and defending a position of agreement and understanding between both sides showing that they need each other I wonder how this great director was able to produce such special effects in  with very primitive cameras and equipment The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art My vote is tenTitle Brazil MetropolisNote On  March  I saw this film again on BluRay,10
1174,tt0017136,Metropolis is surely one of the greatest films ever made  Its scope its reach its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by todays standards of filmmaking  Seen in context of its premier in  Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history  Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great and in particular Metropolis  A great film is one that stirs the imagination leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life and achieves a kind of immortality  Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria  Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings halluciatory scenes and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions  There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria  Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups  Lastly Metropolis has stood the test of time  It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre  The story itself is simplea Biblical allegory about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen  The film is anything but simple  It is immense and a rich legacy that director Fritz Lang has left us,0
1175,tt0017136,I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie This is without a doubt the best scifi movie Ive ever seen! Let me explain my position We have all seen modern scifi movies and argued over which is the best ever made but those film makers have high speed film and computers Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in  and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must see for all persons interested in the history of film as well as just good fun for everyone The social metaphores as well as the religious and philosophical double meanings are a sight to behold,10
1176,tt0017136,This must be one of the greatest movies of all time I found myself almost in a state of shock during the whole movie Everything was perfect The story was great the filming was pure genius and the effects directly from another dimensionI dont think any movie after this one have gotten so much out of the available effects of the time as this one Nowadays they have super computers generating special effects Sure they look good but its no big deal making them Back in  computers werent even invented yet all effects had to be done by hand or in simple editing And when you take a look at all the thins that have been done in this movie its impossible not to get impressed Huge buildings explosions flooding picture phones however did he come up with the very idea? transformation sequences robots and so on No movie has ever pulled the limits of special effects as much as this one Star Wars and Jurassic Park are also known as limit pullers in special effects but they dont even come closeThen you have the filming Everything is perfect The use of body language is tremendous the light setting perfect everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera Ive never been witness to such a treat in filming other placesAnd the story!!! Perfect in every detail Intriguing exciting and thrilling with lots of religious undertones and tyranic leaders No wonder Hitler liked this movieI dont know how the original music of the film was but the new music for the restored  minute version I saw was really good and moodsetingAll in all This is one of the most perfect movies of all time and it deserves anything it can get Never has a / been as secure as for this movie,10
1177,tt0017136,Silent movies are not for everyone Neither are subtitles Those brave enough to view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between should definitely enjoy this silent masterpiece One of the biggest productions of its time Metropolis still holds its own when set design and special effects are compared But what Metropolis really has is orginality This GermanExpressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future modern city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern scifi Star Warss CPO was based on Bridgette Helms robot Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis lookalike cities This is a very good movie Its too bad most movies dont have its originality,9
1178,tt0017136,Fritz Langs groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema How can a movie thatll soon turn  years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages The world has been divided into two main categories thinkers &amp; workers! If you belong to the first category you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if youre a worker your life isnt worth a penny and youre doomed to perilous labor underground The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself Its essential viewing anyway! Metropolis is a very demanding filmexperience and definitely not always entertaining But as it is often the case with silentcinema classics the respect and admiration youll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoymentaspect Fritz brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to recreate a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines Many supposedly restored versions have been released over the years in  and  for example but the version is still the finest in my opinion even though that one already isnt as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it Metropolis perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made  A Space Odyssey Star Wars and Blade Runner owe their existence or at least their power to it,8
1179,tt0017136,Metropolis is my alltime favourite movie so Ive saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb Ive enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies Ive seen but now Im moving on to other passionsAlthough written by Fritz Langs wife Thea von Harbou Metropolis was originally Langs idea he was inspired by the sight of New Yorks skyscrapers when he sailed to America in  During his American trip he visited the set of The Phantom of the Opera and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasnt filmedDespite its epic power Metropolis makes very little sense The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen so why is the one named Freder*sen* the father not son of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwangs crude little cottage the only preFredersen building that wasnt demolished during the construction of this city? Von Harbous very long and unwieldy novelisation of her script establishes this fact but never explains it How and why did Rotwangs hightech laboratory manage to get constructed BENEATH that cottage without disturbing it?For modern viewers some of the plots incoherence can be blamed on missing footage particularly in American prints The distributors for this films original Stateside release commissioned playwright Channing Pollock to translate the German titles A major subplot of the backstory features a deceased woman named Hel who was married to Rotwang but left him to marry Fredersen and give birth to Freder This unseen womans name could not easily be changed for the American version due to a couple of shots of her memorial engraved with the Teutonic name HEL Apparently Pollock feared that American viewers would be offended by this words similarity to Hell so he simply excised the entire subplot from this long movieThe reallife drama on the set of Metropolis mustve been quite interesting in itself Mad scientist Rotwang alias Doctor Strangeglove is played by actor Rudolf KleinRogge who had been married to scenarist von Harbou before she left him to marry Fritz Lang the mastermind of this film In Metropolis Rotwangs wife left him to marry the master of Metropolis Id love to know how KleinRogge felt about the fact that his reallife marital and sexual situation was the inspiration for key plot elements of this movie  and I wonder how KleinRogge felt about knowing that the entire cast and crew knew this as wellMost astonishing about this gargantuan production is the fact that nearly all of Metropolis was actually built to scale with just a couple of miniaturesTrivia tidbit actress Brigitte Helm was cast in the dual female role largely because she was flatchested and therefore she could easily fit inside the mechanical suit for the Robotrix A more busty actress would have suffered constant discomfort inside those galvanised bosoms of the metal costume I learnt this more than  years ago from an eldery Austrian stagehand who worked on the filmFor all its flaws Metropolis will always be my favourite movie Ive enjoyed writing all these reviews for IMDb The joy of posting my reviews on this site has brought me many friendships and a few enemies Well you cant win em allNitrate film stock doesnt last forever and all good things come to a happy ending This is my last review here Ill keep watching movies but other passions are important to me as well Thank you IMDb and thank you to everyone who has read my reviews I will happily rate Metropolis a full  out of ,10
1180,tt0017136,One definitely cant fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Langs vision even if as always with depictions of the future there are a few forgivable blind spots The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the s as are the flyingmachines that buzz about them; while the business dress of tomorrows rulers unlike their exotic leisure wear doesnt appear to have advanced one iota!HGWells criticised the film for its adherence to arty image over scientific rigour and as a piece of coherent science fiction its certainly as lacking as he claimed The machines exist to appear awesome and to torment their workers rather than to perform any apparent task and there is no explanation of how this society functions how it evolved or how it is sustained let alone of the incongruities that must surely lie behind such anomalous locations as the catacombs and the cathedral But Wells own futuristic film Things to Come conceived in direct riposte to Langs unscientific approach is tedious and talky as a result didactic in its heavyfooted philosophy and explanations and lacking in artistic vision Metropolis may be soft SF but its approach undoubtedly makes for better cinemaI am not however impressed by it as a film Masterpiece of Modernism it may be  but great design and special effects cant save todays bigbudget clunkers from deficiencies of character and plot and they dont save this one Ironically I suspect that its reputation has benefited greatly from its being the only silent film many of its viewers have ever encountered reading through the IMDb pages I see wellmeaning comments like Great  when you consider how primitive cinema was in  and once you get used to the fact that it takes about ten gestures to convey one sentence It wasnt  and it doesnt!As silent films go this is in many places agonizingly slow and repetitious marred by clumsy acting tendentious titles and overwrought gestures By the late s cinema had progressed far beyond this laboured pantomime in Langs case the heavy stylisation may have been a deliberate choice but compared to the fluidity of contemporaries such as Sjostroms The Wind or The Scarlet Letter Asquiths Underground or Shooting Stars and Murnaus Sunrise the film comes across as ten years behind the times The problem is not necessarily with the actors  Brigitte Helm as has been observed does an excellent job in differentiating her two characters  but with the direction and pacingWe saw the restored version with the original Gottfried Huppertz score; the latter didnt always seem to fit too well with pops jumps and awkward silences but this was I assume due either to the difficulty of fitting it to allow for the missing material or to problems in the projection booth when running a newlyarrived print for the first time However the painstaking summary of the various missing scenes only ended up increasing my appreciation of what a good job had been done in the editingdown in the first place! To take a single example where the edited version conveys Freders sudden recollection that he is supposed to be the workers longawaited mediator via the simple juxtaposition of three shots  the shiftchange whistle announcing the meeting the catacombs and Freder suddenly struck by an idea and rushing off  the restoration betrays the fact that a couple of scenes of mimed dialogue were originally provided to spell out the message at painstaking lengthIt is interesting to see how it was done but most of the cuts are either an improvement or a very clever abridgement and by and large I didnt feel that what was omitted had been any great loss In fact frankly I felt that the film was in need of further editing at certain points such as Rotwangs pursuit of Maria through the catacombs She screams and runs and screams and runs and is pursued by a searchlight effect; its clever selfconsciously clever the first couple of times but the repetition becomes tedious to the point of caricature Plot infelicities abound in increasing numbers culminating in the infamous Hunchback of Notre Damestyle ending where the mad scientist carries off the girl across the roof of the cathedral hotly pursued by Our Hero which raised giggles in a hitherto serious and respectful audience with which I couldnt help but sympathiseThis is a film to see once in a lifetime so that you can say that you have seen it  not least because most of the impact lies in the visuals But its all surface and no substance the characters act arbitrarily the plot is subservient to the Message the pacing is like treacle the storytelling technique is primitive and really all it has going for it is the visual flair and the special effects I quite honestly believe that this work would be better appreciated as a set of stills in a glossy brochure; an exhibit in a design exhibition This is not cinema as I love it  its innovative it may be Art but as an actual film its only a poor shadow,6
1181,tt0017136,There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator This is the predominant theme of Metropolis and director Fritz Lang finds numerous ways to say and visualize his message during the course of the film The movie relies on repeated visual imagery to make its point and does so effectively even if tedious at times Particularly effective is the representation of the worker society as an almost single living unit moving trance like to their appointed time and task The use of a ten hour clock in the workers chamber constantly draws our attention as does the hangdog posture of the individual slaves who grind out their workday as if in a dazeAmid this rabble worker Maria Brigitte Helm is the inspirational voice of the workers offering hope for a brighter future by a mediator yet to appear However the Master of Metropolis John Frederson Alfred Abel sees in her a way to quell the underlying frustration of the workers commissioning his scientist Rotwang to create a robot Maria to plant discord among the workers Rotwangs laboratory would have done Frankenstein proud and the creation of the robot is a marvel of cinematic imagery The robot Marias belly dance transforms into a scene of such raw energy and sexual awareness that it awakens the statues of the Seven Deadly Sins one of the master strokes of this expressionist filmSo much imagery in fact is layered into Metropolis that its safe to say that repeat viewings will lead to even more interpretations of its vision and not simply for its denunciation of a class society Both timely and timeless the film captures a dynamism that inspires passion even after nearly eighty years following its original release,8
1182,tt0017136,I really hate it when I dont enjoy a classic film I really want to enjoy it but I just cant I want to understand some peoples love for it but I just cant Metropolis falls under this category An unbearably slow film I watched the restoration which is over  hours longthat may have been a bad idea that starts off with interesting ideas but then seems to not really do much with them It is the year  the wealthy rule the city of Metropolis while the lowerclass work for hours on end underground in awful conditions The Master of Metropolis is Joh Fredersen Alfred Abel and his son is Freder Gustav Frohlich who spends his days with other rich people in a place called the pleasure garden where he truly does nothing at all A woman named Maria Brigitte Helm brings a group of working children up for a visit in pleasure garden and Freder is quickly enamored by Maria Freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shocked as an explosion goes off and kills multiple workers He reports this to his father who is disappointed his son was the first to report it over his assistant Josepha Theodor Loos and his assistant is quickly fired This does an immediate job of showing the coldness of Joh but they never do much else with his character In fact very little of the characters are developed in anyway Most of them are completely uninteresting and the setting itself is compelling at first but quickly loses anything interesting halfway through the film as the film moves at a snail pace Anyways the main aspect of the plot here is that the workers are led by Maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of a mediator to make it happen My real issue is that the film starts with such a great idea and had potential to become something like  Im aware it came out afterwords and that its a novel but still just an example but it instead becomes filled with strange religious allusions and becomes a witch hunt essentially by the end They never really do any decent social commentary at all If any at all This wouldnt matter if the film was actually entertaining but it only is in spurts and then quickly becomes a repetitive bore I do think the special effects were impressive and this film is obviously important for being the first full length science fiction filmwell ever That doesnt mean it holds up because it doesnt In fact itd be hard for me to believe the film was entertaining in  I still wonder if I had watched the shorter version of the film how much more I wouldve enjoyed the film It certainly wouldve have been paced better considering so much of this film is unbelievably uninteresting But I dont think that changes the fact that this movie doesnt really do anything It isnt entertaining It doesnt really have a message What is this movie? I guess good special effects for ? Whatever Im glad I gave this classic a chance but I highly doubt Ill revisit it anytime soon,4
1183,tt0017136,This review contains Spoilers But since the story is by far the least reason to watch Metropolis feel free to still read it even if you havent watched it yetMetropolis is a film that was far ahead of its time It influenced a great lot of sciencefiction films and how The Blade Runner Batman or Dark City would look like if there wasnt Metropolis  who knows Even The Matrix Reloaded is heavily inspired by this classic that is as old as my grandmother Now what is it all about? About Freder the son of the head of the city of Metropolis a Christlike figure who falls in love with the preacher of the working class a saintlike woman who happens to be named Maria When a robot who is modeled to look like Maria makes the workers almost extinguish their city and their children Maria and Freder save the children and in the end Freder makes his father and the workers cooperate for a brighter futureSounds silly to you? Yes and thats exactly what the story is silly Thats also the reason why still today Metropolis isnt accepted as the masterpiece it is by a few film buffs But these people dont understand one thing A good film does more than only tell a story A film can be great even without a story at all and a silly story combined with amazing visuals can make you forget all the other weaknesses a film has And wow what amazing images Metropolis offers What an art direction! What wonderful special effects! And remember as I already said this film is as old as my grandmother! Just have a look at the workers They hardly ever seem to be individuals In the mass scenes they look like one big creature moving forward or backwards When they are working they look more like machines than like human beings whereas the machines resemble monsters more than they do technical devices best seen in the moments when Freder hallucinates and sees the big machine as a workereating Moloch We also see a worker and later Freder work on a machine that looks like a clock with  blinking light bulbs doing some that looks as exhausting as it looks senseless Or think of Rotwang the mad inventor who lives in a little hut that looks in this film like it was from another world He has a black prosthesis for his right hand its not a coincidence that Stanley Kubrick gave his mad scientist/inventor Dr Strangelove a prosthesis for his right hand too He builds the robot that he makes to look like Maria and that transformation scene is one of the most magnificent scenes ever and looks more convincing than some scenes of modern scifi flicks I also have to mention Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and the robot  and the look in her eyes would already be enough to tell which of her characters is on screen at the moment If something like awards already would have been given in the s she sure would have walked home with quite a bunch of them And just look at her sexy dance! It is just as memorable as the shot of the many eyes watching her dance  or the many faces watching her preach just a few minutes later Metropolis is a film no scififan should miss I had the good luck that my first viewing of Metropolis one year ago was in a cinema when it was a rereleased after its restoration I can only recommend you to watch it in a cinema if you have the possibility to as Metropolis is just as   A Space Odyssey one of those rare films that are masterpieces on your TV set but a revelation on the big screen,10
1184,tt0017136,I was very anxious to see Metropolis for the first time I had been into silent movies for a couple of years but hadnt had the opportunity to see Fritz Langs classic I finally saw it at a silent movie theater in Hollywood and my feelings were to say the least mixedThe film is visually stunning Monumental sets brilliantly directed scenes amazing special effects by the standards of the time In fact I might say that I was more enthralled by the visual effects of this movie than I was by say Lord of the Rings or Avatar Whereas Cameron and Jackson used CGI to make their visions come true; Lang had to use camera trickery paint and woodThis movie no doubt set the lexicon for the SciFi and blockbuster genre in stone The images of Metropolis have been repeated in innumerable movies The scene of the underground city being flooded has curious similarities to James Camerons Titanic Even the villainous Rotwang can be seen in the characters Dr Strangelove and Doc Brown from Back to the FutureBut then theres the story And the dialogue And the acting which is overwrought even by the standards of the time But I dont have enough room to go into thatStarting with the opening line LookThese are your brothers a violent cringe would run through my body every time the intertitles would appearThe later line about the head and hands needing the heart as mediator caused a huge outburst of laughter in the theater This serves as the basis for the moral of the story which was eerily similar to How the Grinch Stole Christmas Essentially it can boiled down to this Somebody according to writer Thea von Harbous later beliefs this turned out to be Adolf Hitler needs to appeal to the hearts of capitalist managers and tell them to be nice to their workers The outcome is a grudging handshake between the head manager Joh Frederson and the leader of the workers Grot; and thus begins a shining new day!Metropolis also incorporates religious symbolism which is to say the very least heavyhanded Scenes of the Seven Deadly Sins The Tower of Babel an altar to Moloch and the Flood all warn of doom to decadent societies that exploit the weak and kill the righteousIn the end this muddled mixture of Socialist calls for justice and Christian Apocalypticism creates a political message that Lang himself described as sillyI recommend this film for its artistic brilliance and groundbreaking techniques But dont go into this expecting an award quality filmIf you want to get into silent film this is a relatively easy one to get start with However I dont know if thats a good or a bad thing Ive met too many people whove said that Metropolis was the best silent movie theyve ever seen; which probably means that it was the only one that they ever bothered to watch I would recommend Sunrise or City Lights as a first over this,5
1185,tt0017136,Francis Ford Coppola once said that Apocalypse Now wasnt just about Vietnam is was Vietnam In a similar way Metropolis isnt just about the Twentieth Century it is the Twentieth Century Almost every image in it reflects or more often predicts the realities of life in the West over the past hundred years in a way that is truly uncannyFrom small details  the traffic jams and blackouts that plague city dwellers  to major historical events  the climactic flood predicts every industrial disaster that has destroyed the lives of thousands of workers from Chernobyl to the Bhopal disaster whilst Fredersens vision of workers being fed to Moloch cant help but bring to mind the holocaust  Metropolis feels prescient in any number of ways In the image of the Manhattan skyline Lang really did find the perfect symbol of the coming century  progressive new faceless oppressiveThis is far from the simple Marxist fable it is often taken for  although the Socialist message can hardly be ignored Its also a Christian parable Maria flanked by crosses is counterbalanced by the Machine brought to life under a pentagram informed by the book of Revelation; a retelling of the Orpheus myth with Freder as Orpheus and Maria as Eurydice lost in the underworld; and a Kafkaesque nightmare of depersonalisation although the Gothic expressionistic production design is a long way from Kafkas more sterile styleIts also lest we forget a silly adventuremelodrama with a mad scientist an evil twin a bad father with a noble son and an impossibly virtuous idealised heroine In many ways it anticipates Star Wars in dressing up mythic standards with Science Fiction tropes  with Fredersen as the misguided King Freder as the handsome Prince Maria the goodhearted peasants daughter Rotwang as a scheming sorcerer and the Machine as the wicked witch appropriately burnt at the stake by the villagersThe MachineMan a confusing name for a construction so obviously feminine is the single most indelible image of the film; the scene in which Rotwang brings her to life for the first time is a real moment of magic and awe untarnished by eighty subsequent years of cinematic showmanship Even better is the scene in which she becomes a duplicate of Maria  such an obvious influence on James Whales Frankenstein that its hard not to shout out Its alive! The optical effects are years ahead of their time certainly the best of their kind until the sixties at least It also marks the beginning of Brigitte Helms truly extraordinary turn as the false MariaThis is only the third silent film Ive seen after Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and its taken me a while to acclimatise to the acting style which can seem close to parody What it really reminds me of however is modern dance which similarly seeks to communicate with the audience visually rather than verbally Metropolis encourages this comparison with the highly choreographed movements of the workers operating the machinery Bearing this in mind Helm is hugely impressive in multiple roles Maria could be a rather dull and virtuous heroine she enters the film surrounded by poor children in rags but Helm invests her with enormous energy and expressiveness It helps that the script allows her to take an unusually proactive role for a female character organising workers meetings and racing to the rescue of the endangered children However it is her performance as bad Maria vamping up a storm that lingers in the memory  the twitching jerking movements of her head and body the Anne Robinson style halfwink that changes the shape of her face that malicious little grin that makes it hard not to root for her mischief The entirely weird erotic dance that she performs isnt technically very good or erotic but it is utterly unforgettable Subtextually shes the Whore of BabylonThe other performances are mainly very good particularly Alfred Abel as Fredersen proving that it is possible to underplay in a silent film Only Rudolf KleinRogge hits any wrong notes  difficult as it undoubtedly must be to play a mad scientist in a silent film with subtlety some of his more unrestrained gesticulations leave you worried about the safety of the other actorsUltimately though it all inevitably comes back to the imagery Langs film remains unmatched even today Pick a scene any scene  the synchronised shuffling crowds at the shift change; our first sighting of the Metropolis all biplanes skyscrapers and suspended motorways; the vision of Moloch; the MachineMan awakening; Maria pursued along a pitchblack tunnel by a beam of light; the statue of Death coming to life in the Cathedral; disembodied eyes entranced by the twitching false Maria; the crowds swarming up the steps in the Tower of Babel section; the lifts crashing down one by one; desperate children crowding around Maria as the floodwaters close in; and most of all false Maria laughing as she burns on her pyre then transforming back to her metal visage No film before or since matches this for spectacle And if in order to appreciate it you have to swallow a little treacle about the heart being the mediator between head and hands well trust me its worth it,9
1186,tt0017136,We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Langs Metropolis are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upperclass and operated by slavelike poor The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan These elements can be found in this films ancestors Frankenstein Batman Gattaca and the cities of Blade Runner Star Wars and The Fifth Element All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Langs workMetropolis has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes After its success in  the film has had an uneasy time Its pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in  Unless a lost version surfaces as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentinos  film Beyond the Rocks the complete work my never be seen again The restored version released on DVD in  was based on a digital restoration at K resolution from all available sources Its the best version that Ive seen and I would highly recommend that one if you havent seen the film The worst is a  print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration the film in grainy and difficult to see it doesnt even have a soundtrack I call that one the worst because Im still a little ambivalent about the  restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting good sound effects not so good and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy Freddy Mercury Bonnie Tyler Adam Ant and Pat Benatar yuck!Those who study the film myself included find the story impenetrable Some films you can easily decipher but Metropolis has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that its hard to pin it down as a whole Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the films chaotic nature It takes place in the future restored versions offer title cards that suggest that its the year  but I dont go by that in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers the Gothic sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives dancing in their penthouses and spending their money The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step They dont so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses slaves building his pyramids The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another One person that isnt ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his officeHis son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the workers children Curious he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there The woman is Maria a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be foundFreder uncovers a plot by Rotwang the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms This leads to the films most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzyThen all Hell breaks loose but the rest I must leave to you to discoverLang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film and therefore less successful the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers At one point Freder disguised as a worker witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen Another suggests an odd device a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around its edge The machine doesnt seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless dayThe film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism astonishing in its use of light and shadow One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in Another brilliant moment comes with Marias erotic dance as the men gawk the camera filled with their moist eyes This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home videoOther moments have deeper resonance There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves Walking to work they march with their heads down dressed in uniforms and caps It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler More obvious are Langs biblical references The rise of the city parallels Marias retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel The giant pentagram in Rotwangs lab as he plays God The breathtaking image of the plaguebringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself There is even a Christlike quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakersThese elements and images are brought to the film because of Langs insistence on no less then absolute perfection He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster working his cast and crew like a dictator He cast some  extras  of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone and worked them from morning till night The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with himI could go on and on this film all great films invite lengthy discussions It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over But when you get down to it the best way to view Metropolis is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of its time Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad,0
1187,tt0017136,This truly is a classic masterpiece and honestly one of the best movies ever made The story is brilliant and the visuals amazingI have seen the German  minutes version of the movie without subtitles Yes its a long watch but its worth every second of it Basically only reason why the movie is so long is because they need about ten hand gestures to speak one sentence Its kind of dreadful to look at first but once youre used to it it shouldnt trouble you anymoreIn many ways this movie can be regarded as the Blade Runner of the s Metropolis is set in a futuristic world that has a same kind of atmosphere as in Blade Runner The mix of s cars and propellerplanes with futuristic machines highways buildings and androids is very unusual but an absolutely awesome thing to look at The movie was ahead of its time and in some ways also propheticThe story is absolutely the best thing of the movie Also the way the story is told and directed by Fritz Lang deserves credit The story is tense and has quite some symbolism layers and storylines but remains always easy to follow The ending is truly spectacular and tense The way how spectacular and tense the ending and the entire movie in general was really surprised me in a positive wayThe sets are obviously fake and miniatures at times but they still manage to convince and impress Further more the movie is filled with some fantastic and very convincing early special effectsMan who also deserves credit is Alfred Abel Wow what a great actor he was in this movieAn absolute must see and one of the best movies of all time/http//bobafettblogspotcom/,10
1188,tt0017136,MetropolisMetropolis is one of the most exciting and exceptional works of art that humankind has produced This epic science fiction film is one of Germanys famous silent movies created by Fritz Lang and liberated in  the period between the two World WarsThis movie represents the expressionist cinema and shows us the repression of human needs by the machine age Langs creation of a selfdestructive society is a protest against the machine age Metropolis is one of the most magnificent cities of  is kept alive by the unceasing work of the underground people who live in slavery and is enjoyed by wealthy and educated people The Austrian director of the movie Fritz Lang presents the story of a master John Federsen who sees people as machines working constantly to maintain the luxury and technology of his metropolis On the other side his son Freder falls in love with one of the underground workers who is a spiritual leader for the slaves The son recognizes the unsentimental heart of his father and starts a revolution The city gets flooded and Maria Freders love regains the workers trust after a robot had stolen her identity she finds her loved one after saving the citys children and the workers shake hands with the masterExpressionism tries to simplify the world and to understand it emotionally in a subjective way It is very important to understand this definition of this dynamic violent and distorted movement in order to understand that Lang tried to externalize his own internal vision of the world through simple expressions The name metropolis comes from the Greeks and means mothercity It has this significance because a metropolis is the biggest form of a technologically and economically developed city Nevertheless referring to the movie name this film can be considered as the mother city of all cinematic clichés In this story there are two main characters Maria and Freder These two characters are also the heroes of the story because they are the ones who rescue the population from being drowned in the flood John Federson is a person full of empowering feelings who only thinks of himself and of his city forgetting about the ones who work for him All the fantasies that he has come true through the power of his workers but he never thinks about the danger they are in while working for him This man wants so much power that he is almost hypnotized by it; he is obsessed and possessed by the power of inventions and creationsOn the other hand Maria is just a symbol of munificence her soul is pure and she is seen like an angel who brings peace to the world Maria convoys the people in a church settling area She is shown as sanctity a holy person that is surrounded by the light of the candles She is positioned higher than the workers who carefully listen to her as she speaks about peace unity and their salvation by a mediator that will soon come Her eyes inspire confidence and kindness as she kisses Freder in the church scene In general all she does is for the good of humanity One thing that she repeats in the movie is Between the head and hands there must be a heart  This means that she realizes the bad things that the head John Frederson does and the good things that the hands workers do But she knows that these workers should not be treated poorly or like robots and that she can be the heart which can persuade the head and the hands to cooperate to come to common interests Maria as her name suggests is also a biblical motif She explains to the workers the story of the Tower of Babel The workers in the story destroy this tower which parallels how the movie will end with the destruction of the machines by the workforce Maria is still the representation of Jesus mother because she is trying to save the lives of the underground children She would sacrifice herself and alike Mother Mary she has a strong faith in the creator of the world All the scenes of this film are perfectly created at the eye level so that anyone is able to view the action However there is also a birds eye view at the beginning of the movie as the panorama of the city is shown from high above the ground This view was created to give us an impression of how widely extended and huge Metropolis is In addition the focus of the dramatic camera angles with bold shadows is on the disproportioned landscape as well as on the rightangled buildings There are moments in which the camera focuses on fast movement scenes like the dancing of the robot in the nightclub and scenes where it focuses on slow movement like in the beginning of the film where the slaves are shown going into the working area at a certain pace and aligned as robots When more people are involved in a scene like the one in which all the children are surrounding Maria as she rings the danger bell the angles are vertical triangular but when only one person is focused there is a closeup to allow us to read that characters expressions and feelings A good example would be the closeups on the master Fredersons eyes as he asks his secretary why his son was allowed to go underground and as well after that scene when he is thinking in order to suggest this dictators meditation and frustration Another important aspect of the camera and of Expressionism that I have remarked was the scene in which the mad scientist tries to run away from Freder and kidnaps Maria He is walking up on the roof of a sharpangled building holding Maria under his arm as if nothing would happen The same scene was notable in Robert Wienes film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari as Cesare walks up on the roof with the kidnapped fiancé and the city crowd follows himTime also is significant in the film because the clock keeps showing up in the most important scenes Time is evident in Fredersons office as his son challenges him to have mercy for the people as well as he is talking to his secretary Still only a small portion of the clock is shown in these shots and it means the time in which the master can think what decisions to take On the other hand a gigantic clock is shown as Freder finds an exhausted worker trying to turn a wallclock Freder understands the struggle of this man and replaces him There is where he finds out that at  pm Maria will have a meetingBut all that we have seen in this movie is not only made to show us the great importance of this silent SF film that can keep the watcher alive by its impressive music and can inspire contemporary movies like Matrix  but for its great historical importance Fritz Lang expressed a social life in this movie as well as a political one After WWI when Germany had lost a war peoples lives were a disaster Everyone was disoriented and could not keep up with the tragedy that was going on and maybe there were some influences of the great antiSemitism that was supposed to follow But Germany was a great disaster as well and there was nothing it could have done to prevent it because many troubles kept adding up over the years and this country had to be defeated morally and politically as well as economically Even if Germanys wish of reconstruction was as utopic as Fredersens wish of a technological city the postwar inflation had a big contribution on cinemas development,0
1189,tt0017136,I typically dont like silent films but I decided to watch this one for two reasons  First I usually like scifi movies and second Metropolis had received so many glowing reviews that I couldnt pass it up  However my opinion of this film is below what most reviewers have been sayingKinos digitally remastered version on DVD is very impressive  The sound and picture quality are both excellent  However I have to conclude that favorable reviews of this film are likely based on nostalgia on the films influence on future films and on the incredible visual effects given its year of release  Film history buffs and silent film fans should see this movie  I thought this was a good film but not a great one  A rating of  is much too high and at # there are plenty of better films ranked below itFirst the good parts of the film  The special effects are excellent for a pres film  The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work the decisions they make and in how easily they are led/misled  The main character is well developed throughout the film and the audience can relate to him well  The film is visually stunning and impressive  The story of the working class vision of the future machinemen etc have had a very strong influence on many films which came later,4
1190,tt0017136,For its time this movie has stunning visuals kind of Kubrickesqe in appearance especially the opening scenes of workers going and coming from work Its very strange with the group leaving walking with their heads down like zombiesThe set designs in here are also something that might draw your attention This really has a futuristic look I thought the visuals were fascinating This was German expressionist filmwork at its height I would think Director Fritz Lang went on to become a very famous man in his profession This wasnt his first effort but I think this might have been the film that put him on the map so to speak Several years later he gained a lot more fame with M At any rate with the photography sets and overall Flash Gordontype scifi look this must have been a real eyeopener to movies viewers  years ago I still think they look very cool today The music was also very dramatic at least in this restored  surround sound restoration DVD put out by KlinoObviously the eye makeup on men and the exaggerated motions by actors in silent films look a little hokey but I was mesmerized by Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and her evil clone She is something else! I also appreciated Klinos explanation of lost footage and how they did the best they could do to still make the story flow together They did an outstanding job I wouldnt attempt to watch this on anything less than this DVD which looks pretty darn goodThis is a worker story about a man wanting to trade his comfortable life to join the oppressed workers who do their thing beneath the earth in Metropolis Workers are seen as nothing but replaceable robots If someone gets hurt they get carted away and replaced immediately but some other zombielike human Of course people being mistreated can only take it for so long before rebellion Thats history from the days of the Jewish slaves in Egypt to today so thats part of this story too I wont say more to ruin itI dont want to mislead people on one major point todays audiences watching this Few people in  watch silent movies To ask them to sit through two hours of a silent film is obviously asking a lot I had to break this up into several viewings myself but thats okay I still enjoyed itbut it a silent movie this long is not easy to sit through You have to be a student of film or a big film buff to watch thisbut those people will be rewarded Over  reviews in here show you this film has enough to offer or at least take a look Now that this restored version is available check it out!,7
1191,tt0017136,OK first of all Im not some kind of actionjunkie who thinks that the Rambotrilogy is the best movies of all time I am a person who think that other silents like Nosferatu and The Battleship Potemkin are entertainingAlthough I loved the previous movies referred to I thought this was one of the most dull movies ever As entertainment this movie cant go very far On a scale rating its abilities to entertain it gets a / from meAs a milestone in the history of movies it goes all the way to the top The special effects were great to have been made almost  years ago The editing was great It must have been one of the most expensive movie made to that date On the scale of how important a chapter in the cinematic history this is I will rate it a / That means a total / This also means that you should rather check out really good silents like Chaplins Modern Times Eisensteins The Battleship Potemkin and Murnaus Nosferatu,8
1192,tt0017136,Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium and his  opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format a fully restored print on the KINO DVD filled with intertitles to keep the story complete that had me appreciate it more but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music ie Giorgio Moroders experimental cut it would still be affecting At the core of the story Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou the sides of good vs evil or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak is set up so strongly that even when it has its fairytale type of heaviness to it it doesnt seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults This is the kind of film that should work for anyone young and old as it deals with universal themes ie The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!The story leaves room for the visual style to come through Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis Joh Frederson He feels the sorrow and pain of the people and goes down to their level to be one of them He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women Maria played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm in multiple roles she plays without a fault who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freders father Enter the robot a marvel of a mad scientist who gets transposed from Maria and becomes the havocwrecker of the part of Metropolis I wont reveal too much of the story except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lapAmidst in all of this Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects cameratricks and of course editing if I wouldnt quite rank Metropolis in my alltime top ten favorites I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day cars moving on roads built to the sky airplanes flying everywhich way and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways But its not just the use of the models or the sets or the backdrops or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Langs shots which are all spectacular its also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene it also appears in other scenes I think Its little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages the superimpositions of faces and eyes in the dreamlike shotsAnd of course Langs greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story he goes beyond his time period in stylizing As I mentioned with the pacing being unique it was surprising though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M that many of the suspense sequences mob scenes/riots chases I knew that this is the same kind of styling thats used today for many of the most modern of sciencefiction/action films In its own way much like Stanley Kubricks  Space Oddysey it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling while not completely abandoning the storytelling form Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries and it hasnt been seen in its full form in almost eighty years what remains doesnt seem at all dated or crude Quite the opposite its visual expressiveness its use of time and character and action and its deliberate pacing makes it ahead of its time and influential and at the same time keeping itself unique Its a tale were all familiar with being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial cruel world which Im sure was even more relevant to post WW Germany at the time filmed with a mix of overthetop melodrama megabudget setpieces and designs that confound the senses Add the appropriate music and youve got a classic fantasy A tremendous film to see two three a dozen times over though some of those too impatient for films without spoken words or by the operatic dramatic side of it all may become disappointed or frustrated,10
1193,tt0017136,For many years the initially flopped and consequently butchered Metropolis Fritz Lang made in the mid twenties of the past century could be appreciated at least for its qualities as the indispensable sciencefiction trailblazer in motion picture history What was severely lacking from the plot however finally emerged on screen again after the famous Buenos Aires reel find which brought a quarter of what was missing from the film back from the dead With the new painstaking  restoration effort also came a grandiose symphony orchestra studio recording of the original Gottfried Huppertz score  and the results make movie buffs prone to be blown away and this time for realThe technical brilliance and visual lavishness of Fritz Langs oeuvre was always undisputed already at its time and only matched by fellow German Murnaus ingenious approaches on filmmaking Theres so much and dense imagery that generations of future filmmakers would draw from this newly emerging archetype Among the unforgettable scenes are the giant heart machine which turns into a moloch in one of the heros visions the Babel tower teeming with utopian life the enormous sets elevators and masses and masses of enslaved and rebellious people the staggering creation of the first robot all set against the dominant dichotomy between  literally  those living above and those dying below There are echoes of communism here of nazi ideology of the dangers and abysses of industrialization technology and there are also glimpses of humanity Not perfect in all its components the film nevertheless has everything pioneering in it  and more Fritz Lang while having some reservations himself referred to the picture as a signpost for new destinations and thats exactly what it became now that we can look at the great scifi pictures of the past century In them and through them Metropolis still lives and once we revisit the original again we might yet be surprised that it miraculously still points ahead,10
1194,tt0017925,Probably Buster Keatons best film and oddly enough its not even a straightforward comedy  its actually an action film with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure  `The General which is set during the Civil War is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray Buster Keaton of course who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army    and is turned down because the army feels hed be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier  However through a series of misunderstandings both Johnnys family and his girl think hes a coward and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier  Months pass and Johnny sad and alone is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North  Johnnys efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girls love  become an unbelievably funny and actionpacked series of events as Johnny tries to go from being a sadsack buffoon to being a heroIf you havent watched many silent films they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive as hes fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye  While funny Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well  His timing whether for a joke or for a tender moment is absolutely impeccableWhats also great about `The General is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldnt be made today  No amount of insurance would cover it  Keaton does all his own stunts and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General with a bike he sits on a moving cattlecatcher knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own  All these stunts are fantastic but its scary to think that any one of these probably couldve killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong  ,9
1195,tt0017925,Buster Keaton once said that if he hadnt been a comedian he might have been a civil engineer He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics Its no wonder he adored trains the most elegant of machines and brought them into his movies whenever he could When one of Keatons former gagwriters loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this page of history to life His first certainty was that the production had to be so authentic it hurts He even insisted on using historically accurate narrowgauge railroad tracks which he found along with appropriate landscapes near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove OregonMost importantly the area had stretches of parallel tracks which allowed scenes of Buster on his trainagilely scrambling over the cars balancing on the roof to scan the horizon chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind himto be filmed from another train running alongside Buster his train and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Busters hair while smoky pinecovered hills rise and fall around him These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures and they put to shame all later backprojection and process shots models and computergenerated effects The quality of Keatons filmmaking is simplypun intendedunparalleled Every shot in The General is clean fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times The film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional just like the grave masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniformsThe Generals narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look Like a train it stays on track never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline Adapting the historical incident Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train Johnnie Gray rather than one of the raiders As he saw immediately The General is one long chase or rather two chases structured like the flight of a boomerang First Johnnie on a borrowed train the Texas chases his own stolen train the General He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines pursued by the raiders in the Texas who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high commandThe General is not Keatons funniest film but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs A number of the gags like the boxcar that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks have a long buildup for a relatively modest payoff But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings The cannon attached to the back of Busters train goes off just as the train starts around a curve so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders train coming out of the curve Riding on the cowcatcher Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his trains wheels so lost in thought he doesnt notice when the train starts to move carrying him up and down in gentle arcs stillness in motionI agree with author Jim Kline who describes The General as Keatons most personal film the one that best captures his unique vision spirit and personality In many of his films Buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero But his competent ingenious and athletic character in The General who is also modest tireless and underestimated comes much closer to his real nature There is a shot in The General of Busters eye isolated on screen framed by a hole in a white tablecloth that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertovs kinoglaz the cameraeye Keaton melds with his camera; theres no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies They have the same silence the same strictness the same strange blend of gravity and humorThe General might be the most serious comedy every made but its not a tragicomedy That as in Chaplins blending of pathos and low humor was something people took to immediately But no one knew what to make of The General Original reviews accused the film of being dull pretentious unoriginal and unfunny Even today people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing The General is challenging because it doesnt flaunt its virtues; like Keatons concise and economical performance it holds a great deal in reserve Take the movies most famous shot of a train crashing through a burning bridge for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film he doesnt dwell on it or hype it Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience never manipulates never overplays He doesnt show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents nor does he play for sympathy Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold But for those who can see the expressiveness of Busters socalled stone face who get his peculiar dry humor who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated Buster Keaton always has more than hes showing; you can see it in his eyes,10
1196,tt0017925,It is generally or should I pun and say General Lee? said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keatons career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past but getting the correct rolling stock costumes weapons and props to make it look correct And it worked so well that Keaton never really could despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR outdo it In fact the closest thing to his best sound film or film that he influenced that was a sound film was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE where he returned to a Civil War themeTHE GENERAL as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE is based on the Andrews Raiders stealing of the Confederate locomotive The General and an attached train which was used to damage tracks and bridges The raid in February  was from northern Georgia into Tennesee It only lasted  miles as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial Others went to southern prisoner of war camps The effect of the incident far outstripped its military success The damage after all could be repaired But like Jimmy Doolittles Raid over Tokyo in April  it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky/Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhileDespite it being a brief incident of the war the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south When Lesney did it famous series of Models of Yesteryear the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was The GeneralThe story however was ultimately a downer But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period First he changes the viewers perspective  it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men but on the Confederates Secondly he builds up the story of Johnny Gray a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier Because Keatons family and girl friend Marion Mack see he is not enlisted they believe he turned cowardJohnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake the General from the raiders and the film has actually two chases in it  first Andrews and his men stealing the train and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking itAlong the way are many comic classic moments such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train or when at a moment of dejection Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase and finding Marion Mack there helping him are wonderful  especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired she throws away the ugly little ones Keatons reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful momentThe classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river and the burning of the railroad bridge with its destruction of a second locomotive It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history By the way the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest He was Mike Turkey Strut Donlin a frequent member and starring player of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the th Century Donlin who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases left baseball to become a film actor he had worked a bit in vaudeville Keaton was a sports fan and showed this in his film COLLEGE where he shows his abilities in several sports and hired Donlin This was the latters most famous performance  look at his reaction to the collapseIt must be regarded as Keatons finest film and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures,10
1197,tt0017925,No one will top Keaton for physical risk and risk is what deep film experiences are all about This might be classed as a comedy but for me it touches deeply enough Its about a man who needs to prove himself by taking risks and being true And its by a man who takes even greater risks and is more true True to the spirit of the social compact here displayed as the chummy southHes always done stunts that amaze Many of his other films have things in them that if the timing were only a little off hed be seriously injured or die But this takes the cake Its almost as if he started with the idea that hed have three locos to play with and had a year to think up stunts And the stunts are so physical! And so dangerous And so so very effective His trademark is the deadpan face placed as a sort of innocent cluelessness Its particularly funny when you see the physical movements and you know that  they take incredible preparation and timing to pull off and  the fellow you see that looks so puzzled by the reality you see is the guy that devised and directed those stuntsTeds Evaluation   of  Worth watching,0
1198,tt0017925,I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number # on the  version of AFIs Top  Movies of all time list It didnt make the cut at all for the original compilation in  so even before seeing the picture I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion I usually line up with the majority in most cases but I have to admit I dont quite get it with this picture I found it entertaining enough on occasion but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way its heralded on the DVD sleeve I dont think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy so right there my expectations were greatly reduced Keatons somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition dont help On the flip side I wouldnt have expected slapstick to move the story along either so at least I wasnt disappointed in that regardWhat I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity When Johnnie Gray Keaton dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army and pondered his situation while sitting on the trains connecting rod the resulting visual was pure genius The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnies thoughtful reverie and was one of the highlights of the picture for meThe other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge For starters I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb  unbelievableOh yes and I cant forget the sequence where Keatons marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a preCGI world its difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own For that Keaton deserves accoladesIn between all this clever film making however I just wasnt inspired The central plot element doesnt hold up for me  if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer why wasnt he simply told the reason why One could argue that then you wouldnt have a picture but for me it left the story on a shaky footing If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier the picture might have taken a different approach but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero Maybe Im second guessing a master but thats what I come away withConclusion  if this movie didnt make AFIs Top  Film List in  I dont understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top  At the same time Chaplins City Lights in my estimation a superior silent film fell OFF the list while The Gold Rush moved up a few notches I may not be a professional but I know what I like and this one just didnt do it for me,7
1199,tt0017925,Buster Keatons The General about a man and his engine puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen From major comic situations to throwaway gags The General always knows what to doThe story begins in leisurely fashion A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray Keaton has two loves in his life his engine and his girlrespectively The General and Annabelle Lee Marion Mack Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle followed by two engineerworshipping boys and unknown to him Annabelle Lee herself He and his entourage arrive at the door; Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs slicks back his hair and gently taps the door with the door knocker Then he turns to notice Annabelle Keatons understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness Any other comedian would have done an explosive doubletakeNow Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor but the boys are there too Johnnie stands up puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave The heroworshippers are ready to follow but Johnnie lets them out first then closes the door on them This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pantsNow the two are alone Annabelles father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon the War Between the States has begun Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist then turns expectantly to Johnnie who cocks his head like a confused puppy She asks Arent you going to enlist? Realization hits him and he leaps off the seat Before he can run out the door Annabelle kisses him This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porchJohnnie races to the general store which is now a makeshift recruitment office Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation but the man rejects him Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer Later Annabelle believes that Johnnie didnt even try to enlist She refuses to speak to him again until hes in uniform What follows is a classic moment Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine Hes so miserable that he doesnt notice when he starts moving up and down until just before the train enters a tunnelTime passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General When nearly everyone is off the train having dinner the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine Annabelle a passenger herself was still on board She is now their prisonerBut Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen possibly by deserters He pursues the engine by taking another The Texas Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas but the Unionists think theyre outnumbered and continue to run What follows is the true joy of the movie two long chases separated by an important plot twist Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop actionI love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas At one point the car which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track reappears in front of the baffled engineer only to disappear later just as mysteriously We see the logical circumstances that lead to the cars seeming magic act and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied preventing him from seeing what we seeComic logic is important to The General In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable In a throwaway gag Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for itWe move to the second chase where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle LeeMarion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was She has hilarious moments The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire She takes a small stick and daintily puts it in Johnnie sarcastically hands her a sliver and she puts that in too Then in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping Johnnie grabs her and halfthrottles her before kissing her insteadThe final section most of it a battle scene includes the shot where The Texas begins to cross a burning bridge only to crash into the river Owing to Keatons disdain of fakery one of several reasons his works seem modern he did not use a model but a real train on a real burning bridge The crash cost $reportedly making it the single most expensive shot ever in a silent filmA worthy closing gag was too taxing even for Keatons ingenuity Johnnies dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers His remedy is only mildly funny Is anyone complaining? The General is a work of art and a work of genius,0
1200,tt0017925,This film flopped when it was released in late  for several reasons First its premiere was delayed because Flesh and the Devil was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks Second people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian not Buster the filmmaker and director which is more of the role he played here The film was funny but it was not gag after gag like so many of Keatons other films Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South A title card declares he has two loves  his girl and his engine when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession His girlfriend misunderstands thinks him a coward and says she wont speak to him again until he is in uniformMeanwhile the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Busters train Unknown to Buster his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train still without the knowledge of his girls captivity by the Union armyForgotten with the arrival of sound the film revived  often cut up from its original length  in the s because Buster didnt preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today often with poor video and hideous musical accompanimentToday The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too SHERLOCK JR is clever OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious The General is both of these things Its story driven races to a climax and is fueled by cute clever inventive gagsBuster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in A Southern Yankee,9
1201,tt0017925,One of the great masterpieces of cinema Buster Keatons The General combines inventive humor with terrific action and fine melodrama all beautifully and carefully planned and photographed  It is filled with subtle and wonderful details that make it well worth devoting your full attention to watching  As an extra bonus it offers a fascinating look at the Civil War era with many realistic details inspired by a historical incidentAfter a short opening sequence the movie divides nicely into two halves Johnny Keaton is a railway engineer turned down in his attempts to enlist in the Confederate Army and subsequently rejected by his girl  Continuing with the railroad one day his locomotive is stolen by Union spies who also kidnap his girl  Johnny first chases the engine into Union territory to recapture it and then is himself chased by the Northern Army as he attempts to return home  Both chases are filled with excitement and manic fun with some breathtaking stunts by Keaton thrown in  It all leads up to a dramatic and memorable climax that includes many ironic and suggestive touchesKeaton is at his best with the story offering him a perfect showcase for his many talents  His slapstick and acrobatic skills are given free rein and his characters stoic perseverance is a fine complement to the frantic actionThis belongs near the top of any list of great films a classic worth watching and rewatching,0
1202,tt0017925,I havent had so much fun watching a movie for a long time The General is a silent comedy mostly slapstick about Johnny Gray a train engineer with two loves his engine and Annabelle Lee Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer Things are then sped up a year where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan As it so happens they steal Johnnys engine a big mistakeBuster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies but of course less old He is often ignorant of what is going on around him leading to plenty of laughs This also makes him a very charismatic characterThere are countless train related jokes The first one comes right at the beginning when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman in a line much like a train The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment The finale is explosiveThe General was a lot of fun to watch It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies and had plenty of substance on top of that This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever After my first viewing it instantly became one of my favorites It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies,10
1203,tt0017925,THE GENERAL represents the greatest achievement screen comedy ever accomplished From the brilliant gag construction to the sheer excellence of the filmmaking technique THE GENERAL is a hilarious and amazing journey into comedy Written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman Keaton brings brilliant gags into the story The film begins when Keaton is told he is of no use to the South as a soldier but as a train engineer However his girlfriend refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform After the war has started the girl is kidnapped by some Union raiders on Keatons train and so begins the greatest and funniest chase ever filmed For the next  minutes the viewer is in Keatons world His gags routines and amazing slapstick serve to make this the greatest screen comedy ever filmedMatt age ,0
1204,tt0017925,Ive seen one other silent movie in my life but it was Mel Brookss The Silent Movie so I dont know if it really counts I really enjoyed The General overall more than I thought I would as someone who was born after The GodfatherThe main thing that surprised me was the fact that I couldnt look down to write very many notes; any time I took my eyes off the screen I ran a serious risk of missing something It seems to me that the film even though it was long or seemed so it was very dense in terms of action I imagine that since the movie has no dialogue the filmmakers must make up for it by making it as visually interesting and entertaining as possible I am accustomed to more modern movies with snappy dialogue and special effects and suchmovies in which you can look down at your popcorn or kiss your date and not miss too much because you can hear pretty much whats happening This was a nice change for meObviously Ive never seen a Buster Keaton film and Im not even sure if Id heard of him before this class But I can see why he is so appealing in his films I loved his facial expressions particularly the stoicbutcrestfallen look in his eyes on the train when something else goes wrong He also has great control of his body as we discussed in class and a fine sense of comic timingI found the film surprisingly funny Many modern films that I think are funny eg Austin Powers Toy Story American Beauty rely largely on witty or outrageous dialogue for their humor As a silent film The General must rely mainly on images for its humorthe slapstick images of Johnnie falling over constantly the unusual image of Johnnie riding up and down on the crossbar between the train wheels the stereotype exploitation in the scene when the girl sweeps out the locomotive Im sure that some of the things that I considered amusing might not have been considered funny by the original audience such as the recordscratch lightning bolts,0

1206,tt0017925,THE GENERAL When one watches for the first time the General great things happen laughter relief a neverending smileand that old sniff of old good cinema I must admit not many films out there give the pleasure this one has It is like everything just falls right into place Overall the movie is a perfect account of all the things that make comedy great Simplicity good and twisted plot a sense of the unexpected becoming more and more realDo you feel me dont you? It has been attributed to Chalie Chaplin the following sentence to make a comedy film you only need three things a park a woman and a police officer We can safely say The General stands up to it Well there is no park in The General although the landscape is used wisely but theres a woman As for the police officerwell not exactly What we do have in the film are soldiers Im afraid of telling you the plot of the story because I dont want to spoil anything I reckon itd be better if you find it out for yourselves Well lets just say that Buster Keaton plays the main character an engineer whose beloved locomotive has been stolen by Union spies From that point on he does everything in his power to get it back Theres nothing more for me to say butEnjoy yourselves!!,8
1207,tt0017925,To watch The General is to be both awed and amused at what takes place The consensus view is correct This is an amazing movieYou know whats more amazing? Despite what most critics say Buster Keaton made funnier better films than thisKeaton a lifelong railroad buff is engineer Johnny Gray captain of The General a locomotive which carries passengers and freight across the American South When the Civil War breaks out he tries to enlist and thus please his girl Annabelle Lee Marion Mack but the authorities deem him more useful running trains When Union spies seize the General with an idea of using it to burn bridges and disrupt the Confederate supply line its up to Gray to save the dayNew York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall reviewed The General back in  and expressed disappointment This is by no means so good as Mr Keatons previous efforts he wrote People cite Halls review as a classic example of whatdocriticsknow but the more I read the more I agreed with him The fun is not exactly plentiful he wrote noting Keaton here was too much the acrobat too little the clownWhen I watched The General I felt disappointment too Like Halls it wasnt total; its exciting and inventive and boasts some of the finest screen compositions Ive ever seen The technical expertise on display is astounding Its just that the overall experience left me a bit flatFirst you have what Roger Ebert liked to call the idiot plot Gray tries to enlist and is rejected by the army because hes too valuable as a train engineer Annabelle apparently never learns this for she rejects him as a coward I dont want you to speak to me again until youre in uniform she huffsEither hes an idiot for not explaining the truth of the matter or shes an idiot for preferring her lover be cannon fodder than a real asset to their cause Anyway Buster does manage to make this play later on When he finally speaks to her he is in uniform an enemy uniformThe other main issue involves what Lincoln called the slows A lot of the story is literally trainwatching Buster does some brave amazing stuntwork and throws in some clever gags later joined by Mack whos no Sibil Seely but still quite game but its basically a lot of watching trains go by The craft here is in the precision of the camerawork and the splitsecond timing not so much the comedy In fact except for Buster himself everyone plays it completely straight probably because this is real history being presented Compared to other Keaton comedies it feels a bit straitjacketed by thatThe General is still a solid thrill comedy with some amusing one liners If you lose this war dont blame me Johnny yells after being rejected and brilliant sight gags like the fussy Annabelles rejection of unattractive firewood while Buster struggles to stoke the engineTo me thats enough for The General to be another good reason for loving Buster Keaton I just cant understand it being the preeminent reason Maybe critics cant really love a comedy for just making you laugh and laugh Im just glad Keaton made other movies at least as brilliant as The General and funnier too,7
1208,tt0017925,Buster Keaton s performance in The General was purely enjoyable The story takes place during the civil war on centers on Johnnie Gray Keaton a train operator in the South Johnnie is not accepted for service in the confederate army because of his value on the railroad and suffers the shame of being home while the other men are fighting a war When his beloved engine is hijacked by Union soldiers the unpredictable story goes into overdrive Johnnies adventure includes train chases rescuing the love of his life a daring escape and a climactic battle This film has a distinct action/adventure aspect but at its core it is a brilliant comedy/drama Keatons performance is superb He has the ability to effortlessly change your mood and the mood of the film with his facial expressions and physical comedy Keatons character seems to make endless mistakes that work for the best and good decisions in dangerous situations It is easy to imagine Keaton as a major influence for a future comedians and I personally felt like I was watching the Mel Brooks of a previous generation The General was a fun film to watch with a true star Buster Keaton turning in a timeless heartfelt performance,7
1209,tt0017925,When watching The General  the similarities between Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin are almost unmistakable The story was original and humorous and the performance by Buster Keaton was pleasing What I didnt like was the fact that the protagonist still was pursuing the girl who was so quick to leave him when she thought he wasnt brave and then ends up staying with her at the end He is too good for her I thought the stunt where the bridge gives out and the train falls was very well done and must have cost a fortune There were scenes where I found myself laughing out loud and scenes where I was bored So unfortunately the film doesnt do a great job at keeping the viewer glued to the screen but overall it was enjoyable,7
1210,tt0017925,I feel the The General is a great silent film because even though the story line is relatively complicated the way in which each character played their part and the way it was filmed made it easy to follow I am fairly new to the silent film experience and when I saw that this movie was partially a comedy I was expecting something more along the lines of Charlie Chaplin however I was pleasantly surprised at Buster Keatons more subtle comedic style I felt that the film was well shot shot considering the technology of the day I was actually shocked during the scene where the Rock River Bridge collapsed under The Texas Knowing full well it was not special effects I couldnt believe the producers would spare the expense of destroying a locomotive and an entire bridge This movie is sure to be one of my favorite silent films,7
1211,tt0017925,Buster Keaton always amazes me He was truly one of the most hilarious deadpan screen clowns of early cinema And The General even clocking in at around three hours is surprisingly watchable based on his physical performance aloneGranted I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything thats unnecessary but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments There are multiple points in the General a story about a Southern engineer that has to rescue his beloved from the clutches of the North in the Civil War where Keatons character Johnnie Gray has to stop his train jump out and remove something from the tracks which in itself can be quite boring but the way that Keaton injects physical comedy into those moments keeps me entertainedAnd its a marvel how so many realistic yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with Its nothing fantastic like some of his other films but its still funny And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversitybut he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and its just enough to know that he is frightened but that the rest of him doesnt react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny Whether hes pratfalling due to surprise or erroneously succeeding at something hes unskilled in and being shocked by it that response of his is winningBut the General does show its age a little It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesnt get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context I wouldnt dare cut those moments out of this film even if I could reedit it because the space always had something going on but at the same time this film if made today would be cut to oneandahalf or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly The plot and story are simple but exist more than to just help the comedy move alongexcept at the end when the first story was accomplished Then we move into a second extraneous but still amusing story regarding a battle between the North and the South that couldve been excised and still having a decent though simple storyI didnt really love the score that the DVD company attached to it which is a number of classical pieces end on end I think a new commissioned soundtrack wouldve better matched the piece but I guess we get what we get And on the plus side you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of itIs it perfect? No But despite the age it shows it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinemas greatest physical comedians If you want to spend three hours with a silent clown this is not a bad way to go /,8
1212,tt0017925,Have a lot of appreciation for comedy especially the witty and sophisticated kinds and there are a good deal of classic comedies that go for the broad approach too Am significantly less keen though on the vulgar puerile style of humour that is seen quite a lot today the worst of it veering on the offensive There are many instances of silent films/comedies seen with Charlie Chaplin prime Laurel and Hardy and with Buster KeatonKeaton is seen as one of the greats by many but for some reason doesnt seem to be quite as well known even with a just as good reputation critically as Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy who transitioned better into sound maybe when at his best in the s an extraordinary period with a deservedly lauded reputation he was every bit as great as funny and as likeable His daring physical comedy and stoic deadpan expressions were unique and ahead of its time at the time and still amaze and are distinct now plus he was a bigger risktaker with bolder material and immense courage that most wish they could have Which perhaps hasnt been more apparent than in this film The General often considered one of his best and most important films or even his masterpiece though with other just as worthy efforts it has been debated and justifiably so This paragraph is very subjective of course and probably wont be agreed with but that is just my respectful stanceThe General to this day still looks great and remarkably lavish something of a technical achievement in its day It also should be used as an example of how to have effects that still look good and like a lot of effort and care went into them and also use them properly rather than overusing and abusing them to gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now The locomotive features heavily here and to ingenious and quite imaginative effect The direction keeps the momentum going with ease and balances all The Generals elements every bit as adeptlyWhen it comes to the humour which is very physical it is never less than very funny and is timed inventively throughout no corniness at all and it gels very well But The General is much more than just a comedy and one can say that its not really one It has other elements too and executes them even better actually especially the action the scope dexterity and boldness of it and especially those stunts absolutely jawdropping and truly exciting to watch It is also an example of how to have action that thrills while being easy on the eyes coherent and not being too noisy or busy something to learn fromAlso here is a tender understated quality that is very surprising and the romantic element is genuinely charming without being sappy The film also has a story thats easy to follow and at the same time is logical and interesting indicating a film with brains as well as soul that treats the viewer with respect rather than getting irritated by credibility straining and logic lapses Keaton is superb here not only is his comic timing on point but he provides a character thats endearing and worth rooting for His physicality and how he copes with the stunts is aweinspiring and he is one of not many to make deadpan interesting and entertaining because he still makes it very expressive and nuanced The rest of the cast are easy to overlook but are just as strong even if with not as much to do or with material that sticks in the mind as muchOverall brilliant and a Buster Keaton essential / Bethany Cox,10
1213,tt0017925,There are some truly wonderful scenes in this film which is full of adventure comedy and some pretty impressive stuntwork on moving trains by Buster Keaton and the other actors The premise is that Keaton a train conductor has volunteered to fight for the South at the outset of the Civil War but been turned down When his train is stolen by Union soldiers he immediately gives chase on foot then a handcar briefly a bicycle and then finally another train not knowing quite yet that his girlfriend Marion Mack was inadvertently also kidnappedIn one of the memorable early scenes Keaton is sitting on the connecting rod of the locomotive lost in thought when it starts up bobbing him up and down In another he packs a cannon on his train with a massive charge and as its angle slowly descends before firing it appears hes going to blow himself up until his train at the last minute hits a curve and he nearly hits his intended target Its just wonderful There is also of course the scene with a Union train going out onto a burning bridge which then collapses one of the most iconic and expensive scenes of the eraIn addition to those big moments there are also innumerable little things Keaton does which highlight his genius He is just so lovable and talented He uses one of the large railroad ties intended to derail him to knock another off the track as his train is moving When hes hiding under a table surrounded by Union officers hes subtly kicked and jostled in funny ways As he makes his escape with Mack he stuffs her into a large sack that he had emptied of shoes only to lose his own shoe in the process and struggle to locate it I also thought I saw bits of Woody Allen in the scene where he urges her to be quiet only to knock things over and make noise himselfAmbitious aweinspiring influential clever and still funny + years later Is it the best ever? I dont know I liked The Cameraman  even more but still – damn good,9
1214,tt0017925,Buster Keaton is Johnnie Gray a southerner who wants to fight for the cause but gets rejected because he could be of more use as an engineer than as a soldier Unfortunately hes not told why he was turned down and his gal just assumes that hes a coward Not so because when a Yankee scallywag steals his beloved steam engine the titular The General Johnnie heads north to recover the engine and through a series of misadventures becomes a hero of the Confederacy and rescues Annabelle Lee Glorious sight gags abound as Old Stone Face deals with errant cannon loose sword blades uncooperative firewood inexplicable soakings and a lessthanhelpful rescuee not to mention an entire army of bluebellies Great fun from another era and a wonderful example of the silent genre,8
1215,tt0017925,Buster Keaton plays the lead in this silent era masterpiece that takes its inspiration from the Great Locomotive Chase which in turn was a real event during the American Civil War in which a train was stolen by the North and sped over the lines in preparation for the coming offenseThe General has some definitive upsides working in its favour Buster Keaton is an amazingly versatile performer able to go from clownish jokester to a saddened victim of war and poor circumstances in a heartbeat The film is also really ambitious in scope Keaton performs all of his stunts most of them hairraisingly dangerous and completely unimaginable nowadays Plus very little money is spared and the film famously has some of the most expensive set pieces and stunts of the silent eraThe plot of the film is also a lot more cohesive than say in the films made by Charlie Chaplin in the same decade Chaplins films usually contain segments that have little to do with anything except the need for funny situations The General is also a comedy but with a clear clean story arcOn the other hand I didnt find the humour or the characters as captivating Theyre okay but in this regard the decades of cultural development between the film and yours truly work against the film I just didnt find the slapstick all that funnyStill The General is a great watch for all interested in early cinema or really involved physical humour,0
1216,tt0017925,The General is one of the great films and treasures of the silent era Its among the best movies of the talented comedy actor Buster Keaton In this film Keaton shows the athletic ability and courage that made him one of the best of the early comedians who performed their own stunts His physical antics on and off his train The General support his title as king of comedy stunts All the silent era comedy actors seemed to have lots of energy And many had daring courage and even madness at times Those were the actors who did all or most of their own stunts While there were some stunt men around in the early s it wasnt until the last of the silent years and dawn of sound pictures that stuntmen were a regular part of the cast of films that required any amount of derringdo And while a small number of actors today will still do some of their own stunts nothing can compare to the actors of old who performed their own highrisk and dangerous stunts – and sometimes those for other actors The five best early actors at doing stunts were Buster Keaton Douglas Fairbanks Sr Harold Lloyd Tom Mix and Yakima Canutt The latter two specialized in Westerns and besides acting and doing stunt work Mix and Canutt regularly rode and performed in the rodeo circuit Lloyd was versatile in his venues but excelled at high stunts on buildings and sometimes with wild animals Fairbanks excelled in swashbuckler stunts sliding down the sails of ships swinging from anything hanging aloft and jumping with the help of trampolines into windows Keaton was even more versatile As a child actor in vaudeville Keaton learned how to fall to avoid injury He called his technique soft falls or landings But even with his training and practice his film roles with derringdo often left him bruised at the least At other times he had suffered injuries from slight to serious Still he had become known for his physical resiliency During the filming of The General in  Keaton was knocked unconscious by canon fire He suffered a broken ankle while filming the  short The Electric House And he broke his neck during the  shooting of Sherlock Jr but didnt know it until years later This movie has an interesting plot set during the US Civil War It opens with a scene and script that reads The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marietta Georgia in the spring of  The train seems to be traveling about  miles per hour But the film is almost entirely about action and the comedy in the action involving the train There is an element of romance The cast all are very good The photography is superb Much of the action with trains is filmed in Westcentral Oregon from Eugene to Cottage Grove Theres no information about sound at all so I assume the music we hear with the film is soundtrack that was added for modern viewing It probably is meant to replicate the piano accompaniment that was usual with silent films in theaters of the day This is one instance when I think the piano playing would have been better The music seems to go overboard at times This is one of the early great films from the silent era that showcase the talent and early mastery of moviemaking skills Its a fun movie with strong visuals that even a modern family of all ages should enjoy,10
1217,tt0017925,Johnnie Gray a train engineer tries to enlist in the Confederate Army to impress his girlfriend Unfortunately he is rejected because his role as engineer is deemed more important Lucky for Gray he is given the opportunity to prove himself when a band of Union soldiers in disguise hijack a trainAt the time of this films release it was a flop and considered to be not very funny Since then it has gone on to be declared one of the greatest films of all time Funny how that works I would tend to agree that it isnt really very funny but it is a great film for a variety of reasonsBuster Keaton was an amazing actor and director He was willing to put himself in dangerous situations for a laugh  he was his own stuntman right there when the train falls in the water really sitting on the side of a moving train and on the front of it he could have been killed And this was captured on film flawlesslyPersonally I enjoyed his Sherlock Jr better I thought the tricks were better and the action funnier It had a faster pace too that kept me hooked enough to watch it a few times The General was not boring but as a silent film it could have done more to grab the audience and Im not sure that it did,7
1218,tt0021749,If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend as others have pointed to in the past City Lights is the one Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies like Modern Times and The Gold Rush City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest his bravest his most romantic and his most sympathetic Its tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters but its pulled off The film centers on three characters the Tramp the quintessential funny homeless man who blends into the crowd but gets caught in predicaments He helps a drunken businessman Myers a fine performance in his own right from suicide and becomes his on and off again friend that is when it suits him and doesnt notice his friends state The other person in the Tramps life is the Blind Flower Girl Virginia Cherrill one of the most absorbing beautiful and key female performances in silent film who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money which leads to a how else can I put it magical boxing match where its basically a  from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull Though there is no dialog the film achieves a timelessness its essentially a tale of two loners who find each other lose each other and find each other again the last scene widely discussed by critics for decades is moving if not tearinducing And its never ever boring once you get along with the Tramp you find the little things about him the reaction shots the little things he does after the usual big gag look to the ballroom scene for examples of this or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing Truth be told if this film makes you indifferent never watch Chaplin again But if you give yourself to the film you may find its one of the most charming from the era or perhaps any era,10
1219,tt0021749,Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplins City Lights a masterpiece Its only  minutes long but they are among the best  minutes you could spend at the movies and the last five minutes are simply exquisite Keep your Kleenex box at arms length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says Yes I can see now the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanationChaplin was at his zenith in  when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story and the Little Tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade He had already made the classics The Gold Rush  and The Circus  starring his character so its obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time The advent of talkies didnt stop Chaplin from making this Comedy Romance in Pantomime as he subtitled it as he knew giving the Little Tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character What I particularly enjoyed in this film is how the Little Tramp fancies himself as a wellmannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down even going to prison for love It is this selfdelusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl played in an effectively plaintive manner by Virginia Cherrill Her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable Simply compare her to the screen test shown of Georgia Hale Chaplins leading lady in The Gold Rush and an obviously more experienced actress than Cherrill as Hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the Little Tramp is the wealthy gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sightOf course this would not be a Chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes  the rising and lowering of the street elevator the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers and was according to the footage included as a DVD extra inspired by an earlier Chaplin short The Champion from  Even a simple moment for example when the Little Tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment And special mention needs to go to Chaplins musical score where he beautifully interweaves José Padillas La Violetta as his love themeThe transfer to DVD is very good and the DVD set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality The Serge Bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film and the footage of Chaplin from a Vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the longforgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then The aforementioned Georgia Hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long The minute home movie of Chaplins trip to Bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise Regardless the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies Chaplins reputation as one of the worlds leading filmmakers,10
1220,tt0021749,This is my favorite Chaplin film but I dont want that to diminish his other work either MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick and even the largelyneglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone Chaplin didnt make a bad movie and Im not even sure that CL is his best exactly But it IS my favorite if only for the endingThat ending has been the subject of much comment here I think its a masterpiece in a single scene Chaplins little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living breathing human being Its a monument to understated sentimentalityTo me the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid Yes the boxing scene is great and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful but its that ending that makes us all love this movie,0
1221,tt0021749,Once again Chaplin plays his famous creation the beloved Tramp The noble Little Fellow meets and falls in love with a blind flower girl She assumes he is wealthy man and offers him a flower which he attentively accepts with his last penny One night by chance he rescues a drunken millionaire from drowning The rich gentleman becomes a generous friend when drunk but doesnt recognize the tramp when sober Chaplin takes the blind girl under his wing and takes flight with the millionaires money to cure her blindness City Lights engaged a true genius in a graceful and touching performance which arouses profound feelings and joy with great simplicity of style and tragic tale Each scene was the result of hardworking detail and planning,9
1222,tt0021749,Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights and the results are spectacular The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights and even though Charlies performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant City Lights is so well made that it is one of the very few movies in which the obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked Yes you can clearly see the string holding Chaplin up in the sidesplittingly funny boxing scene but who cares? That is such classic slapstick that little things like that really dont matter Besides lets keep in mind that this movie was made seventy years ago Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk His friendship with the drunken rich guy is hilarious but it also makes a significant comment about the problems of alcohol This is truly a great film which should not be forgotten,10
1223,tt0021749,Charlie Chaplins City Lights contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it  Although made very much in the oldfashioned silent film tradition much of it is timeless tooAfter a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning Charlies little tramp character makes two acquaintances  He meets a blind girl selling flowers who mistakes him for a rich man and the two become very fond of each other Then he meets a real millionaire who is drunk depressed and about to commit suicide  In a comic scene the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it making himself a devoted friendThe tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight and tries to think of some way he could help  His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades  his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny and one of Chaplins best comic pieces Meanwhile when his millionaire friend is drunk he dotes on the tramp but when sober he forgets who the tramp is leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for CharlieAll of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the bestremembered scenes in any film  City Lights shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master who without words can move his audience or make them laugh  Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once,0
1224,tt0021749,Film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia  Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are  Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation  We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new  In City Lights and other silent works of film a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere  While watching the film I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story the sets the crew; the whole project  While this may not have been the complete reality it felt that way and thus made the film more enjoyable  In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional responseSince film is at its very core a visual medium I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium  I dont use the word basic here in a demeaning sense but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance  Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced but they were and are beautiful  The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic There is a warmth found in City Lights and other Chaplin films The Kid Modern Times that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today  Maybe its just that with simplicity comes honesty and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer,0
1225,tt0021749,City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of filmmaking Chaplins last silent film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the mans wealth to make her fall in love with him The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesnt recognize the tramp anymore On top of this the flower girl has to pay  dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forthThe outcome of the movie is to almost all people known It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film The movie itself still is masterpiece more than  years after its release I personally rate this as Chaplins second best I have seen so far My favorite remains The Gold Rush Still this movie gets / stars from me,9
1226,tt0021749,I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplins nicest most underappreciated silent movie gems Then I discovered it really wasnt underrated; its rated very high on most critics lists It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this onePart of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that Im a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one Its a romance between Charlies tramp character no name and a blind girl who also had no name in this film Virginia Cherill who played the blind woman and had a wholesome pretty face which I found very attractiveIm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as talkies were out in full force by  Chaplin was at his best in silent movies anyway and his comedy routines are legendary He gave me a lot of laughs in this film as always and I particularly laughed I love slapstick at the boxing scene Kudos too to Harry Myers as the eccentric millionaireTheres a lot of drama as well as humor in this minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sightComedy romance drama with suffering all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment Its hard to believe this movie was not up for one single Academy Award,9
1227,tt0021749,CITY LIGHTS United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  l is a silent comedydrama released at the height of the sound era Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad Chaplin gambled with this production and made it pay off Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH  as the one movie he would most want to be remembered CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time practically places his other silent masterpiece THE CIRCUS  to oblivion CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama but in Chaplins case pathosSubtitled A comedy romance in pantomime the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city After the unveiling the crowd finds a little tramp Charlie Chaplin sleeping on the lap of one of the figures As he tries to climb down he encounters one problem after another This opening scene alone is priceless With such a great beginning Chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot The theme to CITY LIGHTS is remembered mainly about a tramps love for a blind girl However there is a subplot involving the tramps involvement with a millionaire drunk which by far takes up more time than the sentimental love story These two segments actually set the pattern First segment set in the afternoon finds Charlie walking down the street examining a nude statue in a shop being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing He encounters a beautiful blonde girl Virginia Cherrill selling flowers After she drops one of her flowers Charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it thus realizing shes blind Smitten by her beauty he picks it up and pays her for it Minutes later the slamming of a limousine door is heard with the girl believing the kind gentleman Charlie to be a millionaire Second segment set at night finds Charlie encountering a drunk Harry Myers trying to commit suicide by drowning himself Just as Charlie is about to save him he in turn falls into the river The drunk in gratitude for saving his life takes Charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn By morning the millionaire now sober fails to recognize or remember Charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion This running gag thats repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious but Chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges By day Charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when shes not at her usual corner selling flowers Finding that shes ill and being cared by her grandmother Florence Lee whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction Charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs ranging from streetcleaning to fighting in a boxing match Reading in a newspaper of a European doctor who restores sight for the blind Charlie gives the girl $ for an operation the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire who after sober accuses Charlie of robbing him has his arrested and serving jail time The climatic finish is truly the best thing Chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missedFeatured in the supporting cast are Henry Bergman Allan Garcia Albert Austin and Hank Mann While much has been discussed about Chaplins performance his costar Virginia Cherrill as the blind girl no name given should not go without mention Even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor Cary Grant her performance is excellent by all means Although its been said that future film star Jean Harlow  appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence she is visible in a surviving still photograph but no such scene appears in the finished product Unlike THE GOLD RUSH CITY LIGHTS had limited showings in revival houses in later years and was never allowed to be distributed to television Being first introduced to CITY LIGHTS at New York Citys revival movie house The Regency Theater formerly located on Broadway and th Street in  the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience There was one man probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film No doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else Watching CITY LIGHTS surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in After Chaplins death in December of  CITY LIGHTS along with his other silent features were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure but became readily available on video cassette at the time of Chaplins th birthday  In later years CITY LIGHTS was frequently revived on various cable channels ranging from Turner Network Television TNT in the early s American Movie Classics up to  and finally Turner Classic Movies The complete musical soundtrack that accompanies CITY LIGHTS happens to be the original score composed to perfection by Chaplin himself Much has been written and said about CITY LIGHTS over the years To learn more about the making difficulties and long term preparations to CITY LIGHTS either watch Kevin Blownlows  documentary Hollywood A Celebration of the American Silent Film as narrated by James Mason or Brownlows other documentaries dedicated entirely to Chaplins career including outtakes to CITY LIGHTS as well as scenes involving Virginia Cherrills temporary replacement Georgia Hale Chaplins costar in THE GOLD RUSH ****,10
1228,tt0021749,Spoilers hereinFor me this film falls not into the category of favorite films Im a Marx brothers kind of guy but earns instead a place on a very short list of most important moviesThats because it has two features that I truly appreciateIt is as pure a vision of its creator as is possible Nearly all other films are engineered from prior work Not so with a small list of projects from Welles Kurosawa Eisenstein  and this one project of Chaplins They are wholly original springing from some nether worldBut the other element is the one that impresses the most This film is about itself about the art of visual narrative Chaplin was intelligent enough to know that what he was doing was new The issues are centered on what the audience `sees so while he struggles with what and how the audience sees he builds that into the fabric of the storyThe primary framing is about the blind girl who falls in love with him by `seeing him in her own way Then `sees him at the end in a different way The rich man recognizes the tramp when drunk but does not when he is not Nearly all the jokes indeed every element of the film is about this same dynamic the elevator which is not seen but then was the burglars the same the Tramp on the statue on the barrel Even seeing the cigar before the bum does Even us seeing the soap and the foreman notThe `seeing is carried over to `hearing with the politician and whistle jokes And then even further as Charlie turns his back on the new technology of giving us speech and instead `shows us something else he writes and conducts an amazing score instead This is truly amazing and one reason to take Mike Figgis seriouslyNo wonder Orson Welles considered this the most important film ever made But as to the best to watch? Because film is so derivative my own gold standard for the Tramp is Robert Downeys and to some extent Depps Comic timing is something that evolves and those men make a more effective Tramp for my modern ability to seeTrivia Chaplin found the `blind girl in a group of spectators at a fight and was struck with how her expressions reflected what she saw Shes pretty as well of course but certainly not the prettiest Chaplin knew See how Chaplin separately works in both the fight a performance and her reaction to his performance in the film,0
1229,tt0021749,Waddling along with his cane and derby hat and that tiny mustache the little tramp Charles Chaplin is visually unlike any character in film history The tramp is kindhearted always dignified Hes a simple soul who in City Lights tries to help out a young blind woman well played by Virginia Cherrill This is a silent film of course but the tramps body language is his speechThe really noticeable feature of the tramp character is how he blends into everyday life Hes more or less ignored by many laughed at by others The girls grandmother never sees him at all And only when the millionaire is drunk does he see the tramp as a friend Curious  and deepThe tramp gets into his fair share of trouble but only through his bumbling efforts to help the girl The boxing match is a hoot and very well choreographed as are all the skits And what a beginning for a film with city leaders spouting gibberish probably as Chaplins dig at the talkies Then the way Chaplin makes his grand entrance  just terrific!Melancholy at times the films music really tugs at your heartstrings Maybe its sentimental and manipulative But given the abiding and Zenlike qualities of the tramp some sentimentality is quite appropriate And the music is choreographed totally in sync with the plot actionProduction design is sparse and at times drab That the film was made during the Great Depression is beyond obviousComedy here is simple and effective The main character expresses heart and humanity The little tramp is an unforgettable character And City Lights is a wonderful film,10
1230,tt0021749,Chaplin was a unique presence in the history of the early cinema  Coming up through the ranks he gradually achieved a godlike stature being awarded total control of every facet of the productionNot only was he often the sole person who knew what the end product was to be as in The Kid but he was also allowed to elaborately improvise in the creative process  This often meant doing countless scores of retakes over days weeks and even months; holding up the cast and crew for days while he brooded over just what to do next; and even in the case of The Gold Rush cancelling expensive weeks of location shooting and returning to the studio to start all over againHe cleverly duped chief studio and bank chiefs into somehow going along with his freewheeling and gross inclinations thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hitandmiss schemes and trialanderror madnessIn other words Chaplin used the entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush with which he toyed at his pleasure to create his personal canvases  Fortunately he was a genius and at the right place in time to be allowed to get away with such unprecedented extravagenceIt was a young and growing industry when Chaplin began emerging and there were no set rules  People were still trying to figure out just what could be done with the medium  and Chaplin helped to establish its early parametersHe was certainly and autocrat yet that doesnt really matter when it comes to film works  Its the product that counts  In the case of City Lights all the bloodsweatandtears that it took to achieve the finished product was more than worth the effort  Now that all the frustration anger and outrage associated with the behindthescenes unfoldment of this highly troubled production are well in the past what remains is a genuinely moving film classic,10
1231,tt0021749,The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one The first fulllength talkies were released in  By  theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business By  silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism But in  a new silent picture was released that far from being an embarrassing failure became the fourthhighest grossing picture of the year being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy The picture was City Lights and its producer writer director editor composer and star was Mr Charlie ChaplinChaplin was of course primarily a comedian and his humour was of broad appeal but audiences of the time were not exactly starved of easy comedy The Marx Brothers were making great strides on the verbal quipping front and the everpopular Laurel and Hardy had made a successful transition to sound What makes Charlie stand out and what gave him a level of accessibility that allowed him to continue with his slapstick antics well into the sound era is his equal devotion to story which allowed him a scope for social commentary empathetic characterisation and deep poignancy Of all Chaplins silent pictures City Lights is probably his least memorable in the funny stakes The number of classic gags here is fairly small Not since The Kid a decade earlier has Chaplin given story so much precedence City Lights is riddled with coincidence and plot contrivance but its a tale of such beauty and sincerity that this does not matter Within this story the comedy becomes functional often serving to puncture a schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone Ironically it is the occasional forays into slapstick that help keep City Lights realAs if to snub the talkie City Lights is a remarkable achievement in complex visual narrative even only occasionally relying upon title cards and then often only as an embellishment to the more comedydriven moments Most plot points and character traits are implied rather than stated which gives the picture a continual smoothness – another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad to see the back of the intrusive title card Out of necessity Chaplins technical approach is more overt than his usual He often cuts to a closeup to give us a necessary reaction and there are even some whippans in the scene where he and the flower girl first meet but all of this is in keeping with the rhythm and tone of the picture Those whip pans after all reflect an abrupt emotional moment and are in no way a blatant or showy manoeuvreBut what really makes City Lights work what makes it connect is the man himself on the screen Those additional closeups once a rarity for a man who acted mainly with his body now show off a capability for intense facial acting An older more meditative Chaplin may have been keeping the traditions of silent cinema alive but his own career trajectory was entering new ground where emotional expression was increasingly intimate and personal The result is profoundly moving,10
1232,tt0021749,City Lights is a different film from what I am used to seeing I have not watched a Silent film or pantomime in a few years I really enjoyed the story that Charles Chaplin helped to create and produce for our enjoyment The plot seems to be commonly used now with a boy falling in love and trying to win the girls love in return In City Lights there are a few twists to the plot The girl is blind and poor the TrampChaplinis poor in love and wants to help the blind girl The Millionaire can help the tramp out by giving him money but he is an onagain offagain friend depending on whether or not he is drunkBeing that this is a silent film there is more importance on the use of props and the acting of the character Since in a silent film they cant tell us how they are feeling it is important that we can understand feelings through action This may be through facial expressions body language dress eye contact kinds of touch or the use of written statements like title cards in a silent film A prop that stood out to me was the use of flowers From the flower girl selling her flowers to how Chaplin was always holding or smelling one of the flowers from his special girl the use of flowers helped show the emotions and feelings of the two characters It symbolized the affection he had for her because like the flowers she couldnt see she couldnt see the true him or his true affections Another prop that was used was money From the millionaires point of view money was really of no matter He threw a party just because he had been reunited with his friend he went out to the dance club and when Chaplin needed money in order to help the flower girl pay for rent and surgery he was willing to give him one thousand dollars To the millionaire this money is nothing but to Chaplin and the flower girl this is a showing forth of love and charity When the movie was made in the s many people were poor and hopeless but the portrayal of Chaplin as a poor but happy and hopeful man might have given hope to others who watched this movie during the Depression In the film I noticed the use of a repetition or rather a parallelism as was read in the Film Art book dealing with The Wizard of Oz They show shots one way in Kansas and then reverse the shot in Oz as I saw in City Lights In City Lights parallelism is done with sight not necessarily with eyes but with the mind We see the reverse where the poor blind girl sees Chaplin as a millionaire and then at the end she sees him as the tramp he is with her new eyesight The true reverse is emphasized because she is now working in a shop and making money The two characters are somehow always at perceived opposite ends of the social class spectrum yet he still has a desire for her to be happy because of his love Another reverse is the happy friendly drunk millionaire who sees Chaplin as his friend and hero for stopping him from committing suicide However when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him throws him out and even has him arrestedIn a way this film is different then what our generation might be used to but by watching these classics we can better learn where the movies we love today came from and gain a better appreciation for the art of film,7
1233,tt0021749,The tramp tries to nurture and help a blind flower girl regain sight despite scant resources and the prejudices and graft of the big city Although the physical gags lack the largescale invention of the factory scenes in Modern Times and the criticism of the wealthy doesnt transcend an admittedly witty recurring jokethe aristocrat friend can only demonstrate compassion and friendliness in an inebriated state; hes always inviting the tramp in only to incredulously throw him out the next sober morningthe tramps touching earnestness in rescuing his angel from a life of abjection is simple and selfless and deeply moving I would say it also fades out at the perfect moment of openended ambiguitythe viewer is forced to make resonant meaning out of the final troublingly cathartic shot even as the film articulates a consistent worldview in relation to what has come before In my eyes Modern Times is Chaplins masterpiece but City Lights would probably better merit repeat viewings which is as much a testament to the films power as anything else,8
1234,tt0021749,City Lights is probably one of the most well loved along with Modern Times Chaplin movies The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp one of the most lovable truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps like they are labeled lazy and troublesome It is very hard to hate The Tramp because he gives so much when he has so little He spends his time and money giving to people  whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl Undoubtedly we all have a little bit of The Tramp in usThe plot is as follows the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street She is poor and by a mere coincidence believes that The Tramp is rich He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide and despite his gratefulness doesnt remember the poor tramp unless he is drunkCity Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history Its poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy I believe it is a strong mixture of both and a great balance of the two Both comedic and touching City Lights should not be missed by anyone,8
1235,tt0021749, its perhaps a test of a persons outlook to ask them what they see in the final scene If theyve never seen City Lights before and they instantly notice the major continuity issue Chaplin holds a flower to his lapel from the rear shot its up to his mouth on his close up then maybe theyve placed film studies over romanceIt took a few viewings before I spotted this and once I did I cant help but notice it Yet even despite this I never fail to get choked up on the beauty of that final scene If you want to impress the right kind of girl put it on and show her what a sensitive soul you are during those final momentsAs for the rest of the film then while the final five minutes are classic and perhaps the best thing Chaplin ever did the rest of it is episodic and patchy necessitating my relatively low score Still a fine film but never a completely great one what presages those beautiful final moments is merely fine entertainment,7
1236,tt0021749,If i have to choose which movie have the best ending it is very easy to choose city lights it is very very easy Chaplin was genius seriously genius This is the movie that truly inspire me After i watch city lights i just know there is such a movie power that exist in this world that can move and touch me really deep I never feel such a sharp sensation ever from any hundred movies i watch before and this movie pierce me through the heart within silent only gesture eye contact and cameraworks with no dialoguesometimes i try to analyze deeply why this movie have such a magnificent power i think the reason is the connection between scenes if we ask ourself what makes a good ending ? maybe the answer is how good you make the scene before the ending how good you correlate the prologue and epilogue and also between them how you fill the midduration of a movie if the director took a right decision a movie will not have any wasted scenes its only genius filmmaker can do and chaplin is one of themsilent movie such as city light is a hardkind of movie to made it needs next level of acting skill from the actors and actresses because there are no dialogue in it and most of the duration this movie is flawless in casting and the ending scene were unbelievable and unpredictable maximum genuine artbeauty of silent moviei recommend everybody to watch this movie at least once this movie is special it definitely will pierce you,10
1237,tt0021749,As always the little tramp is fleeing the long arm of the law when he is mistaken for a wealthy man by a blind girl selling flowers by the roadside While he longs to help her the tramp knows he cannot However when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon a drunken man who he helps out who may be able to help him in turn  if the two of them can sober up long enoughIn response to seeing some modern trash posing as comedies recently Little Man Norbit Pluto Nash  Im looking at you I decided to check out some comedies that have stood the test of time  a few Chaplin films being among them City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start As was often the case this film has a thin narrative but one that allows for several scenarios for Chaplin to work his magic And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole filmThe statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at His support do no more than that  support him  but yet they are also roundly good Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character while Myers Garcia Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside ChaplinCity Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent setpieces that tickle and also stick in the mind So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead,0
1238,tt0021749,Do you really need to post a spoiler warning for a movie that as of tonight is  years old?I havent read other reviews so forgive me if I repeat any previous postings City Lights is with nary a doubt the greatest love story ever told Forget Casablanca Forget An Affair to Remember Forget Love Story For the love of Christ forget Love Story This is a movie about the purest loveWe have the simple ubiquitous Tramp He is smitten with a blind flower girl who has mistaken him for a wealthy man There is a new operation that cures blindness and the Tramp will do anything to help Flower Girl regain her sight He tries to win a boxing match in which he is clearly outclassed In an era that is forgotten in modern times pun gleefully intended he cleans the streets of dung One of the best sight gags in screen history happens when the Tramp has to clean up after an elephant Finally he steals from a wealthy man to get the money he needs to pay for Flower Girls operationAnd then after he has spent many years in prison the Tramp is reunited with Flower GirlMy fellow males this is a wonderful Chick Flick If your lady friend isnt reduced to tears by the last  minutes of this movie you need to find a new lady Ive seen it a dozen times and it always gets to me,0
1239,tt0021749,Four years into sound Charlie Chaplin wrote performed directed and scored one of films finest masterpiecesThe story is about the Little Tramp befriending a blind woman who mistakenly thinks he is rich Along the way he manages to get into a series of unintentional fixes with a large cast of foils at his disposal as he struggles to finance an operation for the womanIn an incredible display of comic talent Chaplin bombards the audience with scene after scene of magnificently choreographed comedy Drunk dancing or boxing his graceful slapstick is a rare combination of comedy and beauty a comic ballet Chaplins performing artistry as well as his ideas reach their apex with City Lights where only Chaplin would dare to challenge the naturally progressive trend and technological status quo by daring to make a silent By pulling it off with aplomb he solidified his place atop the history of the profession Some sound is used sparingly brilliantly with a statue dedication and a piano keyboard but no intelligible words are uttered The track and Chaplins score is lyrical energized and integral The film is perfectly constructedIn the masterful hands of Chaplin he avoids bathos in his scenes with the blind woman by severing the sentimentality and the scene with a comic moment saving it all for the incredibly touching and moving finale Up until then it is a display of comic genius that only a handful of others might lay claim to,10
1240,tt0021749,As much as I loved The Kid The Gold Rush Modern Times and The Great Dictator City Lights is the film I consider Charlie Chaplins masterpiece And there are several reasons why this is so for meI love how City Lights is filmed once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets The music is also a delightthough my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times with plenty of themes that stuck in my head while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand The comedy is brilliantly done the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin moviealong with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator but ever in a comedy while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girlplayed touchingly by Virginia Cherrill he falls in love with And I also found the closeup climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity Chaplin is superb his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with CherrillOverall yet another Chaplin masterpiece yet for me this is the best of them all / Bethany Cox,10
1241,tt0021749,Charlie Chaplin made some extremely funny shorts but of his longer films this is one of the best along with The Gold Rush and Modern Times Two stories are woven together One is Charlies onagain offagain friendship with a wealthy drunk The guy has a case of multiple personality When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts When hes sober he doesnt recognize Charlie at allThe second story involves a pretty blind flower girl who given certain distances angles and lighting resembles Uma Thurman Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballsCharlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy hes sober and wont support Charlies story Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel broke and bitter he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands The happy endingTheres sentimentality in the story of course There often is in Chaplins later films But as usual its somehow tempered Here its undercut by ironyWhen Charlie meets the wealthy toff the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope Hes about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes gives him a pep talk and changes his mind His spirit revived the rich guy spread his arms to the sky dropping the boulder that falls on Charlies footAnd when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl shes enthralled by his gentleness Unseen by her the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain himself enraptured Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlies face Well its not the blind Mr Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W C Fields general store but what is? A note There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film not counting the DempseyTunney debacle but I dont think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed hereIts hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this Black and white and silent Applause please,8
1242,tt0021749,City Lights  **** out of Charlie Chaplin returns as The Tramp and this time he falls in love with a blind girl Virginia Cherrill and sets out to help her The Tramp eventually meets a suicidal drunk Harry Myers and their friendship leads to what might eventually help the girl he lovesChaplin made great films before and after CITY LIGHTS but for my money this here is his greatest film as well as one of the greatest films ever made Not only is it one of the funniest movies ever made but Id also argue that its one of the greatest love stories if not the greatest It really says a lot when a movie can conqueror two genres at one time but CITY LIGHTS is simply one of the greatest movies ever madeI think it says a lot that you get one classic scene after another and theres really not a weak spot to be found here Being  it took some real guts for Chaplin to deliver a silent film and I think he knew that he had to deliver something special because people had moved onto sound He certainly delivered something special as this here was easily the funniest film he had made up to this point The opening sequence with the introduction of The Tramp was priceless and we got one hilarious scene after another from that point The scenes with the drunk are downright hilarious as is another scene where The Tramp is trying to eat but without much success The cigar sequence is a masterpiece as is the by the water In fact the story between The Tramp and the drunk would have made a terrific movie on its own Just like the stuff with The Tramp and the blind girl would have made a perfect film Whats so special is that you get both stories wrapped up in one and it really deliversChaplin played The Tramp countless times but he was never better than he is here Just check out the timing in countless scenes including the boxing match and you cant help but be impressed with the actor Myers also deserves a lot of credit as the drunk as his timing has to match that of Chaplin throughout and the two men do a wonderful job together Then youve got Cherrill who wasnt a professional actor but the director makes her shine throughoutCITY LIGHTS contains one great scene after another and all of the laughs lead up to one of the most powerful endings in film history Theres really not enough great things that can be said about this film as it continues to get better with each passing year,0
1243,tt0022100,Fritz Langs highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement and ended in the United States in  with the production of The Big Heat a film noir classic Perhaps his greatest film M Germany  forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones Even though M was Langs and Germanys first sound film many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late s While most early talkies return films to their static visually monotonous stage imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium M avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous offscreen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue The films editing particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling Of course many of the films sound effects are also imaginative and memorable none more so than the compulsive whistling of the films central character the stalker and serial killer of little girls Hans Beckert magnificently played by Peter Lorre Sound is also an important contributor to Ms rich and influential use of off screen space One famous example is the scene that introduces Beckert as a shadow against his own Wanted poster creepily intoning to his next victim Elsie Beckmann You have a very pretty ball Not only is Beckerts shadow a bow toward Langs expressionist artistic roots but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image  that is among us the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuousappearing albeit monstrous member Another example of Langs use of offscreen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is Elsies absence from them an empty chair at the Beckmann dinner table the vertiginous stairwell down which Elsies mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughters arrival the attic play area that awaits Elsies return from school Most memorable of all  and most often alluded to visually in other films  is the series of shots that indirectly record Beckerts assault and murder of the innocent child representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of Elsies ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame Never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated imagesBeyond its technical brilliance the keys to Ms lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of Hans Beckerts twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and trial Unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer Beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath Nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clearcut To be sure the gutreaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry capture Beckert and bring him to a mock formal trial whose conclusion is foregone Like many in America today Beckerts accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the monster in the surest way possible a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible Considering the heinousness of Beckerts crimes and the imperfections of a legal/medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again this emotional response is hard to resist Yet M is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism  quite the contrary Through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of Beckerts unkempt court appointed defense attorney and Beckerts own impassioned monologue Lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others guilty or not in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding Nazism in s Germany That the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks dresses and gestures like a Gestapo officer is no accident Moreover the letter M chalked on Beckerts back by one of his pursuers not only stands for murderer but also alludes to Gods marking of Cain While the popular misconception holds that the mark of Cain symbolizes his evil it in fact represents Gods warning to Cains flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance but to leave justice in Gods hands Translated into secular terms and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame Gods hands in M belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try Hans Beckert in the name of the Law,10

1245,tt0022100,M is a monumental film and seriously should be watched by all For a film like this to be made in  is just shocking Even if the film was released today it would still be nothing like we have seen before In our modern age of film making there has been a considerable rise in the production of films about serial killers their complexities and particularly about pathological ones Yet M is the first movie that comes to my mind when I think of the themes that have been in Psycho Silence of the Lambs Seven and not to mention countless moreThe film is lead by Peter Lorre in a transcending performance who plays the serial killer and rapist in which the film is centered around In this performance Lorre is successful in something that at the very least is rare to see in any kind of film compassion for a child killer and rapist Lorre makes the viewer see that he is not a criminal by choice but by a sickness of compulsion Too often then not is our perception of a psychotic killer having that look that puts fear into his or hers victims eyes Lorre doesnt do that but rather displays a frightened man a scared man One in which his desperation leads to his hazardous behavior His portrayal of a killer is not of a fearless one but of one consumed by fear Something that even today we as a people cannot understand let alone in The direction and writing of Fritz Lang is beyond comprehensible as he taps into the mind of a serial killer and his complexities He does so in such that we get an empathetic and compassionate illustration of all sides of the story This in which by then end of the film all points of view are more then well delivered to the audience Fritz Lang here has simply created here a timeless masterpiece One that excels in its technical aspects and enlightens the audience on a topic that other films still have not yet to match M inI highly recommend this film for many obvious reasons and conclusions This film was created by one of the all time great directors in Fritz Lang Langs command for the screen is mesmerizing and a joy to witness and so on and so forth Yet much of this is mostly superficial and a waste of time to continuously state M as I mentioned before takes a strong and original stance on an issue that we as a society yet have not fully resolved This film may not give you THE answer on this issue but it may sway that moral compass of yours that lies inside of all of us,10
1246,tt0022100,The economy austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound and precise filmmakers Lang a master of the German expressionist film shot his first talkie a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies It was a shocking idea for its time based on the reallife killer Peter Kurten headlined as the Vampire of DüsseldorfM is about a terrorized city and a plump little man with wide eyes often chewing candy who is a pathological childkiller unable to control his urge for killing The film embodies several Lang themes the duality between justice and revenge mob hysteria the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in and for probably the first time in the cinema it adds a new dimension to suspense pity For the killer is clearly mentally sick He cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease and yet we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal rather than treated as a sick man Early in the film the killer is heard whistling the Grieg theme from In the Hall of the Mountain King This theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace And when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window the melody on the soundtrack told us chillingly that the murderer is there just out of sightThe Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since Casablanca The Maltese Falcon and The Mask of Dimitrios When the photographs of his victims all little girls are shown to him he jumps back and twitches with horrorWith powerful visuals Langs motion picture is Lorres first film His performance as the corpulent hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion Lorre is the archetypal outsideroutside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal He had only twelve lines of dialogIn the most famous of all about a pathological killer  Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho  Anthony Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy Psycho reeked with blood and horror whereas the suspense of M is subtle A childs balloon without an owner a rolling ball are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed The audience trapped in its seats torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight,8
1247,tt0022100,The first time I saw M by Fritz Lang I almost didnt know what to make of it I was overwhelmed by the power of the performances the staging of the scenes the locations and the power that the simple story had with such complex circumstances Then I saw it again and a third time and I know that this is one of the best films ever to come out of Germany its a powerful statement about protecting our children if youre looking at it as a message movie but in reality it is just a piece of cinema heaven Thrillers today only wish they could draw a viewer into the mystery elements and have such unconventionality of the times Boiling down to this M is about a child Killer  the legendary character actor Peter Lorre in his first major role  who snatches children when their parents dont watch and continues on until an investigation goes underway But as the police investigate overly thoroughly into the real criminal underworld they know something is up that this is someone far more gone than they could ever be so they join in the hunt This all leads to one of the supreme dramatic climaxes in any thrillerOn the first viewing I just went straight for the story which is able to suck one in enough to make you feel dizzy But on the multiple viewings it becomes even more interesting as one can study the intricacy and indeed fullon artistry of Langs camera He puts it in unusual places at times and adds for good measure shades of dark and gray in many of the night scene this is by the way a precursor to filmnoir which Lang later became an important director in the s and s On top of this there is a very modern sense of style in the editing I remember a couple of scenes that surprised me editing wise One is where the cops I think it was the cops have an argument about the investigation two of them get into a shouting match and we get medium closeups of them going back and forth This is done quickly with a kind of intensity that isnt even captured in todays thrillers There is also the hunt for Lorre in the digging of the house where Lang cuts around constantly heightening the tension between the predators the criminals and the prey Lorre until its almost too much to takeThe disturbing aspects of the story of child abduction and murder have become benchmarks of a number of todays thrillers where the cop is usually the subject and the killer left more in the shadows in cat &amp; mouse style This doesnt happen here and because of it by the time we get to the final scene with Lorre being interrogated and giving his I cant help it speech it becomes something poetic tragic frightening Lang doesnt leave his message so simplistically he makes sure we know Lorres side too however twisted it has become and the antagonist is shown as human as opposed to these presentday thriller where the killers are barely given one dimension let alone two There were reports that during filming Lang put Lorre through torture ultimately causing the two to never work together again But nevertheless out of this comes a towering performance of a small wildeyed criminal in the midst of an extremely welltold and unpredictable mystery story In short if you dont know what youre in for when you hear that whistle those several infamous notes you may not at all,10
1248,tt0022100,The opening scene of this movie is the first clue to its near perfection  A mother preparing dinner for her child waiting anxiously for her to return from school  Her hope and then distress as she hears people pass outside her door  While down in the streets of Berlin her daughter is receiving a balloon from a strange man in a long black coat  We know whats going to happen but its still horrific to watchFritz Lang you cinematic god!  A simple story of the underworld the police and a single man holding an entire city hostage and done with such precision and prenoir darkness that is oozes creepy suspense from beginning to endBut this movie is not so simple as the police inspectors trying to catch a devious murderer  its about the mob employing its network of beggars and petty thieves also trying to bring the killer to their own brand of justice Apparently the police crackdown caused by the murders is bad for business  so the mob begins to track him down as wellIts not only a great crime story and perhaps the first physiological thriller the murderer is schizophrenic but theres comments to be made here about the nature of justice and who should best dispense itIn all not only a trailblazing classic but THE trailblazing classic,10
1249,tt0022100,This is a very interesting film on so many levels Its interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture  Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place  what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding Compare it with any American film from  and you cant help but see the differenceThe murderer artfully played by Peter Lorre has been killing children that have no link to him personally for months The police despite all of their efforts are unable to catch him mainly because there is no rhyme or reason in his choice of victims At first there is a focus on the victims and the hole left in their families by their killing Then the film shifts to two normally opposed groups  the police and the underworld After several months of no results by the authorities the police are unhappy because it reflects badly upon them and the underworld is unhappy because their activities are being disrupted because of the police doing constant raids in their efforts to capture the killerIn a particularly welldone part of the film the scene shifts back and forth between a conference of police and one of the underworld They discuss how they are going to catch the killer The police settle upon the idea of looking for people with a history of past mental problems that were pronounced cured and released The underworld decides to enlist an invisible group  the beggars  to follow every child at all times and therefore catch the killer Both groups focus on the right suspect the question is  who gets there first? M is a fascinating film that raises many topics  the death penalty a group of criminals that are criminals by choice causing less stress on society than a lone criminal that acts out of an uncontrollable compulsion and the motivations of the authorities often being their own bureaucratic survival rather than the larger issue of ending a series of horrible acts against humanity,9
1250,tt0022100,Being a huge fan of German Expressionist art Im naturally drawn to the films of Fritz Lang  I recently was able to see the restored version of Metropolis on the big screen and was delighted to see M on the Sundance channel  especially since it was the uncut version  M follows the trail of a child killer Peter Lorre sought both by the police and the members of the underworld whose businesses are being effected by the investigation ,8
1251,tt0022100,This movie is definitely one of the scariest movies Ive ever seen Its about this childlike pity evoking man brilliantly played by Peter Lorre who also happens to be a psychotic child killer The city in which he lives is of course panicked by the mysterious childkillings and both the criminals and the police starts to haunt the man down I wont reveal more then this but I will say this Just because its an old movie dont let your guard down This movie is one of those rare movies which are so good that youll never forget them,10
1252,tt0022100,In an eerie propagandist fashion the phrase in the name of the Law is repeated over the last two scenes of Fritz Langs M as a child killer is brought to justice If L represents the State and the Law then M is meant to represent the Individual who in this case is a Murderer Lang boldly asked us way back in  whose rights come first the State or the Individual? A master of his craft Lang leaves the question openended and lets the audience decideM is shockingly contemporary in its psychological complexities It explores the psychology of individualism vs group think while showcasing how a state of fear can be inflicted upon a populace when a government fails to protect society from a single individual terrorizing the people The story is fairly straightforward An elusive citizen begins killing innocent children in a large nameless German city The media fuels a paranoid frenzy that incites the public The clueless police begin to raid the underworld after the populace is turned into a raving mob because of the failure to capture the killer The underworld comes to a screeching halt as their business is ruined by the police and starts their own manhunt for the killerUnlike a modern period piece that attempts to evoke a certain place and time M WAS a certain place and time Lang in an almost prophetic sense captured the state of mind of the German people in  as the Weimar Republic was on the brink of collapse and the Nazi Regime was preparing to take over When individuals live in a state of fear as they do in M society collapses and the Individual is crushed Only the State it seems can bring orderM is a also a masterpiece for its technical aspects The way in which Lang uses his camera to move through windows capture shadows reflections empty spaces and shift pointsofview is staggering even by todays standards He also played with the new technology of recorded sound with extensive voiceover narration and dialogue used to overlap and transition between scenes Didnt critics recently praise Michael Clayton for utilizing just such a technique as if it was something revolutionary? One can also see a protean style the would eventually birth the Film Noir movement with the creation of tension and suspense in the use of shadows and camera anglesYet M is not perfect It has some major flaws There are no real characters in the film to speak of in the modern sense The film is virtually all built around mood and plot The only time Lang invites us to emotionally connect is in the opening and closing scenes with a mother of one of the victims and in the classic scene of Peter Lorre giving his writhing and primal I cant help it! speech in front of the kangaroo court of criminals The mothers grief and Lorres madness are presented so sparsely and in such a raw form that it becomes too painful to want to connect with them Another flaw that is often overstated about films from this time period is the slow pace of the early police procedural scenes These inherent flaws combined with the inherent brilliance of Langs vision make M one of the most challenging films a modern viewer could ever sit throughWhat impressed me most about M was the subtlety of the symbolism Lang created with his haunting images As harrowing as the story is none of the gruesomeness is shown on screen Its all transmitted to the viewer through the power of suggestion Is it any wonder Hitler wanted Fritz Lang for his propaganda machine which thankfully led to Lang fleeing to America? Ill never forget the wide shots of the kangaroo court and the looks on those peoples faces as the killer is brought down the steps for trial or the vast expanse of that empty warehouse The scene of the ball rolling in the grass with no one to catch it the balloon caught in the telephone wires and the empty domestic spaces the mother has to inhabit after her child has been murdered are the types of scenes that tape into Jungian archetypes and shared fears The look on Lorres face as he confesses the hand of the Law coming down to save Lorre from being lynched and the ghastly plea from the mother in the final scene will stick with me for the rest of my life M is a communal nightmare; one that from which we have yet to awake,10
1253,tt0022100,This is one of those movies that will stay with you for the rest of your life  The characters are ugly and disturbing there is nothing cute in this movieThere are constant parallelisms drawn between the police and the underworld and the common way in which they operateWe also get to journey into the mind of the madman  If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs you should see this alsoOf course you must be patient enough to deal with subtitles and the fact that this is a very old movie  one of the first talkies  But most viewers will get something out of the dialogue even without knowing the German language,10
1254,tt0022100,Great story with incredible development of ideas and feelings while giving the audience an indepth perspective for each side to an extremely difficult issue to resolve  Every film lover should take the time to see this film for its ingenious style and execution of ideas  Adds a little comedy in interesting ways to help entertain and engage the audience  Acting is incredibly real and heart felt  Dramatic and tender to fit to any interest,0
1255,tt0022100,This movie is so intense and enthralling it doesnt have to hide from even the most amazing Actionmovies But unlike the most actionmovies it really has a story to tell with a very interesting conclusion at the endWhen people talk about Fritz Lang they always talk about Metropolis but I think this is his masterpiece This movie MUST HAVE inspired pretty much every police movie or show ever made Rarely have I rated a movie a  with more confidence than this oneEND OF REVIEW so I dont have anymore lines but they make me write  lines apparently so Im writing this I know a joke ehm well its not a good one so I will quote GEORGE BESTI spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars The rest I just squandered,10
1256,tt0022100,Watching Fritz Langs M is watching the history of cinema unfold before ones eyes Made in the transition period between the silent and sound film this  masterpiece remains fascinating for several reasonsFirst of all the use of sound is impeccable Suffice to say the killer in the movie is caught is through identifying his trademark whistling But the use of voiceover narration was also new at the time and is used here very well first when a mother calls in panic for her missing child and her name echoes across several empty walls Next in a scene in which two detectives elaborate on what theyve done to apprehend the killer and everything they say is matched by an imageSecondly few times has a serial killer been treated with such complexity compassion and straightforwardness in cinema Peter Lorre plays a child murder a man who acts by impulse possibly a schizophrenic He simultaneously evokes horror and pity and hes too distant from the supercool and erudite serial killers of today Lorre plays one Hans Beckert a lonely man with a history of mental illness an ordinary man without any qualities or amazing traitsThirdly its a powerful meditation on vigilantism and crime The police is unable to capture the killer so Berlins underground decides to capture the criminal The police raids are putting them out of business and they resent the fact that a child killer is being sought amidst their ranks The absurdity of bank robbers and card cheaters with a sense of morals is not lost on the filmmakers In a mocktrial at the end these same criminals think they have the authority to sentence the child murder to death But as he tells them if they wanted if they got jobs and worked honestly they could leave their lives of crime; a man whos ordered by voices to kill cant just turn off him impulsesBut above all M is a fascinating exciting thriller Its an intelligent crime story that shows police and criminals working on different sides and with different means to achieve the same purpose If one can laugh at the idea of a criminal union realism should never be a criterion for judging art one cant laugh at the policemen in this movie Inspector Lohmann played by Otto Wernicke is one of most intelligent detectives ever to grace cinema Hes fat hes cranky hes an unlikely hero but hes shrewd he can read a persons personality at a glance hes patient Lang must have liked him too because he used the character and actor in his following crime epic The Testament of Dr Mabuse in which Lohmann shows even greater skillsI knew or at least highly expected that M would be an amazing movie But I didnt imagine a yearold movie would hold up so well in terms of cinematography sound pacing acting structure Few movies achieve such a synthesis of qualities There is no doubt on my mind that M deserves the recognition it continues to receive from film historians,10
1257,tt0022100,In my opinion this is just an OK film Except for some little stylistic tricks there is nothing special The story is OK how it is told is rather weak in some parts its even ridiculous the acting is mostly very weak except for Lorre who you dont see much of anyway and the sound quality is horrible something you cant blame it for but I had to use HEADPHONES on full volume to even understand the words! but switching from sound to silent all the time is very distracting and has no dramatic effect at all even if some say so  the opposite is the case it seems very amateurish The slow pacing is typical for its time And suspense? I dont think so In my opinion the main reasons why this film is so critically acclaimed areA Lorres overacting Whenever overacting has a purpose its critically acclaimed And his acting as a madman is very effective B Id call it heavy look The topic seems heavy and the plot and style seem all too heavy and important You almost want the film to be successful so you search for it in Lorres acting As a justification so to say Im sure you like the film for many other reasons too Some more important reasons maybe But that doesnt mean Im wrong Its a film we want to like and where you dont want to look for the flaws Well long story short I dont think the final result is a success There is too much Average in it and the Great isnt all that great Metropolis Nosferatu Caligari Sunrise I think have all a more stunning look All silent and all made before M Dont get me wrong the cinematography is good and also inventive in little parts but not THAT revolutionary that it deserves the reputation it has Probably the flaws are too big for me to fully appreciate the rest Like every time one said He doesnt leave any marksblah blah I had to laugh He talks with the kids in the middle of the day in the middle of the street he walks along the streets with them he goes into shops buys stuff for them he makes mad gestures in public And then he also whistles this damn song all the time so loud you hear it from three streets away while everyone in the audience knows from beginning on that this will be his doom /,6
1258,tt0022100,While many of the problems of early sound pictures lampooned in Singin in the Rain were more or less myths the early talkies did present a big challenge for filmmakers everywhere Europe however was at an advantage over Hollywood because even though it took them a few years to gain the same access to sound technology films from the US would be screened abroad only six months or so after their first domestic release Thus directors like Fritz Lang were able to witness Hollywoods first faltering steps with sound before giving it a go themselvesIts funny how sceptics dismissed sound as a gimmick because the best early uses of sound were those that treated it as exactly that – a gimmick Lang demonstrates in M that a talkie need not be an entirely new kind of motion picture; sound is merely another layer of technique Rather than getting bogged down in lengthy dialogue scenes Lang keeps his storytelling primarily visual and when he needs lots of expository dialogue he intercuts multiple scenes to keep the pace going This is not to say Lang is trying to ignore sound – in fact he uses it to enhance the picture sometimes having dialogue or other noises take place offscreen to focus us on reactions or causeandeffect Other times he ironically uses completely silence something of course you never get with silent pictures due to the continuous musical score giving a dreadful sense of eerinessAnd thankfully the best elements of Langs method have survived the talkie revolution His visual style is particularly effective here in provoking a chilling disturbing atmosphere Shot compositions with large blank areas give a sense of surreal starkness Characters often stare intensely straight at the camera aggressively drawing the audience into the films world Several times we are even dumped straight into the pointofview of the killer himself The fragmented narrative with its lack of lead characters and impersonal pointbypoint plotting could easily be boring but Lang holds our interest by keeping a dynamic sense of rhythm and telling the bulk of the tale through pure wordless imagery Langs German pictures in common with typical German cinema of the time feature highly melodramatic acting and exaggerated almost comical characters These figures generally suited the fantasies and comicbook stories of Langs silent days but Im not sure they sit so well with the closetohome setting of M Still these characters are somewhat more effective now that they have voices probably because most German screen actors of the day were from a stage background Peter Lorre was a shameless ham but thats what you need to play a psychopath and in any case hes a lot better here than in many of his Hollywood roles Otto Wernicke is also incredibly entertaining in the role of Inspector Karl Fatty Lohmann; again a stagy exaggeration but with some absolutely wonderful gestures and comic timingThere isnt a lot else I can say about M – it is one of those pictures that has been analysed to death – although I doubt any comment other than mine mentions Singin in the Rain in the opening line  While not quite Langs best picture I can think of few directors who made such a smooth transition from silents to talkies and sadly this was his penultimate German picture before the Nazis took over Theres no denying that Lang was wasted in Hollywood He did his best to understand it but by and large it never understood him I say by and large; the renowned Irving Thalberg was reportedly bowled over by M and screened it to many of his writers and directors as inspirational material Had that prestigious and influential producer not died in  the same year Lang began working in Hollywood would things have turned out differently I wonder?,9
1259,tt0022100,Masterpiece is the word most film buffs and historians probably would use to describe this  Fritz Lange film based loosely on the events of a reallife serial killer a few years prior to the film In this movie the killer is Hans Beckert Peter Lorre who lures children to their deathsThough the story is about a child killer the theme of M centers more on societys obsession with the murders From kids playing games to adults going about their everyday lives everyone is on guard suspicious combative and very vindictive For selfish reasons even the petty criminal underworld wants the child killer caught But the police are ineffective and a selfrighteous mob mentality takes over The whole film is really a study in the terrifying psychology of group thinkAs it turns out the killer is less monstrous than pathetic and compulsive Beckert cant help himself Hes a short squatty bugeyed little man who cant control the devil within Lorre was perfect for the role and his acting is flawless and mesmerizing Yes the killings all offscreen are awful But the militant lynchmob mentality is just as scary Beckert is the only individualist in the filmPart silent film and part talkie the B&amp;W visual style of M is wonderfully expressionistic and baroque There are lots of overhead camera shots Background sounds like honking horns and whistles are precursors of major plot pointsWhat strikes me most about this film is its tone I can think of very few films that are so harsh so bitter so malicious so punitive M contains not an ounce of humanism Langs exwife Thea von Harbou a Nazi sympathizer wrote the film just before the rise of Hitler The films angry militant tone thus foreshadows Hitlers Third Reich from  until  Lang himself fled Germany and ended up in the USYour own personal preferences in films will determine whether you consider M to be a masterpiece or overrated or perhaps somewhere in between But individual preferences aside there can be no doubt that M is an important film historically Every person who wishes to be versed in classic films needs to see M at least once,0
1260,tt0022100,A serial killer who favors children Peter Lorre is on the loose in Berlin He is wanted by the police But even worse for him he is wanted by the Berlin underworld who have been targeted falsely by the police for being involved Watch out child killer! There is nothing bad I can say about this film The acting the directing the sound all perfect Many have praised Lang for his use of sound at a time when the practice was just coming into play And rightfully so Whereas other films have sound matching what is on the screen Lang realized he could use the effect to signify what he was not showing including the murderer who has a distinctive whistle Brilliant Not to mention that one key role is a blind beggar a man who cannot appreciate visuals but only sounds he is appropriately the man who can identify the killer! Basing the story loosely off of childmurderers of the day Grossman Haarman and Peter Kürten this is one of the darkest tales set to film up to this point There is no blood and no children are actually seen killed And the killer is relatively reserved compared to his reallife counterparts who were also rapists and cannibals He presents an interesting defense his crimes are less wrong than the crimes of others because he cannot psychologically control himself Or in modern terms not guilty by reason of mental defect Is a child killer less evil than a pickpocket? Is he in some way also a victim?I enjoyed the idea of a unionized underworld I do not know the reality of this as it seemed sort of comic and anticipated such villainous teamups as we might see in comic books But crime was certainly not unheard of and even black market meat existed and I am not sure if I really want to know what that meansMany including reviewer Stanley Kauffmann have noticed the similarity between M and Bertolt Brechts Threepenny Opera Sadly I have not seen Brechts work and cannot comment on the comparison German philosopher Theodor Lessing best known for his work on Jewish selfhatred may even have been an inspiration due to his work on Haarmann But regardless of inspiration Lang is the master here his work stands the test of time and today almost a century later is widely recognized as one of the greatest achievements on film At the least many consider it the alltime greatest German film And rightfully soThere are so many great shots including the socalled inventory shot of the criminal underworlds wares Lang also excelled with the camera angles using knives as frames and getting more than one great mirror shot I should also give credit to cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner who previously worked on Nosferatu and many others  his reputation should be second only to Karl FreundThere is nothing that beats the Criterion release with commentary short films and more I watched the film this way on DVD Perhaps a Bluray release has even more but I would not even know what could be added This disc is packed and a mustown for any film historian or Lang fan,10
1261,tt0022100,Outstanding German expressionist film from Fritz Lang that follows first the police then the underworld as they search for a child killer in Berlin The cinematography is moody and dramatic as the story moves through the poorer sections of the great city and the acting while of a more melodramatic style than is currently popular is very good* Peter Lorre is outstanding as the killer who taunts the police as the noose slowly tightens around him To some extent the film is an early procedural drama as the police use then modern forensic techniques such as finger printing and graphology to try and find the killer Tired of the increased police surveillance the citys criminal element begins their own search mobilising the numerous beggars to be eyes on the street The film touches on a number of issues that are as relevant now as in the s including mob mentality men are accused of being the killer simply for talking to a child rights of the accused the end justifies the means use of torture and the ever thorny issue of mental health and culpability One of the great preWWII German films *I watched a subtitled version on TCM,10

The film also consecrates German Expressionism as a peak of creativity and social relevance a sequence in history where Berlin became literally the best area and arena of expression to an art that had reached its maturityOr M like Mörder murderer in German Maudit in French doomed and Masterpiece in the universal language of cinemaM like Menace and MusicChildren are singing an elimination game of ominous undertones later we see little Elsie playing with the balloon a shadowy silhouette appears the face remains unrevealed while we hear the whistling of In the Hall of Mountain King Before the shark theme in Jaws to the Psycho shrieking violins the Peer Gynt tune became the first notable leitmotif meant to suggest an evil presence the perfect device to put us in the victims standpoint for the first act as powerlessly as the poor mother calling Elsie while her balloon the bait used by Hans Beckert is drifting along the telephone wiresThe effects are then shown through the growing fame of the new Jack the Ripper figure the ensuing paranoia with any adult basically talking to a child is assaulted The killer is a menace to an already crisisstricken society forcing the police department to triple the efforts psychiatric cases are explored handwriting analyzed and daily and nightly raids operated to make further pressure on the criminal worldM for Methodic For its second act M is the seminal police proceduralWhile covering that angle with a documentarylike precision Lang still seems dubious about the polices efficiency and provides an interesting twist by paralleling the work of the law with the outlaws In a long sequence where both sides brainstorm about the methods to use to find him we swing back and forth from one world to another and the only indicator of the side of the law were put in is the presence of uniform last time I saw criminals acting like politicians in a masterpiece it was in The Godfather One even points out insightfully that the killer must be a bourgeois because its the very standard of life that provides the level of idleness driving any easily corruptible mind to the most extreme cornersM like the sign on the shoulderSo in a famous sequence criminals helped by the street beggars find Hans Beckert quicker than the police force he was betrayed by his trademark whistling and irony a little girl who noticed the infamous letter marked on his shoulder The following chase takes maybe too much time for the films own good Not saying the film could do without the struggle to catch him but the court is such a high point of cinemas history that the previous part seems more forgettableAnd Peter Lorre with his round face innocent eyes when hes cornered like a rat and utters his memorable speech gives the performance of a lifetime as a living symptom a man incarnating the sickness of a society where bad people toy with justice and the worst of all acts as childishly as his victims claiming innocence with such rabid eloquence hes almost convincingBeckert says he cant control his impulses a little voice urges him to commit the irreparable acts and his body language is simply gutwrenching when he simply cant put words His lawyer makes a good point about the past of some accusers whose Becket call hypocrites because they could choose to be honest but the accusers retort that whether hes responsible or not hes still a menace Sure whether their reasons are selfish or ethical is debatable but can we empathize with Beckert?M like ModernityLooking at Twitter or Youtube or Facebook comments today you can tell theres something ferocious and still ongoing about mob mentality and a film like M could be deemed as feeble and liberal in the way it provides a tribune to a child molester the worst possible crimeM like MultilayeredYet there are some powerful truths hiding underneath the thriller the truth about a society sick of its own contradictions determined to impose standards of morality white and condemning true crimes black but indulgent toward activities that have no worse repercussion That the film ends with blackclad mothers admitting their own responsibility is perhaps the most optimistic thing about M the sentence doesnt matter what matters is the lesson behind but did German learn the lesson?Ironically one could have seen the rise of the Nazi empire as the antidote like Thea Von Sarbou who wrote the film and worked for the Nazi regime other could also see it as its worst possible consecration like director Fritz Lang That he didnt side with the criminals at the end emphasizes an intuitive comprehension of his world and allowed this film to be hailed as a true intelligent nightmarish and alas premonitory masterpiece with M as the mark of a disillusioned geniusM like Meditative? Mysterious? Mantic?Interestingly the French title is M le Maudit meaning the doomed one as if Beckert was the living incarnation of a doomed society as if there was indeed something rotten in the Weimar Republic and It wouldnt get any better after but could Fritz Lang anticipate it? Looking up his second masterpiece M I was wondering whether Lang reflected his own rejection of German society or cared enough to warn the audience against the impending doom of decadenceSurely the director behind Metropolis could only pinpoint with the accuracy of a soothsayer the limits of a civilization that might take its heritage for granted,9
1263,tt0022100,This movie has it all! This is one of my alltime favorite movies Many people have criticized it because its from  and I say Who cares when you have such a great movie? Peter Lorre gives a  star performance as the child murderer and may I say he is very very haunting Fritz Langs direction is superb; the cinematography is superb! The kangaroo court scene at the end is my favorite part and its brilliantly done The plot is very well crafted Even more amazing is the plot focuses around catching the murderer but it is not boring for one second Each scene flows beautifully into the next with some amazing chases raids and facial expressions This is also a movie ahead of its time This is definitely one of the alltime best movies!,10
1264,tt0022100,Fritz Langs second absolute landmark after the equally brilliant but completely different Metropolis and also his first opportunity to work with the wonders of sound And boy did he ever deliver a great piece of work! Like the M for murderer is marked on Peter Lorres coat the film M for masterpiece is branded on cinema history annals for all eternity Langs film is a triumph in every possible viewpoint and it covers a lot more genres and elements than just simply the manhunt for a childmolester*** SPOILERS ****The horrors M handles about is timeless and of all cultures but yet itll always remain a taboo subject and for that reason alone Fritz Lang deserves extra praising In an utterly astonishing way Peter Lorre portrays Hans Beckert a child murderer who singlehandedly terrorizes four and half million people simply by his uncontrollable urge to kidnap and molest young schoolgirls The grim and haunting atmosphere is terrifically built up by images of previous Beckertvictims and the disappearance a new unfortunate girl Her toy rolling of a remote hillsa balloon drifting away on the wind Really simple but extremely efficient methods to reflect the ominous actions that just took place Other than to focus on the further actions of the killer Lang turns to the effect this terror has on the city and how the manhunt for Beckert develops Our director is obviously fascinated by how a police procedure is organized and he serves the viewer a detailed overview of all the steps taken by the investigators Meanwhile he grabs the opportunity to forcefully criticize the medias influence and the German law system with both hands Id really like to stress that Langs subtle mockery was a really risky thing to do with the upcoming Nazireign so you cant admire him enough Due to the constant and fruitless raids the police are holding in the hope to capture the killer the criminal underworld begins to lose its profits as well and they start their own manhunt for the killer assisted by whores beggars and petty thieves With the carefully observing eyes all over town it becomes practically impossible for Becker to satisfy his monstrous needs The almighty Peter Lorre arrives late in the film every moment hes on screen is a moment worth treasuring His sad appearance and cruel testimony are sequences that leave no human being unmoved Lorre is a brilliant actor and this is inarguably one of the most impressive performances of all time M features constant tension outstanding dialogue and stunning camerawork As said before Fritz Lang had the opportunity to work with sound for this film and he immediately makes the most out of this This was the first big German production that featured sound and it STILL ranks as the title that made best use of itand that sure means something after more than  years Theres the chilling and legendary tune Lorre constantly whistles but also the absence of sound Lang uses to portray the besieged city As you can tell from the above review M is absolute mustsee and easily one of the most essential productions ever shot Its lightyears ahead of its time and still disturbing after all these years This film is a mesmerizing portrait about the darkest most alarming aspects of humanity and yet still it doesnt live up to reallife facts As you probably know the plot of M is based on the whereabouts of the serial killer Peter Kürten who brutally murdered many victims in the city of Düsseldorf I read a biography on Kürten recently and the true details of his crimes and animallusts go beyond every filmmakers wildest imagination,10
1265,tt0022100,Since I loved Metropolis and was mesmerized by the great storyline of M I happily shelled out  euros to get the deluxe DVDset of Fritz Langs first talkie fully expecting I was going to view it over and over againWell that was  euros I should have spent on a new haircut or something This is a very boring film one that is only somewhat redeemed by a great Peter Lorre and an interesting final scene But the first hour was sooo slooow! Low point was a tenminute scene in which four boring men were having a roundtable about deciding what to do about the child killer No camera movement whatsoever just blabbering and no oneliners either Hes a killer for heavens sake  ACTION! DO SOMETHING! STOP HIM! Looking back maybe I was even more mesmerized by the brand M The film posters are great and that single M just makes for a classic even harrowing logoStill I honestly cant believe that a modern viewer would actually enjoy this,4
1266,tt0022100,From the elongated opening scene of M you know you are in for more than a simple film could ever imagine The elongated lunch scene as a mother waits for her daughter to return as we audience members watch the daughter stray from her journey home with a stranger with a sharpened whistle It is foreboding it is depressing it is mesmerizing It has been a very long time since a film especially one made  years ago seemed so delicate so thought provoking so timeless as M does From these opening shots Lang lets us know that this isnt going to be your happy utopia where criminals are caught the next day by the police and our world goes back to liquorish and lollipops but instead a world where the locals collect like a mob and trust is thrown violently out of the window With excellent cinematography and a strong balance between humor and honesty Lang creates this visceral world where the line between truth and justice get blurred where good and evil are similar and a man defines his actions as uncontrollable This merely scratches the surface of M a masterful film that ranks amongst the best this world has offeredWhat makes M shoot ahead of anything modern anything by cult directors anything close to popular? It begins with the actors goes to the man behind the camera and finally the skillful craftsmanship of the story Each of these elements never lack never fall behind and constantly build upon each other until that final breath that encourages you to repetitively rewatch To begin Peter Lorre How could you not talk about M without mentioning this doeeyed murderer From the beginning we know his role in this film yet Lang pulls every emotion out of us as we follow his route We feel sympathy for Lorre when he is tried we feel scared when he is trapped in the attic we feel hatred when he voyeuristically looks at the children  and yet he isnt the only character in this film Lang introduces us to other well placed personas throughout The infamous Inspector Lohmann not to mention that great floorup shot is the perfect example of Langs impressions on the local German police The fact that Lohmann whistles counter productive to what Lorre represents only solidifies that idea To add to these already dynamic people we have the background criminals that decide to take the matter into their own hands in hopes to eliminate the looming police presence The Safecracker is idealistic of what Germany was to become the classic SS look with the idea of eliminating the opportunity to be tried in a true court of law Each one of these characters provide humor excitement and fullblown emotion to the screen adding to the overall impact to this film With Lorre already bedazzling us with his range and taut emotion it is up to Fritz Lang himself to ensure that edits angles and direction doesnt hinder the power of his actors Lang steps up to the plate and delivers with his avantgarde film making I use the words avantgarde because the techniques used in this film are far beyond  Lang incorporates powerful closeups amazing track following and shots nearly unseen at this time The overhead shots the ability to make the crowds look ravenous the camera puns adds just as much as another lead would If you were impressed by his ability in Metropolis M is only going to solidify that idea of Lang A favorite is the raid on the office complex by a group of criminals Every shot every detail is directed with ease but complexity It is easy to be in awe of this film but to take the time to see Langs ability behind the camera will take M to a whole new level Personally it is my belief that he announces himself with this film A pioneer of the camera a grandfather of what cinema is today  one cannot watch anything released today and not see Langs influences See Finchers Zodiac a nearly identical film in themes to what Lang was trying to produce hereFinally we have acting and direction but one must also credit the story for being not just creative and unflinchingly original but for supporting a strong message The idea of being more careful was impressive to watch due to the time being  a time well thought of that children could be anywhere without any worry The story brings evil into an American thought that good guys always prevail that suburbia is always safe and that the police actually do keep the streets safe The story of M challenges you as a viewer even today one could argue even more so today than in  With crimes continually on the rise in this country with the idea that pleading insanity cures the disease of murder or is an easy innocence the idea of M especially that final dialogue seems more important today The fascination also arises with the concept of the mob within this story  the horror that simple events kindness even could turn on anyone in a moment of panic Police arresting anyone that even looks at children in a peculiar way  a fascinating concept that Lang is not afraid to develop Imagine if this film were made two years later what a different theme Lang would have tackledA deeply enticing film Fritz Lang proves that he was a ground breaker in his field Not only could he handle Science Fiction but nearly every other genre imaginable M is no exception to his skill If you have not seen this film watch it  experience it  know what it means to be marked like Lorre Grade ***** out of *****,10
1267,tt0022100,Im a fan of Peter Lorres and I love black &amp; white films  I enjoy foreign films  I even like trying to twist my brain around mindboggling symbolfilled convoluted art flicks  But I was incredibly disappointed in *M*It had a lot of potential but it kept drowning in itself  It took me a while to understand this  The plot itself wasnt overly complex  so why did I still have the feeling of unpleasant confusion  What I finally realized is that *M*s downfall is that it cant decide what it isI went into it with a general understanding of what it was going to be about and knowing Peter Lorres work I had certain expectations  The parts of the movie that were most satisfying to me were those which fit those expectations a tense shadowy atmosphere made all the more eerie and suspenseful by the skillful use of In the Hall of Mountain KingOther parts of the movie felt more like a police procedural  There is certainly a place for the Ed McBains of our world but that place is not being mixed in with Robyn Cook  These segments felt out of place and they jarringly interrupted the mood created by the spookier more emotionally taut scenesThe muchapplauded ending had the same problem for me it suddenly introduced yet another mood  that of introspection and social consciousness  This was too distinct from either of the other two moods to feel as if it were even part of the same pictureEach mood each theme each general strain could have been very good on its own  but as a package the film felt illblended  And as much as I enjoy paradox and even confusion they are not in of themselves sufficient criteria for a good film,3
1268,tt0025316,Frank Capras idealistic outlook on life is evident in his films From It Happened One Night to Its a Wonderful Life Capra has always had a tendency to let the little guy rise above it all and beat the odds It is no small wonder that Capra enjoyed much of his success during the Depression when movies were used to truly pull an audience out of the despair of the s into a world where anything can happen where being a nice person is all you need to succeed While the fact that the country was in the middle of the Depression was not completely ignored an overly optimistic view on life was taken to counter the despair of everyday lifeThere were many points in It Happened One Night where the true state of the country was indicated Homeless people hitching rides on trains seemed perfectly normal Rather than regard them with apprehension and pity you smile and wave at them Another example is the hostile reaction proprietor Zekes wife had to the fact that her husband had let Peter and Ellie stay the night with promises of being paid Upon seeing Peter and Ellies car missing they rush to the cottage to see if Peter and Ellie are still there They cannot afford freeloadersIn another scene a childs mother has passed out from hunger because they have no money to buy food Peter and Ellie have nearly depleted their funds but decide that the mother and child need money more than they do and give some to themDespite these instances the movie was altogether cheerful in its depiction of the world In the throes of the stock market crash this movie signaled the birth of the screwball comedy At a time when the country needed release they could find that release and laughter in movies like It Happened One Night Audiences were amused by scenes in the film such as the segment in which Peter teaches Ellie how to dunk a donut Or when forced to share a room Peter puts a blanket between his and Ellies beds and calls it the `wall of Jericho which is revisited when the walls of Jericho come tumbling down after Peter and Ellies marriage Probably the most famous scene in the film is the hitchhiking sequence which features Peter standing by the roadside trying to thumb a ride unsuccessfully finally giving up after more than a dozen cars speed by without paying any heed to his attempts After he gives up beaten Ellie simply lifts her skirt above her knee The first car that passes stops as we see extreme closeups of a foot slamming down on the brakes and a hand applying the hand brakeA master in his profession Capra left his mark on the films he directed With an almost childlike cheerfulness he maintains a sense of dignity and class The viewer is left with a feeling of hope for humankind even if its only that a persons ideals could be used to make such a film Capras films are still regarded as masterpieces It Happened One Night arguably remains to this day unparalleled in screwball comedies It was one of many movies made during the Depression a sometimes sad and even lonely time in our history It gave its audience a chance to escape and forget their troubles for a few moments in time out of  stars,9
1269,tt0025316,In his autobiography The Names Above the Title Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters the hero the heroine the comedian and the villainWhat Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films the characters of hero and comedian are combined Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself especially with that system all her own But in doing what he did for Clark Gables character Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the moldCapras autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio along the lines of Republic or Monogram As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it Capra also had a stroke of good luck Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day drunk as a skunk is priceless Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldnt have been more cooperativeAt some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day So the publicity drums were beatThe rest as they say is history It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam Best Picture Best Director Best Actor and Best Actress It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios And it set the standard for screwball comedyThe film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert Theyre together for most of the film so if it doesnt click between the two of them you have people walking out in droves Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in Gable and Colbert did only one other film together Boom Town for MGM You cant get much more different than those two films Boom Town had a huge MGM budget Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein Its also a great film but its not a classic like It Happened One Night,10
1270,tt0025316,It Happened One Night directed by Frank Capra was made and released in  by Columbia Pictures as a small budget film that was not expected to do well at the box office Yet after its release the film gained many accolades and won the Academy Award for best picture in  Due to the original small nature of the film the leading man role was surprisingly filled by Clark Gable who was on loan from another studio He stared opposite of Claudette Colbert Capras film was a combination of many ideals emotions and social perceptions of the American society of the thirties but it was also a combination of many new and innovative filming techniques and sound advancements The film unfolds the story in such a attentiongrabbing and remarkable way that most of todays cinema use his style and ideals when producing and creating films Capra used the idea of a moving camera one that was not fixed upon a box but on a moveable crane instead This produced more sweeping shots more angles for filming and fewer distance shots It allowed for more movement of the actors as well as a more realistic and real life feeling to the movie The film also incorporates back projection of images This is were a scene is filmed previously and played in the background while the actors perform the scene in front of the projection Back projection is used for car scenes to give the impression that the actors are driving but in reality they are in a sound stage Capra also incorporated the use of a wipe in his film The technique of moving left to right and fading in or out to change a scene or show elapsed time took the place of the traditional place cards in silent films and allowed for a more constant stream for the film The film was also all talk the new technology of a sound strip on the side of the film was used The text cards of silent films were completely discarded Another camera trick by Capra is to show a change in feelings within Clark Gables character for Claudette Colberts character by depicting her character in a different light This happens two times within the film at key moments to the development of their relationship Claudette Colbert is seen in a close up of softer light to emphasize Clark Gables character seeing her in a `different light In this romantic comedy Capra not only showed new styles and techniques but also addressed social issues of the time Through comedy he showed the outlandish nature of the rich King arriving for his own wedding in a helicopter and the nature of man being the controller in relationships as well as in society The fighting and struggles between the two main characters showed the man taking care of the woman the social norms of how men and woman should act around each other in that era But the fighting and the banter also show a strongminded and intelligent woman The two strongwilled main characters balanced each other outCapras techniques for showing the social relationship between the rich and working classes as well as a relationship between man and woman in the s captured film makers and film viewers for over  years Films are now compared to his style of camera movement and his style of capturing the American ideals When movies of today make a similar statement of achieving what one wants they are referred to as Capraesc Capras imagination and style is one that changed the outlook of American films and introduced a new genre to film goers everywhere,0
1271,tt0025316,IHON rightly earns its place as one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history A pioneer of the screwball comedy genre it holds up very well  years after it was madeIts a classic tale of the battle of sexes something that is still so relevant today We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Claudette Colbert who jumps ship from her fathers yacht literally! in Florida after an argument with said father played by Walter Connolly over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley Jameson Thomas without her fathers consent Ellie is on a mission to get to New York to King Westley But how will she do it? Thats how Peter Warne played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable comes into the story Recently fired from his newspaper job Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York and realizing who she is Her story is all over the news after all! offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story to win him back his job And so the fun begins Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances The trip isnt a smooth one and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie which gives us great scenes such as the doughnutdunking lesson Walls Of Jericho and the nowclassic hitchhiking scene The humour is still fresh and fastpaced over  years later Oops I almost forgot the classic no undershirt scene where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses to reveal shock horror! no undershirt but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of mens undershirts which dropped dramatically after the films release One of the first examples of product placement in film Great supporting characters particularly the scenestealing Oscar Shapeley Roscoe Karns Of course it has its faults all early talkies do But any faults are outweighed by the great story Technically it was wellmade for its timeIHON won  Oscars Best Picture Best Director Frank Capra Best Actress and Best Actor for Colbert and Gable and Best Adaptation It deserved all of them Funnily enough both Colbert and Gable didn&amp;#;t want any part in the film at first I bet they changed their viewpoint after the surprise success and the prestigious Academy Awards they gained for it Its been said that a number of Disney characters like Bugs Bunny Yosemite Sam and Pepe LePew were inspired by characters in this film A classic a mustsee a great movie,10
1272,tt0025316,This is a pleasant funny classic that shows it age only slightly and that has a lot of scenes you can look forward to each time that you see it Gable and Colbert each get roles that are nicely suited to them and are wellremembered for their performances  The supporting cast also rounds out the picture with some good character actingThe crosscountry trip on the bus and via other assorted methods is fun to watch with several nice vignettes that complement the main story line The atmosphere on the long bus trip is done especially well  The plot is of course not meant to be taken too seriously in itself but it comes in very handy for setting up good characters and comedyIt all comes across as effortlessly entertaining romantic comedy with some classic scenes and characters you learn to care for in spite of their mistakes,0
1273,tt0025316,This sweet comedy never loses its appeal  Claudette Colbert is a spoiled young girl who meets a wordly attractive newspaper reporter Clark Gable In the beginning she treats him like a servant but he never knuckles under to this behavior  The interaction between these two is very romantic and humorous  It is the classic portrayal of what may be called sexual tension  He takes care of her  does not take advantage of her  but makes her realize that her wealthy background cannot carry her through as a human being she has to earn his respect by treating him with respect  There is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike and their breakfast is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find  As Gable stands at the edge of the road and Colbert is perched atop a wooden fence his wisecracking posture is said to be the inspiration for the beloved cartoon character Bugs Bunny  This is a mustsee for every one who loves old movies and entertaining for all,10
1274,tt0025316,It Happened One Night is one of those films that is so classic and on so many `mustsee lists that I actually assumed that I had seen it at one time or another  It wasnt until I actually looked into the film when I in fact realized I hadntThe first film to sweep the major categories in an Oscar ceremony It Happened One Night spins the story of a young spoiled heiress Colbert who marries a shallow yet dashing aviator  She is then swept off by her father who takes her on a cruise; convinced that time away from each other will cure her infatuation  Instead she escapes by jumping out of the boat and swimming to shore where she begins her journey from Miami to New York where her husband awaits  The film quickly turns into an `on the road flick at this point when she meets up with Clark Gable a down on his luck reporter who offers to help her for the exclusive rights to her story  Mayhem inevitably ensues as one thing after another goes wrong during their adventureIm a little hesitant to completely agree with the general assessment that It Happened One Night is a screwball comedy  Of course there were certain moments that were hilarious and overdone the scene when Gable and Colbert pose as husband and wife to share a cabin for the night is absolutely rich but the majority of the remaining film is clever romantic comedy with fairly even performances by the principles  Perhaps there is a sliding scale for screwball comedies with It Happened One Night being a two and a film that I feel personifies the genre Bringing up Baby as a five,8
1275,tt0025316,Consider this It Happened One Night was made in  which gives it the distinction + years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences And most of the runnerups for oldest film are s screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the  Academy Awards The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant The main reason It Happened One Night worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capras direction Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut Cohn told Capra That French broad likes money and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $ double her usual price and a guarantee that production would only last  days Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this filmThe film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra a great script that would play well with small town America and a good ensemble of supporting talent The story concerns a spoiled young heiress Colbert trying to escape the control of her father nicely played by Walter Connelly Dodging her fathers private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter Gable who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other brainless brat and obnoxious bully as an undisclosed affection develops On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each otherWhile the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film As another reviewer has written Far from loveydovey the dialogue is witty sharp and occasionally heartless We may know the outcome but the road to get there is paved with arguments anger and misunderstandings Its also clever funny and a bit risqué for   During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult motivated by a desire to improve her companions opinion of her Gable shows real star presence playing a confident charming and resourceful gentleman By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partnerAfter the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director OscarThen again what do I know? Im only a child,9
1276,tt0025316,I have seen this movie a few times over the year and have just recently  viewed it again twice on the DVD version This is a highly recommended  movie on several levels First it has to be seen because it won  multiple academy awards during  It has won at least best actor best actress and best director  So it should be seen just for its historical significance if you are  into movies as an art form However if you are just looking for  entertainment then it is simply a great classic romantic comedy The  set up is that Ellie Claudette Colbert is a rich spoiled  independent woman who is running away from her father in Florida to  join her husband not quite a complete marriage in New York City She  meets Peter Clark Gable on the bus who is a down &amp; out reporter  looking for a big story They join forces in that he will help her to  get to New York for an exclusive on her story In essence it is the  bratty socialite vs the hard nosed know it all reporter  Can they  achieve true love? Just watch the movie and figure it out for  yourself There is the classical scene regarding the battle of the  sexes which involves hitchhiking There is some dated material because  the movie was made in the s about the s This may be both good  and bad as a viewing experience Gable is a bit too shallow as a  desirable character He lacks the sensitivity of a guy that would be in  a modern romantic comedy However his portrayal of Peter is likely  typical for the ideal man of the era in that he attempted to be  competent and in charge at all times the know it all guy The  character comes across as too simplistic by todays standards However  when he gets the feedback on his rough edges from Ellie he shows his  nice guy side Claudette Colbert is great in this movie she had  opportunities to display her acting craft as she responded to different  situations The scene in which she and Gable pretended to be basically  white trash was very funny Her getting the best actress award is  very evident even without having to see the performances of her  rivalries for the Oscar in  Overall this movie is rated a  and  is highly recommended A viewer may avoid older movies because they  lack dept; however hang in for this one Once the screen chemistry  starts between Colbert and Gable their first scene together the rest  of the picture is just a joyride of entertainment in watching these two  work their magic for the camera Enjoy this movie it should be an  awesome experience,0
1277,tt0025316,In my college film class we had begun watching It happened one night I was laughing my head off But of course my professor stops the movie right when it was getting good After that I wanted to see this movie so badly My father lucky enough had the movie I watched it and it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen Clark Gable is histerical He really does a great job in the film I always did prefer the old comedies to today Do you blame me? If you watch the flick you will enjoy it This is one of the first romantic comedies Itll send all the others to the back of the bus I would higly recommend this movie Its a classic/,10
1278,tt0025316,Released in  Frank Capras It Happened One Night ushered in a new era of Hollywood filmmaking  the screwball comedy  and made Academy Award history in the process It became the first film to be awarded the top five awards on the night Best Picture Director Actor Actress and Screenplay a feat that remained unequaled until One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  and The Silence of the Lambs  As I watch more of his films Frank Capra is fast becoming one of my most respected directors with such classics as Mr Smith Goes to Washington and Its a Wonderful Life ranking among my favourites of all time This screwball comedy however posed a certain problem since Ive never been a huge fan of the subgenre Whilst I had enjoyed such films as My Man Godfrey and His Girl Friday they hadnt really offered anything other than comedy This means that they did a good job of making us laugh but never really inspired any other emotions  which isnt necessarily a handicap but doesnt appeal to my tastesHappily Im able to announce that It Happened One Night did surpass my expectations and I found it to be a wonderfullyenjoyable very touching romantic comedy The first half had left me feeling a bit uncertain since it reminded me of just about every other s comedy Id seen but then Frank Capra did what Frank Capra does best he put a lot of heart into the film After building towards a perfect fairytale ending Capra suddenly snatches it away slowly but surely stacking the odds against our hero However the director has never been one to leave us with a downbeat ending and when love finally prevails it feels twice as triumphant Of course crucial to the films success are the two lead performers Claudette Colbert and Clarke Gable playing characters of completely polar characters As story runs its course we slowly watch their relationship transform from completely dislike to acceptance to romance and it never feels forced or artificial despite a reportedly tense atmosphere onsetThe plot of the film was based on the story The Night Bus by Samuel Hopkins Adams Ellie Andrews Colbert is the arrogant spoilt heiress of a wealthy father Walter Connolly After she marries the rich but unprincipled King Westley Jameson Thomas against her fathers will Ellie strikes off to New York to be with the man she loves and her desperate father launches a statewide attempt to retrieve her It is on a night bus that Ellie strikes up a frictional relationship with fired journalist Peter Warne Gable whose only initial interest in the stranded girl is a good newspaper story Probably one of the best road movies ever made It Happened One Night also has a few twists in the usual formula which have guaranteed its enduring stature For example Ellies father is revealed not to be an evil overbearing demon but is in fact shown to be a very kind reasonable and loving man who is only trying to guarantee the best for his daughter by ensuring that she marries somebody with principles King Westley later gives up the girl without a fuss compensated by a tidy sum of moneyMuch to my surprise Id never seen a film starring Clarke Gable before but he really was a revelation Never taking any situation too seriously and delivering every line with confidence and a hint of amusement Gable is the laidback everyman that the audience can relate to a stark contrast to Colberts conceited and ungrateful upperclass rich girl My favourite scene took place after the night bus accidentally ran off the road with the shifty passenger Oscar Shapeley Roscoe Karns threatening to reveal Ellies true identity Fearing that his exclusive story could leak into other hands Peter Warne declares himself to be the gangster who kidnapped Ellie threatens to harm Shapeleys family and then chases him into the night Interestingly I followed up my viewing of this film with a  Lux Radio Theater broadcast of the story introduced by Cecille B DeMille and once again starring Gable and Colbert This recording can be found if youre lucky as a special feature on the It Happened One Night DVD and its well worth a listen,8
1279,tt0025316,I was inspired to think of other films with completely mystifying titles `The Phantom Menace obviously  Also `The Shop Around the Corner around the corner from WHERE? `The Empire Strikes Back it doesnt `The Living Daylights `True Lies `Batman Forever `Species `The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp  if anyone has any more suggestions please send them to meIn this case it happens over several nights and Im not sure which particular night is being referred to  Probably one of the candidate nights is less unobvious than the rest; so I guess the title isnt COMPLETELY mystifying  But actually Capra gives us the feeling that everything is up in the air  Everyone knows that the hero and heroine of romantic comedies are bound to get hitched in the end  in most cases its simply a question of staying awake  But Capra makes us feel the contingency of it all  I for one was convinced that right up until the final moment it could have gone either way  How did Capra manage this?  Was it because he was a complete innocent; or was it because he was remarkably sophisticated?  I dont suppose it matters its results that countIm glad to see very little mention among the comments about the sexism of it all  The characters have life; their words have life; and if such art as this could only be produced by a sexist society its almost worth creating a sexist society and then dismantling it in order to get the art  In modern romances I get the feeling that the writers are wearily writing `feisty lines for the heroine in an attempt to fool feminists who by and large arent so easily fooled  Claudette Colbert isnt feisty  When she DOES assert her independence she means itAnd of course when Clark Gable asserts his dominance HE means it  You dont get sincerity like this these daysAnyway the ideology of a film if there is one is always beside the point except inasmuch as the ideology is AESTHETICALLY attractive or unattractive This is an attractive film  Two real individuals a real story some misunderstanding but no tiresome or pointless misunderstanding constant wit  and as I expressed amazement at earlier constant suspense  And if THAT isnt enough to get you to watch it note that it was released in   The Hayes code didnt come into effect until   Not a moment too late,10

1281,tt0025316,Capras It Happened One Night is a fascinatingly shot romantic comedy It has the s feel but at the same time I am surprised that such skill was used in the making of this movie during the s The camerawork is brilliant as it brings out both the spatial feel and the crowdiness the long shots are effective and I liked how the scenes change in a sideways flip mode Theres always something about the driving scenes of old classics that amuse me Clearly the background was shot separately and then projected on to a screen during the shooting of the film while in the foreground the actors are just seated in a car pretending to drive While the background scene changes the viewer keeps tuned to the wonderful dialogue between the actors Needless to add the films got fantastic dialogueCapra also brilliantly gives us a glimpse of the s American society especially focusing on gender and class status The difference between the upper class rich people and the common ordinary man is shown by their use of language and their nonverbal behaviour Yet in a way the film is also ahead of its time Ellie isnt just some clichéd damsel of the s She is strongminded stubborn and smart albeit slightly naive She is one who fights for what she wants rather than giving in easily Perhaps this is also one quality of hers that attracts Peter but at the same time their funny quarrels also indicate that there is a an equality in gender status which was something women were struggling with in those daysThe characters are very well etched Peter and Ellie were a lot of fun but I also liked how Alexander Andrews played excellently by Walter Connolly was written as the rich father whos got all the money but all he wants for his daughter is her happiness Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are great together as they match wits and display warm chemistryIt Happened One Night has become an instant favourite one that I definitely plan to revisit,0

1284,tt0025316,A spoiled heiress Claudette Colbert running away from her family is helped by a man Clark Gable who is actually a reporter looking for a storyIn this film a pampered socialite tries to get out from under her fathers thumb and falls in love with a roguish reporter which you know is something that happens when spoiled daughters discover that they want to live like common people and do what common people do like go to supermarketsThe film was the first to win all five major Academy Awards Best Picture Director Actor Actress and Screenplay a feat that would not be matched until One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  and later by The Silence of the Lambs  And it is not really surprising when you see it besides it is Clark Gable and Frank CapraSo this might not be as outright funny as other films and even as far as screwball comedies go it sort of lags behind The Awful Truth with Cary Grant But Clark Gable has a debonair charm to him from the very beginning he has that attitude about him that women mysteriously love I am a little confused about the laidback approach to marriage and annulment but this is a romance and that is not uncommon if anything it shows how fickle the socialite isOverall a very enjoyable film Not my favorite of the era but well worth a watch or two And heck if such a film can inspire the creation of Bugs Bunny and entertain Joseph Stalin can it be so bad?,8
1285,tt0025316,Peter a washed up journalist accidentally bumps into Ellen Andrews a spoiled daughter of a rich guy from whom she ran away on a bus while taking a trip to New York He offers to help her hide from her dad if she agrees to sell her story only to him But on their way to New York they fall in loveThere are many old classic film that are excellent but leave you with a Yeah greatbut I expected something else feeling But It happened one night is one of those films that leaves you amazed without any reservations I was neither a Clark Gable Claudette Colbert or a Frank Capra fan before I saw this road movie which won  Oscars but after I did I became of fan of them for life! The story here is so damn simple that you may at first think that everyone could be able to pull it of but when you think about it you will realize that at the same time its actually very clever carefully written and touching Take this scene for instance Ellen is looking in front of herself while a burglar steals her luggage behind her back She doesnt notice anything but Peter sees this and runs after the burglar Ellen still not turning around is wondering where he is running of to After a while Peter all tired returns and says He got away! And Ellen not knowing whats going on replies I dont know what you are talking about! Thats a perfect example how someone is trying to be a gentleman and ends up as a fool But this is actually a film more touching than funny After a while the spoiled Ellen shows her gentle side and realizes that she loves Peter She says this to her father in tears because she thinks that Peter doesnt love her So incredibly magical and yet so simple Its incredibly high grade of / on the site rottentomatoescom is justified Too bad almost all TV stations are keeping this jewel of air for decades! No wonder my generation is trapped in a vicious circle of violence drugs and alcohol They never got a glimpse of such previous generations with a soul and such raw honest and touching beauty like It happened one night which exceeds the human mindGrade /,10
1286,tt0025316,Its a true call that they dont make the movies as they used to There are very less movies coming near to the brilliance of It Happened One Night This movie is about a rich brat running from her home to get married with her lover accompanied with struggling free lancer reporter in her journey And in the journey they fall for each other The romance building between two of them is nicely depicted and the blend of Peter Warne Gables arrogant personality gives it a nice stir The story of the movie is very interesting and the comic attribute added by both Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is sufficed to make anyone laugh The perfect direction from the master of his domain Frank Capra takes the movie on highest level; because of this its the first movie to be honored with all major five Oscars Best Actor Best Actress Best Movie Best Director and Best Screenplay,10
1287,tt0025316,It Happened One Night happens to be my personal most favorite film ever It was an adapted screenplay by Robert Riskin from the short story Night Bus and was directed by Frank Capra With a simple story plot modest budget and a very short four week production schedule this film goes a long way Director Frank Capra obviously knew the story to tell and how to tell it Some of the best films are made in a surprisingly short amount of time and on a modest budget This film followed what Capra hoped would be a critical and box office success The hopes were low for this film even after securing stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert for the lead roles Columbia Studios was not well respected at the time in HollywoodIt Happened One Night  had a relatively small budget for its time $ of which Claudette Colbert asked for and received $ for her role A star receiving this much of the total film budget was unheard of during the s Released during Americas Great Economic Depression the film had excellent timing and proved to be a big critical and audience hit All the right elements came together It had a high quality comedic screenplay with believable characters in believable situations A film where luck and chemistry came together producing a film that exceeded the expectations of everyone involved including its director Frank CapraThe film comes across as light hearted and natural and with excellent timing and pacing For its time this style of film was new It would be one of the first of a new genre screwball romantic comedy Winner of five Academy Awards in all the major categories Best Picture Director Adapted Screenplay Actor in a Leading Role and Actress in a Leading Role was a first in Hollywood history Only two other films have swept the five top Academy Awards One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest  and The Silence of the Lambs Claudette Colbert was quoted as saying I just finished the worst film ever on It Happened One Night She had no idea how well the film would be edited The film editing here is subtle and sublime Colbert and Gable achieved that rare and special screen chemistry in the film Colberts demand that the film needed to be produced in four weeks because of her vacation schedule actually created the lively pace of the film working in its favor It Happened One Night is a fine example of a quality screenplay some good luck and a lot of chemistry all coming together producing an enduring and enjoyable comedy classicClark Gable comes across as completely natural and very entertaining The fun had while making this film shows partly in Gables performance Unfortunately he would not be cast in a comedic role again even after the big success of this film The studio system of the time demanded stars remain typecasted For Gable that meant macho romantic leading action manTo me It Happened One Night is the best ever romantic comedy film a gold standard for its genre Its lost none of its charm and naturalness since its release in  The look of the film dates it but it still delivers its original naturalness charm wittiness timing pacing and entertainment value Just about a perfectly made film,10
1288,tt0025316,It Happened One Night must have put on a smile on Depressionweary audiences way back in  Over  years later the magic still works due to the terrific combination of Gable Colbert and director CapraBut it almost didnt happen at allBoth Gable and Colbert tried desperately to get out of doing IHON In fact it appeared noone in Hollywood wanted the parts of Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews The tiny cashstrapped Columbia Studios was making this film with an untried comedy formula it looked a certain flop Pfft How wrong everyone was IHON swept the Academy Awards taking home all of the Major Awards including Best Actor and Actress Awards for Gable and Colbert It established the screwball comedy genre and the careers of its two stars and director CapraWhy is it so good? Well it has remained so fresh over the years that the laughs beat out almost every modern romantic comedy It doesnt have to rely on smut or toilet humour to satisfy the audience just a classic battle of the sexes we can all relate to Its witty the dialogue is snappy and fastpaced and the acting is near perfect So lets have a closer look at the plot of this gem Spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Colbert has just defied her father by marrying society aviator King Westley Her angry father wishes to keep Ellie away from her unsuitable husband and whisks her away on his private yacht Daddy hasnt counted on Ellies tenacity and will fed up with the fact her childish hungerstrike is going nowhere she literally jumps overboard When back on dry land she tries to make her way back to her husband by bus trip A series of unfortunate events bring out of work newspaper reporter Peter Warne into her life Cue the battle of the sexes! She has no money so she must accept his help; he knows who she is and to land the biggest scoop of his career he must deceive her whilst also helping her get back to Westley But problems arise when the pair inevitably start to fall in loveThis film is just the tonic that Depression audiences would have soaked up The parodying of the rich is sublime you cant help rooting for Gable who is a fine representative of the underdog It also has its risqué elements that Im surprised got past the Hayes Code that had just been enforced In particular Gables sexy lesson to a shocked yet interested Colbert on how a man undresses and the final breaking down the walls of Jericho scene When Gable undressed to reveal a bare chest with NO undershirt sales dropped off dramatically This would be one of the earliest examples of product placement in filmSome of my favourite scenes the donutdunking lesson the piggyback ride Gable and Colberts mock fight and the justifiably classic Hitchhiking scene Colbert beats the cocky Gable at his own game by proving that SHE doesnt have to use her thumb to pull a ride Instead she shows a bit of leg and stops a vehicle much to the horror of Gable Great stuff!This film almost singlehandedly established the great screwball comedy Colberts Ellie is the ultimate screwy damepaving the way for Lombard and Hepburn in the genre with Gables Peter a direct forerunner to the Fredrich March character in the screwball classic Nothing Sacred  This films holds a very important place in motion picture historyBest of all its so enjoyable/,10
1289,tt0025316,The first movie to sweep all the major Academy Awards this film is still popular today Thats probably so because the dialog between the two stars of the picture  Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert  is just great Those two make this fun to watch I enjoyed it however much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect The ending too was very weak Over the last  minutes the two stars go their separate ways until the very end and the story gets very stupidThe nice romance that had developed between the two seemed to have disintegrated when Gable left one early morning for good intentions but didnt tell Colbert The latter thought Gable ran out on her Hollywood in films of the s and s loved to have romances in which confusion abounded and everything was misinterpreted for the worstuntil the happy ending when the truth somehow would surface That same theme was in here along with yet another trivialization of marriage another common theme during the classic era Colbert says it herself in one line mentioning she doesnt care for this other guy but what the heck might as well get married whats the difference? Huh?If the scriptwriters here would have just kept the road part of this film going longer  with Gable and Colbert trading barbs  it would have been super Gable has the best lines an is the most fun to watch but Colbert can hold her own She looks really pixieish and cute although most of her closeups are done with a fuzzy lens another habit of filmmakers of that era had with female stars One of the film worlds most famous scenes is in this movie the hitchhiking scene in which the cocky Cable explains the different ways of successful thumbing in order to get a rideand gets nowhere while Colbert on her first try gets a car to stop immediately after she lifts up her skirt! That is still one of the great comedic scenes in movie historyOverall this is still one of the best comedies of The Golden Age even with its faults,8
1290,tt0025316,A cute love story that rivals any of the cookiecutter romantic comedies of today Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert play very well off of each other Sure its cheesy in parts but thats what makes these older movies so much fun,8
1291,tt0025316,Its been over eighty years since It Happened One Night debuted on screens and still it remains the quintessential romantic comedy to watch While being the influence of countless films since It Happened One Night is triumphant and timeless because of its great cast director and script At the start of the film we see the beautiful Ellen Andrews Claudette Colbert in Florida aboard her wealthy fathers luxury boat Ellen is planning to marry King Westley but her father disapproves of him and forces her to stay on the boat until he can find someone more suitable to his liking This leads her to run away and seek out Westly herself while her father puts out a highly publicized bounty for her return She boards a bus to New York and crosses paths with the charismatic Peter Warne Clark Gable Hes a gifted newspaper reporter who also has a drinking problem that constantly gets him in trouble Once Warne figures out who Ellen really is he proposes a plan to her He will escort her to New York for the rights to her story which has become a national headline While the seemingly mismatched pair goes on an adventure they eventually warm up and become close The plot flies at a freeflowing pace that allows for wickedly good oneliners The script is fantastic and allows for great comedic timing and also a sense of drama There is a bit of suspense as the willthey wontthey couple explore their feelings for each other While watching the film you get the sense that they will end up together but its never fully guaranteed and leaves room for you to doubt We meet several supporting characters that mostly never overstay their welcomes such as the bumbling Shapeley and boisterous Zeke They are great in the small amount of time they get and dont distract from the main narrative One minor problem with the story is that the geography is very confusing The audience is left out of the loop when it comes to knowing where exactly the leads are This makes it hard to track the importance of each settingThis is the prime example and maybe founding of the screwball comedy Screwball comedies tell the story of two leads often an unmarried man and woman that come from different social classes and how they interact with each other based on their previous lifestyles If you like films such as Heaven Can Wait and Raising Arizona you should thank this film for popularizing the genre Frank Capra won the academy award for Best Director for this film and he totally deserved it He balances his cast well and allows them to have total freedom within the cramped space of the frame He pushes the camera for claustrophobic scenes that force the actors to work together to make the physical comedy work The acting is the definite draw and best part of the film Both Gable and Colbert took home academy awards for their performances Gable will go down as one of the best romantic leads ever Hes handsome quick on his feet and witty He also delivers the perfect oneliners with confidence and swagger to make women want him and men to want to be him Colbert does an excellent job as the uptight and bratty female that so many leading ladies are still trying to replicate almost eighty years later She perfectly embodies a rich girl that is out of her element while in the real world She bounces off Gables laid back working man character with ease and her oneliners are just as good or even better than his Walter Connolly also does a good job as Ellies wealthy father Alexander Andrews He plays the overprotective but also understanding father At first he wants Ellen to marry someone rich and famous in order to boost his social status but after seeing her unhappiness he changes and sees the errors of his ways Hes one of those fathers that every girl wants and every man should strive to be It Happened One Night is the biggest influence on the romantic comedy genre Having the great pair of Gable and Colbert and Capra as the director lifts this film to the heavens of classic cinema Even in  the film is still fun and can be used to teach writers how to create good comedy,7
1292,tt0025316,OMG this film so hilarious clever and sweet It has original story and fresh idea about romantic comedy Clark Gable really did excellent job to bring this film more live He is so funny clever and comical Everything that he is doing in this film look so natural and funny Definitely one of Clarks best performance He really deserve an Oscar for his performance Chemistry between he and Claudette Colbert very delightful and cute Just simply romantic Bravo!!!,10

Sadly with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue the world of silent filmmaking began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable Nevertheless Chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating City Lights  which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made but by the time Modern Times was released Chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying artModern Times is not an entirely silent film there are dialogue snippets and sound effects but if you look closely every character with dialogue excluding Chaplin himself is being mocked Even when The Tramp opens his mouth the only time he ever did so in a film the words are nonsensical defying the burgeoning convention that dialogue is mandatory for substance entertainment and qualityDespite the films status as one of the greatest comedies of alltime it is hard to ignore the political component In his movies Chaplin often exhibited a great mistrust for authority and progress as often embodied through the social elite the police and wealthy entrepreneurs The irony of the films title then is twofold It connects with Chaplins own bitter feelings regarding his moribund art form but also refers to the plight of the working classes during the Great Depression long working hours with little job security and meager salary while the upper classes remain wealthy and bide their idle time The world was changing fast and Chaplin foresaw that many of these changes were far from beneficialAs we watch The Tramp struggle through the modern mechanized world we laugh at his antics and the absurdity of their results but we can also feel pain and pity He is clearly a man who does not belong Indeed The Tramp can almost be thought of as a misfit who has passed through a membrane from some alternate reality and unwittingly fallen into our familiar world notice that he does not have a name or identification of any kind and as far as we know he has no friends family funds or historyHe takes on assembly lines feeding machines department stores policemen and various other massoriented aspects of the industrialized world all which demand and exhibit sameness and conformity but The Tramp and his symbolic extension the individual never seem to fitThis is consequently why Modern Times is also one of the most poignant love stories ever put on film The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young homeless woman who is referred to as The Gamin and is played by Chaplins thenwife Paulette Goddard These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward despite adversity Both are nameless neither has a home and they each have no money or material possessionsIt is here that Chaplin makes his most poignant and saddening statement about modern living The Tramp and The Gamin are the only characters who exhibit individuality and idealism yet they are also the ones lowest on the social and economic food chain The conclusion of the film which most likely reflects upon Chaplins own emotions is tinged with sadness but also a lingering hopefulness that resonates as loudly and clearly today as it did more than sixty years agoThen there is of course the comedy which is the stuff of legendary status Some of the most memorable comic images in film history are found in Modern Times These include The Tramps bout with an assembly line and his resulting twitches his unfortunate encounter with nosepowder the moment when he quite literally becomes a cog in the wheels of industry and his epic struggle to bring roast duck to an angry customerIn my opinion however the two standout moments are the scene in a department store involving a blindfold and some rollerskates the most exquisite moment of comedy in the film and the sequence where The Tramp is submitted to the mad whim of an outofcontrol feeding machine the most uproarious moment in the filmThese are just a handful of moments that make Modern Times the enduring masterpiece that it is On a personal level the aspect of the film that resonates strongest with me is its appeal to the idealistic misfit in all of us In our hearts many of us long for the simplicity and exuberance with which The Tramp and The Gamin live life with attention to the bare essentials and an absence of need for materialism and modern trappingsAs Chaplin so skillfully shows however our modern times make this lifestyle a faded dream lost among the sheeplike herds of men and women scurrying through a modern metropolis that only Fritz Lang could make seem darker and more devoid of true humanity Still the final image of Modern Times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an everchanging world,10
1295,tt0027977,It is difficult to review Chaplins movies objectively because many of us have seen them or at least have heard about them since we were young They have become part of our emotional and/or cultural backgroundChaplin is arguably the only complete director in most of his pictures he also produces acts writes the script composes the music does his own stunts and edits His talent and reputation generated numerous commercial successes even when he continued directing silent movies after their time Talkies were the only films produced after  the few silent attempts afterwards were failures; yet Chaplin was an exception City Lights in  and Modern Times in  were sensations worldwide the latter includes a few sounds but they are marginal This is remarkable since nine years is an eternity in cinema timeframe Only in  did Chaplin direct a talkie*** WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS ***Is the movie a comedy? Partly tragicomedy is Chaplins trademark In my opinion there are three levels of humour Pure amusement sometimes as in slapstick the tramp eats all he can to be sent to jail and even buys more when he is with the policeman; he is drugged in jail; the tramp and the gamin imagine their life in an idyllic house; the tramp rollerskates close to an edge in the department store fabulous stunt; he makes a lousy waiter but a great actor at the end Again I am not certain how much of the fun is derived from childhood memories and/or the fact we feel younger as we watch the film To enjoy it fully we must lay aside some of our adult critical sense notably towards oldfashioned cinema No humour just drama the gamins father dies; her sisters are taken away; the tramp crashes his way through the crowd to get a job an efficient illustration of ruthless competition  Amusement with a dramatic twist these are the most frequent scenes and probably the best We grin even as we laugh The movie opens on sheep moving grouped of which a black one an allusion to the tramp? that fade out to workers coming out of the subway This must have been a shock for the audience during the Great Depression Another example is one of Chaplins most famous scenes ever the tramp tries the eating machine It is at the same time hilarious Chaplin really gives all of himself here and pathetic a metaphor on illconceived progress oppression of man by machine and conditions of workers obliged to comply with strange requestsOther scenes include the entire first part in the factory including when the tramp is stuck in the machine inside shot that became iconic which also happens to a colleague later on outside shot; the tramp launches by mistake an unfinished ship into the sea with footage of an actual ship that was probably sunk because of the Depression; the tramp and the gamin make most of their shabby hutThe movie efficiently alternates these three levels of humour as well as its rhythm It famously starts as a whirlwind with dynamic tempo and music And it ends like a rollercoaster funny musical the tramp sings emotional he is hired dramatic the police arrest the gamin thriller they run away as climatic music plays melancholic they are on the road free but uncertain The last image is rightfully doubleedged the tramp and the gamin walk away but mountains ahead block their road She looks like an elegant lady he looks a bit like a clown with his funny walk and big shoes We dont know where they are going nor do theyHence Chaplins ambition was far more than to just divert Themes depicted eighty years ago are still modern<ul><li>Crisis redundancies strikes inequalities social unrest</li></ul><ul><li>Working conditions in factories even though exaggerated by humour and symbols productivity control burnout</li></ul><ul><li>Technology that dehumanises chainworking the eating machine video surveillance a sciencefiction element at the time Remarkably the only sounds of the film are coming from devices not humans screen phonograph radio</li></ul><ul><li>Success with talent work and some luck</li></ul><ul><li>The law The topic is prominent the police are omnipresent and ambiguous Can one steal food to survive? Chaplin seems to excuse this behaviour The tramp is on both sides of the law he steals food but helps the police arrest villains in jail And the polices role is complex; notably they shoot an unarmed man followed by the ironic card The law takes charge of the orphans</li></ul><ul><li>Violence and drugs in prison</li></ul>The universal dimension of the movie shows by the fact the main characters have no name the tramp the gamin Chaplin will be blamed for its social topics during the McCarthy era among other grievances and he will be forced to exile Considering it now this seems ridiculous since the message of the film is not communist the tramp and the gamin want everything but change society; they search for a job a home and respect Note also Lincolns portrait in the tramps cell he is a patriotThe movie does not take sides Workers can be friendly or violent Policemen can be friendly eg in jail or violent one purposelessly pushes the tramp outside the factory Prison inmates can be honest the tramp or villains Women can be attractive the gamin or not all others actually This doublesidedness also divides individuals Big Bill was bullying the tramp in the factory but later sympathises with him The gamin steals and then becomes settled The tramp will do anything to protect the ones he loves the gamin children but can abuse almost anybody else to achieve it a recurrent feature in Chaplins picturesThe underlying message seems to be people are not good or bad it mainly depends on their conditions Yet another modern theme,10
1296,tt0027977,Modern Times is in my top  films and # in my list of favorite comedies Charles Chaplin is arguably the most talented human being nevermind film maker that ever lived I first saw this treasure about  years ago and I watched it again recently to make sure that it really WAS funny and that I had not given it too much praise because it was simply a Chaplin film Modern Times passed my test with flying colors I laughed hysterically from start to finish Each and every scene is innovative well thought out and executed with the genius that only Chaplin possessed Among my favorite scenes are the automatic workerfeeding machine; the jail scene in the cafeteria when The Tramp accidentally sprinkles cocaine on his food thinking it is salt; and the roller skating scene in the department store No special effects or computer animation just pure simple geniusThe storyline in Modern Times is purposefully naive a trick Chaplin used time and again to bring a profound humanitarian quality to his films Watching this film is comparable to watching a Warner Bros cartoon which coming from me is a sincere compliment The level of physical comedy in Modern Times is on par with the masterful short films of Chuck Jones Friz Freleng and othersFinally as was the case with most of his later films Modern Times is a serious social commentary Its message is as relevant today as it was more than sixty years ago when it was released In fact it is arguably even more relevant today and unless the world changes drastically in the future it will continue to be Modern Times is essentially the story of a simple but extremely kind man caught in the traps of industrialized society The opening scene which compares a crowd of workers boarding the subway to a flock of sheep is Chaplins warning against standardization mechanization and other facets of life which rob men and women of their individuality Chaplin always tried to speak for the downtrodden because despite his enormous success and wealth he never forgot where he came from In the end Modern Times is a reminder that no matter how bad things are you can still smile Charles Chaplin has made more people smile than almost any other and his legacy of love and laughter lives on in his films Its up to us to keep his legacy alive,10
1297,tt0027977,Favorite Chaplin film Packed with social commentary that is still relevant today Chaplin does a superb job of representing the average worker of the time and the mental impact that the daily motions of what we consider normal in society Such as the opening of the movie in which a scene of a morning rush of people going to work fades into a herd of sheep Chaplin hilarious slapstick comedy is also present in this film while still keeping serious undertones The best example of this is the eating machine This particular scene was a perfect representation of the problems in our society a machine meant to further regiment the day of a worker only to break in the process while also causing a laugh out loud reaction My favorite part of this film is definitely the ending in which Chaplin sings a song and dances What makes this scene so great is not only the fact that it was the first time Chaplin/The Tramp ever spoke but that it was also a stance against talkies Although Chaplin sings the lyrics are complete gibberish but the audience understands regardless All in all I believe Modern Times is Chaplins greatest film this was the first Chaplin film I had ever seen and since then have watched all of them and found a great respect for Chaplin and silent movies overall,10
1298,tt0027977,It is a testament to Chaplins filmmaking skills that he is able to impose such significant meaning on what really boils down to little more than a series of comedy skits strung together on an apparently flimsy clothesline of a plot Indeed the cinematic value of Modern Times is unquestionable but it is ironically noteworthy that such a simple and even blocky plot is made into such a memorable film experience and delivers such a strong timetranscending message about poverty stricken populations,10
1299,tt0027977,Hilarious touching anarchic revolutionary realist surreal of its time timeless  Modern Times is a multifaceted work of genius When its over and you recall the number of sight gags and magic sequences Chaplin has packed into  minutes it is incredible  the conveyer belt and nut turning; Chaplin caught in the cogwheels; the feeding machine; the Red Flag march; the nose powder; the roller skating ballet; the waiter with tray caught up in the dance my favourite; the gibberish song  and many more Then there is his mixing of silent and sound techniques making the best of both worlds not falling between stools as some directors might have doneOf course there is also a political and social dimension; many of the scenes refer to the impact of technical advances of bureaucracy and of the then current depression on the ordinary little man And it is the little man the individual caught up in societys complex machinery whom Chaplin championed He may have sympathised with leftwing political parties and unions in so far as they supported ordinary working people but Chaplins essential beliefs are enshrined in the final words and shot with him telling Paulette Godard that she should keep smiling they will get along as they walk a couple of individuals into an uncertain future Beyond politics the individual has to rely on his or her own resources and spirit to survive,0
1300,tt0027977,This movie is a must see for anyone who loves comedies  Charlie Chaplin is at his alltime best as the Tramp and he has wonderful chemistry with Paulette Goddards Gamin  Together they provide an hour and a half of nonstop laughs  My favorite parts are when he is fed by a modern machine that goes awry and then when Charlie goes crazy in the factory  The situations and expressions are hilarious!  Please see this movie soonyou definitely will not regret it,10
1301,tt0027977,Greetings from LithuaniaModern Times  is my first movie which i saw that features Charles Chaplin Saw it first time in  but nevertheless its a great movie Comedy here is truly funny and its not just a comedy It tells a story with some underlying themes that are still kinda topical till this day – technology is changing evolving and if you are not keeping pace with it you will have some hard times like our hero of this movieActing here is very solid actually i was surprised of how well acted this movie was – no one overreacted Story itself is interesting and movie is very well paced – at running time  h  min it almost never drags and is entertaining from start till finishOverall Modern Times is a black and white silent movie there are some sounds actually which safely can be viewed for the first time even in  –  years after its original release It has some truly genuine comedic situations it tells good story and pacing of picture is very solid Maybe it is not possible to review this movie correctly now because its very old but great movies are great movies – they can be viewed no matter what,9
1302,tt0027977,Chaplins Modern Times has influenced the th century as much as any other film could have His portrayal of man vs machine individual vs group love vs industryis the framework of classic modern American antiprogressive thinking Gilliams Brazil is the late century equivalent But Chaplin hit it right first insuring generations would have the chance to relate to the challenges of their own modern times,10
1303,tt0027977,Long after most people thought the silent movie had been buried forever Chaplin brought his Little Fellow out of mothballs for one more magnificent motion picture The Tramp is trapped in a factory performing mindnumbing repetitive tasks and finally he goes hilariously berserk I started laughing the instant I saw the lady in the dress with the buttons Like City Lights this film is a collection of charming vignettes this time revolving around The Tramps desire to settle down with gamin Paulette Goddard From the Tramps encounter with an assemblyline feeding machine to his unsuccessful stints as night watchman and waiter this movie is packed full of delights Chaplin never speaks but he does sing a little This work of genius can make you smile though your heart is breaking,0
1304,tt0027977,Charles Chaplin seemingly had been pushed out of the movie business by the earlys due to the advent of sound a medium that just never seemed right with him Chaplin probably the best filmmaker/performer of the th Century did not despair though He fought back with heart and emotion and by  Modern Times was a major box office and critical success It is a movie that quietly showed a man suffering through a world of change As a factory worker in the film Chaplin tries to cope with the industrial revolution and tries to make it through a quickly changing US economy He finds love with vagrant Paulette Goddard who ended up marrying Chaplin in real life and the two come together and lean on one another in a world of uncertainty and change Modern Times is one of those films that will put a smile on your face but it could make you weep just as easily Chaplins world was changing and not necessarily for the better from his point of view and he wanted to express the variations in his old way of doing things and the new way everyone else had accepted Goddard is also probably the best actress to match Chaplins charm in one of his pictures Their love for one another even though the marriage lasted a relatively short amount of time in real life just seems to shine on the silver screen and they have a chemistry that is sweet and heartwarming Beautifully made wonderfully written perfectly performed smart insightful and always brilliant Modern Times is another film from Chaplin that will brand itself on the souls of all true lovers of the cinema  stars out of ,0
1305,tt0027977,This is absolutely the finest film Charlie Chaplin ever madewhich considering the overall quality of his work says a great deal for the quality of the film  Genius is a much overused word but in Chaplins case its use is apt  This is one of the classics of cinema and one of the greatest films ever made!  The scenes in the factory are hilarious You have got to see this film!  Most joyously totally and highly RECOMMENDED!!!!!,10
1306,tt0027977,Somehow this very old film is particularly modern today and the exaggerations are not really sooo extreme compared with the real world The humans enslaved by the machines and by those who control them become more and more small and insignificant like the hero of this very funny comedy one of the best in the history that speaks about very ugly things in a very amusing way The Tramp is not a tramp in the beginning He has a real job in a modern factory that almost kills him as the factory becomes more and more modern He becomes a tramp when he stays without a job Picking up red flags in the street can get you in a big problem with the police who are there to serve and protect the rich An honest man can stay honest even in prison and get benefits from this Even a new job But honesty is not really enough Trouble is always around the corner and modern society doesnt permit you to make a new start easilyLove gives you wings or at list hope and the power to continue A beautiful girl of the streets is more than our hero is asking for and he is ready to do whatever necessary Even put his safety in danger to take care of her And she appreciates this In the end when everything is lost once again all they are left with is each other and thats all they really needFor the first time is his cinema career our Tramp will find a girl that will stick with him and support him Chaplin obviously felt with Paulette Goddard something that he didnt feel for his earlier women and I dont blame himAnd this story of modern times like all of Chaplins films will end up with an optimistic feeling in a unhappy end Never is everything lostWith obvious inspiration from Fritz Langs Metropolis and maybe René Clairs À nous la liberté it made the strongest point about THE where we re going in all the cinema of the s I think  and with only Marx bros Duck soup being able to stand anywhere close to it Maybe the most complete funny and mature creation of the best comedian of the seventh art with a lot more than a non stop production line of great jokes to offer If made without a single joke this film would still be one of the greatest of all of our modern times,10
1307,tt0027977,Modern Times begins with a shot of sheep going down a runway followed by a shot of workers entering a factory Charlie is set down in the midst of industrial civilization which is dominated by machinery and in which men are organized into mechanical units Capital and Labor Charlies real enemies are no longer the Cop or the Boss with whom he can always enter into some human relation but a vast impersonality invisible and invulnerable Modern Times offered a variety of minor attractions it featured Chaplins wife Paulette Goddard; it had wonderful gags; it indulged in tricks of sound which came to the very edge of being dialog But what did the picture mean what was it trying to say? Because Chaplin charged his usual enormous percentage for it and because of foreign receipts Modern Times made money but exhibitors were not happy at the limited audience turnout For the majority the new Charlie was too serious; for the minority not serious enoughSince the picture seemed to be about the dehumanizing effect of machinery intellectuals called upon Chaplin to join them in reorganizing machine culture to some more human scale of thingsOff the screen Chaplin said nothing On the screen his anarchic hostility for any kind of machine culture expressed itself in scenes like that in which Charlie is fed by a machine and that in which crazed by the assembly line he runs into the street his arms moving convulsively like two pistons Charlie the rebel Charlie the poet Charlie the invincibly human had been turned into a machine,8
1308,tt0027977,Modern Times exemplifies Depressionera America; a stream of disappointments tattered dreams and missed chances that attempt to drag the characters down but are defied by the ever buoyant hope of the American DreamScenes from Modern Times aptly capture the mood of America in the late s; men superimposed by sheep shuttled into a waiting line workers being pushed to go faster and faster eventually consumed by the very machine they deigned to control Yet elements of optimism shine through the weary filmChaplin and his gamin dream of a home of their own with cows ready to be milked and steaks crackling on the stove Though their realitya depilated shack Is no Buckingham Palace the two are able to sustain themselves on the American Dream of a more secure fruitful lifeSeveral aspects of the film called to mind a type reality Though  was written in   years after the birth of Modern Times including the large two way screen in the factory allowing the owner to be Big Brother to the workers as well as the police brutality and Ford factory line of men and machineThe film ends appropriately; dusty and bruised from pursuit hardship and hunger Chapin and his orphan girl head of hopefully into the sunset convinced of a better reality awaiting them on the suns return; a hope shared by many in Americas Modern Times,7
1309,tt0027977,I saw this as a child and my laughter at the feeding machine scene was so WILD that I have never laughed so hard at anything again in my entire life I literally slid out of my chair to the ground gasping for air The whole film is absurd and brilliant crisply realized by a comedy genius but for me that one moment transcends even greatness and touches the sublime where is poetry and God Seeing the feeding machine again as an adult there are tears mixed with laughter To eat is to live it is the personal realm and the invasion of the authoritarian state into the personal realm is so arrogant and pompous that it frightens me a lot to see how far it has gone as they regulate our speech our food our sex lives according to the latest PC doctrines of nice Chaplin would not have recognized this new world of ours where the working class he represents here is ruled by progressive billionaires spouting inanities,10
1310,tt0027977,The hands of the cinema clock were set back five years last night when a funny little man with a microscopic mustache a battered derby hat turned up shoes and a flexible bamboo cane returned to the Broadway screen to resume his place in the affections of the filmgoing public The little man—it scarcely needs be said—is Charlie Chaplin whose Modern Times opening at the Rivoli restores him to a following that has waited patiently burning incense in his temple of comedy during the long years since his last picture was producedThat was five years ago almost to the day City Lights was its name and in it Mr Chaplin refused to talk He still refuses But in Modern Times he has raised the ban against dialogue for other members of the cast raised it but not completely A few sentences here and there excused because they come by television phonograph the radio And once—just once—Mr Chaplin permits himself to be heardThose are the answers to the practical questions They do not tell of Mr Chaplins picture or of Chaplin himself or of the comic feast that he has been preparing for almost two years in the guarded cloister in Hollywood known as the Chaplin studioBut there is no cause for alarm and no reason to delay the verdict further Modern Times has still the same old Charlie the lovable little fellow whose hands and feet eyebrows can beat an irresistible tattoo upon an audiences or hold it still taut beneath the spell of human tragedy A flick of his cane a quirk of a brow an impish lift of his toe and the mood is off; a droop of his mouth a sag of his shoulder a quick blink of his eye and you are his again a companion in suffering Or do you have to be reminded that Chaplin is a master of pantomime? Time has not changed his genius,10
1311,tt0027977,The mechanized and standardized world made of levers bolts department stores and lifts is too difficult or probably too ordinary for the honest and trustworthy Charlie Chaplin who always ends up trapped in his times But did this world really change a lot when nowadays we walk to the subway or we drive in crowded streets like cattle in order to reach our working place? In fact what Charlie Chaplin and the beautiful Paulette Goddard a close up of her face after The Little Tramp is arrested for the theft of a loaf of bread is magnificent really wants from modern times is a small decent house where to have dinner together an apple to grab by stretching your arm outside the window and fresh milk from a cow Charlie Chaplin doesnt need to speak on the screen while talking pictures were already widely produced since late s to deliver his brilliant view on s world; and even when he does talk during the floor show towards the end of the movie we dont need to understand what it is said to appreciate once more his talent and genius There are two moments that stand out during the movie the feeding machine that feeds The Little Tramp on the assembly line in the first part of Modern Times note also some similarities later when the mechanic assistant feeds his boss And the splendid final scene when before fading out The Little Tramp invites The Gamin to smile while walking on an empty street at dawn; a scene that alone is worth a full movie a smile that becomes the essence of the use of trying This last moment is full of hope and full of humanity; things that we still struggle for in our modern times,9
1312,tt0027977,Modern Times owes a lot to Metropolis despite the difference in tone You can see this especially in the first half with the giant gears and flywheels of the monstrous factory as well as the twoway TV intercom the boss uses to give ordersAlthough there is a lot of serious content  strikes riots poverty police killings  the serious and comic elements blend seamlessly You never get the feeling youre being lectured about anything youre laughing too muchThe element of tragedy lurking in the background makes the comedy that much stronger When Paulette Godard comes into the picture the tone changes from industrial to romantic And it must be said that she is one of the sexiest heroines to appear in an American film more surprising since its a farce Id go so far as to say that Godard outperforms Chaplin in this picture even if her later career was less notableYou have to see this movie before you can understand anything about the art of cinema,10
1313,tt0027977,Arguably Charlies best film  Maybe not his funniest but his best because theres so much more to it than the Keystone Kops kind of pratfalls that he so commonly usedFrankly I dont know how the guy did it being so consistently humorous without using any words  All of it depends on a story simple enough to be followed visually and on Chaplins genius for mime and situation construction  There ARE some words spoken on screen  this was his last holdout against talking pictures  but none of them involve people speaking directly to one another  There is a song at the end with gibberish lyrics And the rest of the speaking is always filtered through some mechanical medium a record player a radio a television set  Charlie was accused of communism somewhere along the line and pretty much thrown out of the country after which he lived in Switzerland  You couldnt tell he was a Commie from this movie  It comments on its time of course the Great Depression and Charlie and Paulette Goddard are two poor people  Management is shown as callus playing with a jigsaw puzzle and reading newspapers while the workers slave away on the assembly line  There is even a communist demonstration  But its all played for laughs  One of those red warning flags falls off the back of a truck passing down an empty street  Charlie picks up the flag and waves it shouting after the truck As he begins to hurry after the truck still shouting and waving a horde of dissatisfied workers silently falls in behind him and hes arrested  Poor people steal but they only steal food  If having sympathy for the unemployed is communism then roughly one American out of three was a communist because thats roughly what the unemployment rate was  Modern Times is no more communistic than say My Man Godfrey or Salt of the Earth or The Grapes of Wrath  Besides that Charlie is no classical Marxist  Marxism posited a transition from false consciousness the feeling that ones miserable poverty was due to personal failure or bad luck to class consciousness the realization that exploitation by the property owners was at fault  Charlie is no activist  He fumbles every job he gets  The other workers are hardly sympathetic  Charlies not a working class hero but a black sheep  The opening shot of the herd of sheep hurrying past the camera includes one black sheep in the middle of the flock and its hard to imagine that this was accidentalActually Charlie had lost a lot of respect in America because he had an eye for young girls  His second marriage resulted from a sixteenyearold girls faked pregnancy  Paulette Goddard who became his third wife maybe and maybe not was twenty when this movie was made and Charlie was fortythree  In any case  boy if you want to get Americans heated up just combine sex with politics  A surefire winner for the puritans  It may have cost Goddard the part of Scarlet OHara in Gone With the Wind because she may have been living in sin with Charlie at the timeI dont want to spell out too many of the gags because I dont want to spoil them but be alert for the feeding machine that goes berserk and shoves lug nuts down Charlies throat and hits him in the face with a corn cob Charlie looks as if hes strapped helplessly into his seat but his hands were free under the rotating table so that he could manipulate the fiendish devices himself  The first time I saw this movie was in the Arts Theater on Springfield Avenue in Irvington New Jersey  When Paulette Goddard first appeared the man on my right chuckled and said Now thats a goodlooking babe  On my left my marmorial ex laughed out loud during the feeding machine episode for perhaps the only time in her life  There can be no higher recommendation,0
1314,tt0027977,Usually you watch old films trying to be generous with your criticism because of the huge difficulties the directors and actors faced those days This one is a miracle A comedy that stands tall even in todays cinema starring perhaps the best comedian who lived on earth At some parts it is hilarious but the social message Chaplin wants to pass is always there making Modern Times even more important The love story is also very sweet and Paulette Goddard is a remarkably beautiful woman! So what to say about this mans genius? Charlie Chaplin acts directs and even composes the music! And by all means he does a magnificent job You can find great symbolism and a lot of political references we all have to remember that Chaplin was accused of being a communist which of course was a pride for intellectuals given their accusers I have unlimited respect for the Great Charlie Chaplin,9
1315,tt0027977,This is where I decided to have a look at Charlie Chaplin and his famous Modern times  we are all familiar with scenes in a factory but honestly there is much much more happening later and it truly surprised me that film turns into a such epic saga Another example of things I just assumed I know It charmed me instantly of course because Chaplin was a true genius and magician  his creation Little Tramp is easily understood to anybody no matter what background and we love him dearly for all his sweetness clumsiness and old heart This story apparently happens in Metropolislike factory where work machines and buttons are parodied mercilessly until we audience roar with laughter  I was honestly surprised that something filmed almost a century ago was still so fresh and funny Basically everything after the first start on the fast track was new to me and I laughed and laughed until I found myself rewinding scenes and enjoying them again What a genius!Once Little Tramp looses his job  there is a whole unspoken atmosphere of unfairness poverty and depression around  he quickly ends up in a prison from which he doesnt even want to leave However he gets Cocaine in his salt Charlie Chaplin on a Coke! saves policemen from escaped criminals meets ministers wife very funny scene and gets release from the prison with job recommendation letter And this is still just a beginning of the movie! There is much much more coming up later  it really goes on forever but its wonderful heartwarming and joyous to watch I almost forgot everything about myself and my whereabouts while I was so deeply lost in this masterpiece Film is so immensely rich with characters stories little details and magic that I honestly think its one of the best things I have ever seen,10
1316,tt0027977,The Tramp Charlie Chaplin is just a cog in the modern machinery He is unable to keep with the production line tightening bolts The owner picks him out for testing the automatic feeding machine By late afternoon he gets lost in the machinery He cant stop tightening causing great damage and they send him to a mental hospital He gets out but he doesnt have a job anymore A red flag falls off the back of a truck He picks it and a massive march starts behind him without he knowing it The police grabs him thinking that hes the leader In prison he helps thwart an escape attempt and is released A Gamin Paulette Goddard is stealing food for the children Her unemployed father is shot dead leaving her little sisters sent off to the orphanage She steals a loaf of bread and runs into the Tramp He tries to take the blame but shes caught anyways He prefers life inside and deliberately gets caught stealing They get thrown into the same wagon and escape getting thrown out togetherThis has the iconic factory scene with the Tramp in the machinery happening early on The story is slightly random as the pair has one misadventure after another as they struggle to have the American dream The Tramp is making a statement of sorts as he gets swept up from one thing to the next Hes the cog that never really fits in the machinery This is a sound movie with sound being used for specific and interesting ways The Tramp is actually singing but its a lot of nonsense This definitely has a social commentary but its still funny message movie,9
1317,tt0027977,A delightful film with one great scene after another Charlie Chaplins Modern Times is hilarious thoughtful and timeless  Chaplin combined his silent film skills with creative use of sound effects and music and added a wide variety of interesting and entertaining settings to create a film that is very pleasing to watch  Chaplins own fine acting is complemented by a delightful and charming performance by Paulette Goddard  And the story itself filled with twists and turns is a timeless commentary on modern life much of which is applicable to any eraCharlies Tramp character joins up in this one with a lively orphaned gamin Goddard to help each other through a lengthy series of setbacks and triumphs that reflect the stresses of fastpaced modern life  Most of their adventures are hilarious but many also contain serious social commentary that is still just as relevant in any age  Chaplin and Goddard make a delightful pair who win the complete sympathy of the viewer in their fight for survivalThe movie has one great scene after another from some wild sequences in a steel factory to a set of sometimes breathtaking antics in a deserted department store to the incomparable climactic sequence in a cafe and many others in between  The settings are done with great care and wit and the action makes full use of the props and possibilities at handThis is a wonderful movie that anyone who likes vintage cinema will enjoy Even those who are thoroughly jaded by the excesses of modern cinema should at least give Modern Times a try  This is one of the great masterpieces of Chaplins or any other era,0
1318,tt0031381,This film shows the best of the American cinema Whether we like the film or not one has to recognize the greatest achievement perhaps of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry Gone with the Wind represents a monumental leap as well as a departure for the movies as they were done prior to this filmThe vision of David O Selznick the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchells massive account about the South before and after the Civil War pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the warGone with the Wind brought together the best people in Hollywood The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen Of course credit must be due to the director Victor Fleming and his vision as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard who gave the right tone to the film The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movieOne cant conceive another Scarlett OHara played by no one but Vivien Leigh Her beauty her sense of timing her intelligent approach to this role makes this a hallmark performance Ms Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows Scarlett goes from riches to rags back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didnt know she possessed Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her RhettThe same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie This is a mans man Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency His love for Scarlett the woman he knows is in love with a dream speaks eloquently for itselfThe other two principals Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard give performances that are amazing to watch Ms de Havillands Melanie Hamilton is perfect Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley Mr Howards Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife while Scarlett keeps tempting himThe rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful Ms McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing This huge talent is a joy to watchComments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie but being realistic this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities such as the slavery were the norm of the land While those things are repugnant to acknowledge in the film they are kept at a minimum After all this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South Margaret Mitchell who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American historyEnjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor,10
1319,tt0031381,Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind I was well acquainted with Max Steiners theme It opened WOR TVs Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGMs rereleases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar MovieMillion Dollar Movie is gone now but Gone With the Wind book and film remain eternal In these days Margaret Mitchells southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher let alone selling film rights to the story But it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyones mind who reads the novel or sees the film And thats just about the same because I cant think of another film that remained so faithful to the textIt is said that Margaret Mitchell wrote the book with Clark Gable in mind as Rhett Butler As the sober and ever realistic but charming Rhett Gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen However in the last half hour of the film when hes hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness Gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently If Mitchell knew who she wanted as Rhett nobody knew who would be Scarlett The search for Scarlett OHara is one of those Hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of Edna May Oliver read for the part Gone With the Wind started filming without a Scarlett as the famous burning of Atlanta sequence was done first While it was being down David O Selznick settled on a fairly unknown British actress at least in the USA Vivien LeighIt was a stroke of casting genius Vivien Leighs screen output is pretty small she was primarily a stage actress Gone With the Wind is more her film than Rhett Butlers The story is her story how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living shes become accustomed to from the preCivil War era In the process she helps all those around her economically but loses all their previous affection Ive always felt the key scene in the film is after Leslie Howard tells Leigh hell be marrying Olivia DeHavilland and Leigh makes a fool of herself with him she finds out that Clark Gable has overheard the whole thing Hes fascinated by her but because of that hes on to all her ploysLeslie Howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads His Ashley Wilkes is not all that different from Alan Squire in The Petrified Forest Imagine Squire as a wealthy plantation owner and youve Ashley Hes stronger than he realizes though hes the one that reluctantly enlists in the Confederate Army while the cynical Rhett Butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runnerIve always felt however that the most difficult acting job in Gone With the Wind was the role of Melanie Hamilton Olivia DeHavilland after initially considering trying out for Scarlett decided to go after Melanie Its a deceptive part superficially its a lot like the crinoline heroines DeHavilland was doing at Warner Brothers Melanie is the counterpoint to Scarlett an incredibly kind and decent soul who cant see bad in anyone One of her best scenes is with Ona Munson who is Belle Watling the most prominent madam in Atlanta The other women of society snub her but DeHavilland accepts her help for the Confederate cause Its not about politics or slavery for Melanie her husband is at war and his cause is hersAnd DeHavillands death scene would move the Medusa to tears Its a great tribute to the playing skill of Olivia DeHavilland in that Melanie NEVER becomes a maudlin character She got her first Oscar nomination for Melanie in the Supporting Actress category but lost it to fellow cast member Hattie McDaniel as Scarletts mammyHatties a shrewd judge of character shes a slave but shes also a family confidante of the OHaras As Gable says shes one of the few people he knows whose respect he wantsOf course Gone With the Wind is from the southern point of view Growing up in Atlanta Margaret Mitchell heard reminisces from many Confederate veterans and the stories they told found their way into Gone With the Wind Its about what the white civilian population endured during the war and ReconstructionDavid O Selznick got a bit of irony in there though Please note during the burning of Atlanta the slaves who are being marched out to dig trenches are singing Let My People Go And thats just what the Union Army was coming to Atlanta to doGone With the Wind copped so many Oscars for  that Bob Hope quipped at the Academy Awards ceremony that it was a benefit for David O Selznick Of course it was the Best Picture of  and Vivien Leigh won the first of her two Best Actress AwardsMetroGoldwynMayer kept itself in the black for years by simply rereleasing Gone With the Wind Unlike any other classic film it won new generations of fans with theatrical rerelease Somewhere on this planet there are people seeing this  year old classic and it is winning new fans as I write thisAnd I think Gone With the Wind the telling of the interwoven lives of Rhett Scarlett Ashley and Melanie and the world they knew will be something viewed and read hundreds of years from now,10
1320,tt0031381,Margaret Mitchells Gone with the Wind in its true essence is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence Victor Flemings rendition of the classic novel a classic within its own right does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchells evocative masterpiece In the words of Mitchell herself Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War visàvis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survivalScarlet OHara the well bred haughty tempestuous and opportunistic protagonist of the saga is an ostensibly flawed individual whose inexorable urge to placate her ego and realize her fancies appears far stronger than her adherence to any credence pious to her people and relevant to her time Her scintillating charm and unrestrained zeal not only make her an object of desire for her male counterparts but also an object of envy for the girls around herVivian Leigh perfectly fits into the caricature of Scarlet OHara She makes full use of her talent courage and guile to portray a part that requires subtlety brusqueness and poise in equal parts It may sound like a hyperbole but no other actress seemed better equipped to play the part a southern belle than Leigh herself who won not one but two Oscars while playing one first for her portrayal of Scarlet OHara and second for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire opposite Marlon Brando In fact her portrayal of Scarlet OHara in which she perfectly blends panache poignancy and peremptoriness is arguably the greatest portrayal by a female lead in cinematic history Leigh uses her onstage experience to improvise in order to add new dimensions and complexities to Scarlets caricature which according to the novel was mostly one dimensional outandout bad Scarlets stubbornness and her impish obsession for a conformist like Ashley who is not only indifferent to her feelings but also incapable of reciprocating the passion and zeal with which she pursues him represent just one dimension of her multifaceted self which is revealed layer by layer with the progression of the narrative The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars a usurper an egomaniac a damsel a nemesis a menace a guardian a savior a patriot a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhoodClark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leighs larger than life portrayal He is an outright reprobate an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures However behind this facade just like Scarlet there is a human capable of love and worthy of being loved These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland who as Melanie is a paragon of love humility and forgiveness She provides a striking contrast to Scarlets caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhoodThe movies direction cinematography editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece one to be savored till eternity The movie is an amalgam of scenes high on emotion and drama which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout The scene in which Scarlets father tells her the importance of mother land deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for is pure gold Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy Butlers famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet You should be kissed and often and by someone who knows how also happens to be one of all time favorite The movie especially its anticlimatic ending brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergoPS Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinemas greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinemas timelessness and its limitless potential A must watch for everyone /http//wwwapotpourriofvestigescom/,10
1321,tt0031381,Ive seen the film many times have always enjoyed it But Ive been reading the book for the first time Its a very long novel and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending Its a good read but Margaret Mitchell former newspaper reporter is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it Its the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick Not what parts to film but which parts to leave out So many characters that appeared in the book couldnt be introduced in the movie without extending the films length to well over four hours So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed Selznick was close to running out of money so he asked his angel millionaire Jock Whitney to loan him enough to finish the film The film was finally completed and edited then was testmarketed at a theatre not far from LA The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards which allowed Selznick to rest easy knowing he had a hit on his hands,9
1322,tt0031381,The setting is a Georgia plantation The year is  and sixteenyearold Scarlett OHara is infatuated with the blond drowsyeyed Ashley Wilkes  the problem is Ashley plans to marry another woman Little matter that every other man in the county is courting Scarlett and that a charming scoundrel named Rhett Butler is staring at her with questionable intent  she cares only for AshleySuddenly the Civil War brakes out changing the fates and fortunes of all Scarlett clever manipulative and charming proves an adept survivor  but what will she have to do to survive? And will she ever learn whom it is that she really loves?GWTW is one of the most meticulously cast films ever; with the possible exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley in his forties rather old to be playing a man half that age every role was perfectly assigned After you watch Vivien Leigh you will be unable to imagine anyone else playing Scarlett and Hattie McDaniels strong unforgettable performance as Mammy netted her an academy award the first for an AfricanAmerican actor,10
1323,tt0031381,It is always in peoples nature to put down great things and to nitpick or sometimes just be plain mean No matter what anyone says this is utterly fantastic in story in special effects in casting with perhaps the sad exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley and in captivation Vivien Leigh is so powerful passionate magnificent and beautiful that you could watch it  times on that ground alone She brings something so convincing and human to the role of the selfish spoilt Scarlett; the character is larger than lifeLeaving Viviens astounding performance aside this remains a sweeping unrivalled epic Watch it Esthers rating /,8
1324,tt0031381,I believe that when one views a film one should consider the context in which it was madeBarely  years after talking pictures were first created; less than that after the first fulllength color feature film was created; near the end of the greatest depression this country ever experienced and in which pretty much the only entertainment available to most was radio or the movies; David O Selznik decided to turn the biggest potboiler blockbuster novel into a movieAnd what a movie Stunning color the most popular mail actor of his time perfect music score incredible action scenes story line only  years removed from when it happened and on and on Can you imagine what a storeclerk or a farmer or a teacher experienced in that world seeing Gone With the Wind? What was there to compare with?  was a watershed year for great movies and this one was the greatest produced Try watching this movie as if there were no TV no DVDs only a few radio stations spending maybe the second to the last quarter you owned never having seen such a movie before and you get what I mean Masterful for its time and still timeless today,10
1325,tt0031381,Every time I watch this film and Ive seen it more times than I can remember Im always astonished by the freshness of the story the power of the emotions it conveys and the beautiful detailed images of a time long gone That this film was made in the s is almost incomprehensible to me The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to life must have been monumental But come to life it did and still does! A triumph of filmmaking ingenuity and genius that will live on for many generations to come,10

1329,tt0031381,For some nostalgic dreamers Gone With the Wind is a glorious swan song depicting the fall of the South during a devastating Civil War and its reconstruction on the ashes of the Old Order a Civilization forever gone with the wind Its the adaptation of Margaret Mitchells epic tale written in bold letters with this peculiar ability to portray the Yankees as the bad guys so common in the stories related by Southerners as they invite us to understand their idealism if not to root for it a vision of Gallantry and Old European Nobility where women were courted wives were submissive to their husbands and slaves treated with paternalismBut for some idealistic spirits Gone With the Wind resonates as one of the most heartbreaking pages of American History when the North fought the South in the name of Liberty Freedom and Justice and when History written by the victorious side ultimately showed the Confederate as the ones who were wrong Gone With the Wind chronicles what the South used to be a world where coexisted two cultures the Whites and the Colored And the depiction of the slaves oscillates between the high pitched voice of the simpleminded Prissy Butterfly McQueen who knew nothing about birthin babies and the wisdom and authority of Mammy Hattie McDaniel in her Oscarwinning role two figures two extremes so rooted in our hearts its impossible to dislike them despite the obvious stereotypesFor literate minds History is only the setting while the film is an incredible achievement in storytelling inviting us to follow a gallery of magnificent and appealing characters during a slice of life where the passing of time can be felt when History affects story with mercy or ruthlessness sometimes tragic sometimes ironic Its a narrative whose emotional core is the heroine Scarlett OHara Vivien Leigh whose heart belongs to the charming blonde Ashley Wilkes Leslie Howard married to the gentle and extremely goodhearted cousin Melanie Hamilton Olivia de Havilland A triangular love that sets the personality of Scarlett as a remarkable antiheroine selfish greedy jealous but so brave courageous and generous when the circumstances of War forever changed the face of the South A great soul that could only be revealed by a great opportunity a pivotal metamorphosis incarnated by the iconic As God is my witness Ill never be hungry againThe fascinating aspect of Scarletts personality is that her flaws elevated her above all the other characters she doesnt care for etiquette for traditions her spirit is free her ego is big and her heart so vulnerable While the South is definitely turned to the past Scarlett thinks of the future as she says after all tomorrow is another day Scarlett is a modern figure and thats what makes her so appealing both in the film and to the audience And Rhett Butler Clark Gable in his most defining role as the visitor from Charleston is Scarlets perfect match Both dont belong to that era they think of money greed prosperity and passion They embody all the values that America would stand for transcending the oldfashioned setting of the South But like the Souths enthusiasm for War the same pride that drives their passion would ruin their relationshipsFor many passionate hearts this is one of the most intense romances ever adapted to the big screen a frustrating and seemingly impossible love between two strongminded egos two faces staring at each other as if they were at the verge of an irresistible passion or about to fight each other As Scarlett was visibly jealous of Melanie when she went to bed with Ashley the movie makes you penetrate the soul of these characters with such intensity you could feel she wished that Melanie could die A childish and immature attitude probably shared with Butler who wouldnt have minded if Ashley could die in the War too The love between Rhett and Scarlett is made of the same idealism that built the South myth a lost but so endearing cause a fire that burnt inside and made pretty fitting that the most intimate and sensual moment they had was under the orange sky during Atlantas big fire Love has never been as passionate as a loveandhate relationship and never seemed a romance so comparable to a lost cause mirroring the Southerners very faith in victory Rhetts last stand when he takes Scarlett up the stairs in the one night she wouldnt turn him out is the perfect illustration of a love that pumped its energy from hate and anger As Scarlett lost in her love for Ashley will never realize that her man is Rhett and when she does Rhett is already fed up and finally delivers the most unforgettable comeuppance ever Frankly my dear I dont give a damn before disappearing in a foggy mist Scarlett gets a magnificent lesson about life and wouldnt have been as likable without this last slap in the face This I dont give a damn voted # in the American Film Institutes Top  Movie quotes was Rhetts revenge and he sure deserved it and many wannabeScarlett would admit that tooBut while Gone With the Wind deals with lost causes its more than anything the triumph of Cinema as the most defining Art of the last century Echoing the novels status as a best seller its one of the greatest films of all time the greatest casting ever the greatest score and the greatest challenge for superlatives Victor Flemings superproduction that would become a landmark in filmmaking with its unique visual style and beautiful cinematography in colors forever incarnated by Scarletts shadowy silhouette standing beside a tree during a beautiful sunset Along with The Wizard of Oz and Mr Smith Goes to Washington Gone With the Wind is probably Hollywoods Golden Age reaching its pinnacle before the War would come in  ,10

1331,tt0031381,Gone With the Wind is without a doubt one of the most magnificent romances ever A realistic fiction that ends abruptly and leaves its viewer/reader starving for more but unfortunately never produced a sequel A book was written in the s that continued the story but trust me it sucked Scarlett was such a complex character selfish spirited passionate about everything she wants But in the end you see that Scarlett changes she learns about communication and respect for all those who love her after she lost everyone who did Never read the sequel if you read the first one because it isnt a Margaret Mitchell novel and therefor you wont SEE the complexity Those of you who voted for this movie to have one star I pity you You cannot see the complexity or beauty of this wonderful tale or you just didnt see it and decided to vote for a movie you thought would be stupid when in fact it is the most popular civil war movie in history Please support this movie and give it FAIR votes It won ten Oscars and has claim to one of the most amazing casts ever so take that into consideration plus the effort it took when you give this movie a one/ten It deserves so much more,10
1332,tt0031381,There has never been any movie in the cinema history that was more a legend than Gone with the wind It is undeniable that this movie contains lots of goofs but despite all this it is a blockbuster and a real masterpiece Completely NOT overratedI love this movie I cant explain why exactly There are sooo many reasons I first saw it when I was a little kid and still cant forget it Its so special if you can return to movie even when you had seen it more than  times And GWTW is this kind of a movieIn my opinion a movie can not be a good when the acting is not good And there acting is great! Every character is portrayed so magnificently!I will start with the supporting players Barbara ONeil though only  while filming played mother of quite adult daughters She was the Ellen Robillard Mitchell descirbed in her book so stative so smart so lady Thomas Mitchell should have received Oscar for his Gerald OHara portroyal and I think he did not just because he won for Stagecoach that year Scarletts sisters are really well cast But the best supporting performance of the film is this one of Hattie McDaniels She is simply magnificent moving and unforgettable as Mummy Just amazingMany people claim that Leslie Howard did not fit the role of Ashley They may be right in some sense but lets think it over twice Ashley was more handsome as Mitchell described him but he was a dreamer who could not find himself in a new cruel world And Howard showed this quality as best as possibleOf course Olivia de Havillands performance of Melanie was as worth of Oscar as Hattie McDaniels but later on she was given what she deserved Oscars for To each his own and The Heiress She plays Melanie with such a sensibility but she manages to show her hidden strength but not in a dominate way Clark Gable was so unsure of his talent till the end of his life I think that he was a great actor Hes so real as Rhett and he has to play several dramatic scenes And he does it perfectlyremember that playing those scenes like those after Scarletts miscarriage needed acting talent Hes perfect But I wont hide my opinion that Vivien Leighs Scarlett is the best and most powerful point of the whole movie Vivien won the role when she was completely unknown She managed to master the Southern accent as well She did not play Scarlett She WAS Scarlett But only in this movie She never acted any other character the same way She is terrific and has all those features that original Mitchells Scarlett possesses I heard that she wanted to play the part exactly as Mitchell created it and Fleming wanted her to play it just as a bitch so they fought about it badly but finally Vivien did a great work and her Oscar was something very obviousIf you love good cinema if you want to see something moving and something that is not getting old though almost ! do not miss it,10
1333,tt0031381,Gone with the Wind is one of the greatest American classics ever made It tells the story of Scarlett OHara played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh She is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still care for her She is in love with Ashley Wilkes Leslie Howard but he marries to Melanie Hamilton She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance A new man in Scarletts life is Rhett Butler Clark Gable but Scarlett does everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and her own benefit Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart mainly because they are much the same They both think the world is there for them Melanie and Scarlett become friendsThe movie is set in the time of the Civil War What happens exactly with Scarlett Rhett Ashley and Melanie is for you to see but the war is pretty important for the story and the way it is used is great The story itself is great anyway Although the movie is long it is never boring A reason for that is the performances I already mentioned Olivia de Havilland Clark Gable is very good charming and sometimes funny Hattie McDaniel as the black made is outstanding but I have to say that the best thing in this movie is Vivien Leigh To make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do but she makes it seem so easy It is one of the strongest performances I have seenBesides the story and the acting we have the music the sets the costumes the cinematography and of course the direction It is all great It was made in  and over  years later it still is a very impressive movie,10
1334,tt0031381,I watched this movie for the first time at fourteen years old I enjoyed it immensely I have always been a fanatic for anything Civil War themed so when my mother recommended it to me it was a yes from the start The opening scenes show the young Scarlett OHara as she awaits her fathers arrival Beloved in the eyes of all the men in the county Scarlett has acquired a high selfesteem but when the War is announced to come after all the highspirited Scarlett soon faces obstacles that are determined to destroy her faith and her hope She meets many people along the way she even gets married With new relationships new responsibilities come as well Rhett Butler a man determined to have Scarlett for his own comes into her life half way through both the novel and the movie and he fights her on topics such as love politics and societal roles Even after the Civil War Scarlett is still faced with many decisions She has faced death marriage and defeat many times Still willing to go on even when it seemed impossible Scarlett leaves us with the last quote of the novel and book After all tomorrow is another day,10
1335,tt0031381,If you have ever considered GWTW to be less than a masterpiece youll be swayed by the th Anniversary Edition DVD The disc set features the remastered film and more extras than you could possibly watch in one day after watching the film of course The twohour makingof documentary is fascinating and shows how the producer David O Selznick of the film affected the cast directors and writers  and shows the publicity frenzy that was the hunt for Scarlett The feature of Olivia De Havilland in  discussing her role as Melanie is a real treat The picture and sound are great on the th Anniversary DVD and the special features are a true treasure Accept no substitutes seek out the th Anniversary DVD and bring it home,10
1336,tt0031381,Here is how I feel about Gone With the Wind My moms side of the family is Southern They lived mostly around where Scarlett and her gang hung out Some had plantations and owned slaves My grandparents were old fashioned in the clueless way Margaret Mitchell was Ive heard their side lots of times and I found it to be wrong If I were Black I wouldnt like to pass by statues erected to past oppressors either nor would I want to have flags in my face constantly reminding me of a sorrowful pastHowever please consider this If youre going to get upset at GWTW and ban showing it then you would also want to eliminate the rest of the movies from back then which show stereotypes as well correct? Unfortunately ALMOST ALL probably about  of Black roles for the stage and screen pres were just as racist as in GWTW many were worseThe problem is if you get rid of these movies you erase the work of any Black actors back then as well You wont see why Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar for a performance in a land so bigoted she could not sit in the audience during the premiere You wont see lots of superb singing dancing and acting by any AfricanAmerican during this time They will be completely ignored because of the contextYou wind up punishing all these people who wanted to work in entertainment and had little influence over the roles they played as well as those whites who made those moviesAnd Hollywood whitewashes and pretties up EVERYTHING It always has Dont get upset because they did it for the millionth time in GWTWConsider the movie  about ancient Sparta There was no mention of slaves they owned or the organized pedophilia that went into the training of boys Google it if you dont know what Im talking aboutAnd yet there were no mass protests at the rose colored vision in the movie No one came to picket the film because it omitted a horrendous flaw in Spartan societyWhy? Well for one thing that was well over  years ago What happened in Sparta is no longer directly relevant to anyone No normal modern army expects raping young boys as part of their trainingIts no longer relevantUnfortunately GWTW IS STILL RELEVANT Many of the problems portrayed in this film and any film from back then with Black actors are still haunting the US Denying that there is anything wrong and everything is just fine and has been fixed is simply denying realityWhy do I care? Unfortunately GWTW is one of my favorite books and films It has a strong still unique story of feminism I can relate to That is what is relevant to me in the film I have tended in the past to brush aside the slave part because it seems surreal to me to own people Im certainly not sitting there hoping the good ol days can come back I like the modern world with its aim of acceptance and tolerance I get the feeling the vast majority of viewers feel the same wayHow do we solve this problem? When Blacks are truly integrated and that day will come then GWTW will no longer be that relevant It wont strike any raw nerves The protests will die down just as they have for every other hot button issue whos time has come and goneTrue classics never die GWTW has many redeeming features which have made it endlessly entertaining to me and thousands of other people Keep talking about it show the movie now and then with perhaps a short lecture on history and context before and know that in time the pain will fadeALSO KEEP IN MIND when you criticize Scarlett for her actions there was NO OTHER WAY to survive in the Victorian world if you were a woman other than SEDUCING A MAN Its not like she could go off to college and get a degree Women were NOT allowed to own land have a bank accountvote hold a job besides perhaps a hat maker or much more commonly a prostitute etc If she seems strange for marrying men she didnt lovekeep in mind it was that or be totally broke and homelessMuch of the criticism of her character comes from total lack of knowledge about this contextAs for the movie itself I first saw it when I was thirteen It made quite an impression Forty years or so later it still moves me Some people criticize the main character Scarlett because shes not nice Shes not typical of a main female characterScarlett behaves in an uncomfortably realistic way Shes not a nice lady she is a superrare female antihero Shes not comfortingly evil but shes never going to be a goody two shoes Some people dont know how to handle thatMelanie on the other hand is criticized for being unrealistic I would ask anyone who thinks that to understand the context of the times she lived in There was no mass media save for the local newspaper and that was hardly an international trove of information as they are now No TV no radio no internet A person could grow up to be innocent in a way we simply dont experience in modern societyIts a movie about survival And its a war movie without battle scenes I would urge you to watch it,10
1337,tt0031381,Im sorry I generally dont like this film Expansive epic picturesque an achievement for its time  OK A compelling story about the devastation hardship suffering and brutality of the Civil War and the courage and resilience of its survivors  OK but credit the novel for all thatA key problem is the heroine Scarlett OHara who remains insufferably selfish and inhumane throughout this long movie Are we supposed to admire her? I cannot Another problem is that the film drags in many places Too much screen time is focused on men professing love for Scarlett and Scarlett expressing her hopeless adoration for Ashley Gosh move on with it! Even for its time I cant see how its flaws failed to overcome its grandeur,6
1338,tt0031381,I first saw Gone with the Wind in its initial commercial TV broadcast in  I have since seen the film numerous times via a succession of home video media videotape laserdisc and DVD Yet seeing the film once more on bluray and a large widescreen high def monitor is like seeing it completely anew The sweeping cinematography of this classic epic film has never before been delivered to home audiences in such stunning power and detail The achingly romantic score has never sounded better whether heard in original mono or reconstructed stereo Rhett Butler Clark Gable has never looked more rakishly handsome nor Scarlett OHara Vivien Leigh more alluringly sensual In short for anyone not having seen Gone with the Wind in glorious bigscreen Technicolor almost all film viewers under the age of  the recent bluray release is a mustsee revelationBeyond the compelling audiovisual experience Gone with the Wind thankfully retains its fascination as a central piece of American popular culture  a work of art complex and rich enough not only to bear up under multiple viewings but to reveal like great literature different aspects of its meaning depending on the cultural and personal variables that a viewer brings to the experience There were certainly a great number of impressions in my recent viewing that I dont remember having in quite the same way   or even  years agoFor one thing characters and character relationships impacted me much differently than in the past Scarletts multiple marriages and affairs – even the protracted love/hate odyssey with Rhett – seemed less interesting now than the strength of character that enables her physical survival and success as a business woman In many ways Scarlett is clearly not an ante and postbellum Southern belle but a woman of the s newly emerging from a patriarchal culture and acquiring a social role and status equivalent to a malesAs with other s films that touch upon the redefinition of female roles Scarletts acquisition of masculine power is greeted with ambivalence or downright hostility Even Rhett who is generally bemused by and attracted to Scarletts unbridled selfinterested power grabs eventually tries to tame and dominate Scarlett via marriage On one occasion he tries to persuade her to give up the lumber mill and become a more devoted mother to Bonnie Blue On another he compares the heartless Scarlett unfavorably to Belle Watling another hardheaded businesswoman but one whose ancient profession is considerably less threatening Ultimately Rhett attempts to assert his masculine power by an act of sexual aggression for which he would today be subject to domestic rape charges Amazingly given the era in which the film was made nothing works for long Scarlett is indomitable and irrepressible Unlike other s heroines Scarlett is NEVER reduced to a subordinate role In the end Tara and the screen are hers and hers aloneAnother thing that struck me in my latest viewing of Gone with the Wind was how much its creators particularly David O Selznick strove to temper the racist content of the story materials Of course they were unsuccessful from todays perspective but when the film is compared to Birth of a Nation the original film epic of the Souths secession and destruction one can clearly see its progressive designs First of all glorification of the Souths rebellion is tempered from the outset by the dissenting voices of such otherwise dissimilar characters as Rhett and Ashley both of whom foresee that the South has written its own ticket to destruction by entering into a war it cannot possibly win and for an historically dubious cause Notably the two central male characters view slavery askance Rhett is never a slaveholding gentleman And Ashley who is the scion of slaveholders reveals plans to free the Wilkes slaves upon the death of his father Moreover the slaves on the Tara plantation while still subject to stereotypical treatment are far more prominent and rounded as characters than in any previous American film intended principally for white audiences This is particularly true of sagelike Mammy of course but not only of herThe stark differences between the Mitchell/Selznick version of Civil War history and DW Griffiths can be seen most clearly in the postwar Reconstruction period In Gone with the Wind the really ugly stereotypes of empowered blacks are absent with the negative focus centering instead on white carpetbaggers Even the threats to Scarletts Southern Womanhood come not from renegade blacks but first from a white Northern deserter and later from white scalawags in Shantytown a locale that Scarlett intrepidly if foolishly ventures through From this latter threat she is pointedly rescued not by chivalrous whites but by her former slave Sam who beats off the wouldbe rapists and drives Scarlett safely home What a far cry this is from Birth of a Nation where Little Sister throws herself from a cliff rather than be raped by a former slave who has stalked her through perilous woodsAbove all Gone with the Wind deliberately avoids all mention of the Ku Klux Klan the terminally embarrassing heroes of Birth of a Nation The only scene that comes close to a Klan allusion occurs following the attempted assault on Scarlett when Ashley Dr Meade and thenhusband Mr Kennedy set about clandestinely to clean out the scalawags Yet even then their targets are not primarily black nor do the avengers don robes The audience is not even permitted to witness the attack – only Ashleys wounds from itIf Americans in the st century can still respond to Gone With the Wind  and clearly they can  it is not only because of its grand pictorial displays and epic action but because in terms of gender and race this classic of Hollywoods  peak year looks forward to a modern tomorrow as much as if not more than it laments a tragically flawed American past,9
1339,tt0031381,I was dating at the time this came out in a small theater on Hollywood blvd for a short run Me and my girlfriend decided to see a movie and chose this one not knowing anything about it We sat in the balcony and was immediately captured by the music characters storyline and each other as we watched what we thought was a memorable night out together Unknown to me when part one ended I thought the movie was over and remarked boy that was good but I wonder what happened after that We got up to go and found out it was only intermission I cannot describe the feelings of joy knowing there was more We were not disappointed either When it ended I felt totally satisfied and changed forever more A great movie with my future wife locked into each other for our lifetime Since then I have seen this movie so many times never tiring of it I bought the collectors sets vhs and finally the DVD Just finished watching it again loving every moment until the end Will I see it again? Why not after all tomorrow is another dayGood movie to eat with while watching,10
1340,tt0031381,I love this film I have seen it a handful of times and even though I am always a little frustrated by the stubborn pride of the two main characters I can never dislike it True Scarlet OHara is a foolish woman who believes she is madly in love with someone elses husband but she is just as bad as the proud Rhett Butler who loves her through it all Their problem is admitting their true feelings deep down and in this small selfish act is where we find the heart of the story and its timelessness We all love that great timeless love story despite its tragic ending and Scarlets tenacity for surviving and keeping her family alive even if it did involve tricks and schemes on her part Despite all this the film managed to capture the heart of Americans everywhere and even those hearts of the generations that followed That is the true power of this film Aside from being able to enchant its audiences Gone With The Wind was truly a groundbreaking film in American Cinema It was one of the first major films that came out in vividly welldone color not only that but the photography was phenomenal also Much more can be said about this film but for now all I will say is this Fantastic film worth the  hours,10
1341,tt0031381,I waited  year before even considering watching Gone With The Wind Four plus hours long? ? It was as old as my Dad But finally in a desire to see all these classic movies I sat down to watch itsince then and before writing this review I have now seen it three times Gone With The Wind is quite simply breath taking It is brilliant and captivating and perhaps one of the greatest epics you will ever lay eyes on Some people consider Gone With The Wind to be the greatest film ever made and its pretty easy to see why Especially if you factor in the time period this was made the special effects the sheer grandeur of it is impressive NOW let alone  years ago The raging war the fields being worked the attacks being carried out the people evacuating and the beauty and horror of the south during the civil war Add onto that this incredible unmatched chemistry between the romantic leads and youve got one incredible epic that defined epic before it even existedVivien Leigh is Scarlett OHara One of the most influential and recognizable characters in movie historyprobably top  Leighs Scarlett will remain in your memory forever Her character goes through so many changes and at times you literally despise hershes whiny and needy and mousy and then in the next breath you see this incredible strength and wisdom and this ability to make her such a hero Shes a strong female lead and her performance is amazing Scarlett OHara is one of the greatest characters in movie history Clark Gable as the irrepressible Captain Rhett Butler At first I thought Gables performance lacked depth I thought he came across as a movie star there to show off his stuff but then as the film progressed I began to see what Captain Butler was all about Rhett Butler had this air of overconfidence a macho party man with nothing holding him down including political ties His reputation as a drunkard and a rich bachelor suited him fine Then Scarlett comes into his life and he falls hopelessly in love with the most unlikely girl that plagues him for the years and years Gable is a master and looks incredible on screen and shows why men of his era were leading men the likes of which weve never known He definitely deserved his Oscar Nomination for the role The supporting cast is so huge I could go into detail on every single one of them They all do an incredible job including the first African American actor to be nominated for an Academy Award Hattie McDaniel who is just wonderful as Mammy their beloved house servant Leslie Howard as Scarletts love interest for years and years Ashley Wilkes Olivia de Havilland was one of my favorite supporting roles as the loving and kind Melanie Wilkes who marries Ashley away from Scarlett She was terrific in her role one of the best characters in the film Harry Davenport Thomas Mitchell Barbara ONeil Butterfly McQueenso so so many other terrific performances in this film Also watch for uncredited and small roles by future stars George Reeves Superman and Richard Farnsworth The Straight Story/Anne of Green Gables For years I havent been a fan of old classics Just now am I getting around to watching them but if youre the same way put that aside and see Gone With The Wind Its LONG there is no doubt about it but its utter brilliance story action romance and just everything about it will keep you absolutely riveted I now completely understand why people consider this one of the greatest films ever made if not THEE greatest I dont know if I can say that exactly because I have my own list of favorites for different reasons but I will say Gone With The Wind is perhaps the exact definition of a classic and worthwhile from beginning to end One of the greatest films I have ever seen and I will be sure to add this to the list of movies I watch again and again /,10
1342,tt0031381,Over the weekend I was given the opportunity to see Gone With The Wind in theaters with my parents for its th anniversary Its kind of embarrassing to me that I a selfprofessed lover and at this point addict of cinema hadnt yet seen a movie that is universally considered one of if not THE best American movie ever made Part of me had always been turned off by its  hour runtime as I am in college and dont often have the time to sit down and watch a movie in a single hour sitting But another part of me had shied away from Gone due to all the blatant racism in it that I had been warned of I had wasted my time watching DW Griffiths epic The Birth of a Nation and did not want to sit through another slog of a film that is great technically but ruined by its subtext So when I sat down in the theater I was hesitant but excited And yes Gone With The Wind is undoubtedly racist but it is also so much more and the fact that it can be both great while having all of its apparent flaws is the very reason why it is undoubtedly a classic,10
1343,tt0031679,James Stewart and Frank Capra  One neednt know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film  Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a naïve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft  Jefferson Smith James Stewart is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies  He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor Edward Arnold millions  When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a childrens camp  When he tries to stop the project Taylors political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft  This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth outThis film is wonderful in so many ways  The story is a classic struggle between good and evil  In typical Capra style the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys  If there is one clear message in Capras films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope  He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds  I was dismayed to see a comment obviously from a young viewer of this film that said that the characters werent realistic because no one used profanity  This is a sad testimonial to our culture when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule Stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington with its monuments and history  The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that dont compromise their principles to hold on to power  Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the partJean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smiths noble homespun philosophies  Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency  He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiableThis film is a national treasure  It is in my top  list of all time  The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today  A /,10
1344,tt0031679,Now I must admit that this is one of my top five favorite films There is a warmth idealism and kinda simple feeling of hope that makes one believe that things will work out in the end Capra knew exactly what he wanted and it shines Jimmy Stewart in the role of his life makes us believe what we know is almost impossible in todays crass worldClaude Rains is incredible as Senator Smiths evil mentor Jean Arthur as his confidant plays the part so wellthat we just want her to save the dayThe final scene where the filibuster is taking place is among the greatest ever madeBUT THE PROOF YOU ASK?In the early s I showed this film over three days to a group of  year old inner city teenagers I taught Political Science in a very difficult school in Chicago It was a new class and not all of the best students took itI decided to show this film at the end of the year just to see how long I could keep the students attention I didnt expect much Fifteen is a very tough age to keep any kind of attention span and it was at the end of the day   pm which made things worse As the film began there was rustling in the seats boredom that famous oh what a waste of time lookMind you this is  year old film about a white Senator in those old days and being shown to a totally AfroAmerican crowd of  year olds late in the day over a three day period which meant the students would have to wait till the next day to see what was going on By the end of the third day Capra had worked his magic and the entire class was spellbound by this film They were there till the very end and you could see how much they enjoyed seeing a film that they wouldnt have looked at in a thousand yearsComments were wonderful Any film that could accomplish this more than  years after its conception to a crowd that no one would believe would have any interest in deserves to be truly called a great film,10
1345,tt0031679,The media and those in Washington DC cringed in  when Frank Capra Oscarnominated for directing come out with Mr Smith Goes to Washington Capra fresh off amazing successes like Lady for a Day It Happened One Night Mr Deeds Goes to Town Lost Horizon and You Cant Take It With You used his power to slap some bigwigs in the face with a powerful mediumthe motion picture The result was an immediate backlash by publications and politicians but cheers from critics and the audience As with society the critics and the masses won out as the movie is a masterpiece in every way A US Senate vacancy leads to a dilemma Who should be put in office? Everyone believes the apparently naive and gullible James Stewart Oscarnominated is the logical choice because he will be easy to manipulate and he wont rock the boat Stewart the leader of the Boy Rangers a local camp association for youngsters gets blindsided by many highranking officials who have alterior motives Oscar nominees Harry Carey and Claude Rains in particular when his idea for a national boys camp goes by the wayside Thus the only thing left for Stewart is to beat those in charge by beating them at their own gamecreating a filibuster a neverending governmental argument for his cause Stewart is solid as always here and the supporters love interest/reporter Jean Arthur and drunk newspaper man Thomas Mitchell included with the aforementioned players are all terrific throughout The Oscarwinning screenplay is deceptively intelligent and Capra just had the uncanny ability to mix comedy drama and interpersonal characterizations together to make consistently wonderful American film experiences  stars out of ,0
1346,tt0031679,Since the beginning of the art form movies have generally fallen into two categories the realistic and the fantastic fantasybased  There are some that point out that the films of Frank Capra unduly fall into the latter that they are completely farfetched and fastened in their own time and even invented a pejorative term Capraesque to describe any noncynical heartwarming picture that has a message  His great films like It Happened One Night Its a Wonderful Life and of course Mr Smith Goes to Washington however are not fixed in a single era but all eras the truest definition of a classic  And considering it was released among true powerhouses in  a year as important to movies as  was to baseball its ideals story and general excellence shine as bright today as it did over  years agoA Senator from an unnamed middle America state dies and a new one must be appointed by Governor Hubert Hopper a puppet whose strings are held by newspaper magnate Jim Taylor  They need to find one that would be easily controlled by the nowsenior Senator Joseph Paine played brilliantly by Claude Rains so a bill allowing a building of a dam near land by the Willett Creek owned by Taylor can pass in the Senate  After his initial choice is rejected by Taylor and Taylors handpicked man is shot down by the public the governor chooses Jefferson Smith played to perfection by James Stewart a boy scout leader and local hero who is both wholly idealistic in his patriotism for America but naive and blind to the actual process  After he gets embarrassed by the local print media Mr Smith begins to learn the harsh realities of DC  Paine Smiths boyhood hero takes him under his wing and suggests that Smith try to create a bill Smith agrees and with his assistant Clarissa Saunders played by Jean Arthur they create a bill to create a campground for boys from all over the country to learn about each other and the civic process much to the initial dissuasion by Saunders  Smith then wants to choose a site near the Willett Creek the same site where the dam is to be built and when his superiors and true stringpullers find that out major complications ensueAlthough the basic premise is David vs Goliath the story is wholly originally and was probably one of the earliest pictures to suggest the government as corrupt  The characters are played excellently by all principal actors with Mr Smith you root for wholeheartedly Mr Taylor you root against for his sheer arrogance and greed and Mr Paine who you pity as you see a man who lost his initial zest to serve the public and is now a jaded shell of his former self  A great performance was given by Harry Carey Sr who plays the Vice President/President of the Senate for comic relief  The lines where completely believable and the parts of Smiths final filibuster that were shown give the most impact  There is a beautifully shot scene with images of the monuments and sights of Washington with several national anthems synchronized as the score  The climax is as tensionpacked as drama can get and while the ending may seem rather sudden and everything isnt completely or neatly resolved it works perfectly and ends the movie on a happy noteObviously few if any people elected to public office has the moral character conviction and general good heartedness of Jefferson Smith and I doubt whether the government would be better if it was  The movie showed an ideal a supposed lost cause of truth in government  And although it is next to impossible for Capra and the eternal good guy Jimmy Stewart to ever fully change the world of politics with just a motion picture at least it shows that maybe once in a great while being the good guy has its definite rewards  If using the same analogy of the  baseball season The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind were the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa of  moviemaking then this would be like Cal Ripken voluntarily ending his Iron Man Streak something done with full class and the highest respect in mind and that elevates an ideal of being the good guy and sticking to your dedication brings the greatest of riches  This picture is flawless in all respects and a true classic with thoughtprovoking ideas wit a little bit of platonic romance and an excellent cinematography and score and deserves the rank as a  out of   And in giving this rating either Im damn right or Im crazy,10
1347,tt0031679,Frank Capra and James Stewart were nearly unsurpassed at the task of taking the kind of story that is optimistic but that borders on being trite and making it into a satisfying worthwhile movie In Mr Smith Goes To Washington they accomplish this with a little help from Jean Arthur Claude Rains and Edward Arnold Its not quite on the level of Its a Wonderful Life but it is as good as almost anything else of its kindStewarts performance is important right from the beginning  hardly anyone else could have been believable as the earnest unknown who suddenly becomes an important political figure Even his wideeyed appreciation for what he sees in Washington comes across believably As the story gets more complicated and his character is developed further Stewart is even betterThe secondary characters are also important because the story itself is a rather stylized though still worthwhile statement about politics The characters are more believable than are many of the plot developments Rains contributes a lot as Stewarts troubled colleague and Jean Arthur is a natural for this kind of role Arnold plays his devious character well Capra holds it all together with his craftsmanship keeping the story on track and getting the most out of the situation,0
1348,tt0031679,It was a lot of fun watching Mr Smith Goes to Washington in a class where the professor noted how this was the sort of film that was of historical importance while not taking itself too seriously And I think thats the way Frank Capra wanted it in a sense Perhaps in the time of  America this film was seen as being of merit to the American Governments due though according to the trivia it was denounced at showing corruption and even banned for showing how democracy works But the director is also wanting to make an entertaining movie of the kind of Hollywood appeal that brings to years olds in attendance What had me interested throughout particularly in that climactic rousing twentyminute sequence in the Senate with Jimmy Stewarts constant unfaltering filibuster is how it really is a patriotic kind of bravura to be shown on the screen Here is how it SHOULD be done to an extreme perhaps in getting things done in government But at the same time Capra keeps it entirely watchable with that group of kids up on the balcony keeping the audience laughing and smiling all the way through the great lines that Stewart says Great principles dont get lost once they come to light Theyre right here; you just have to see them again! This is a kind of talent that Im sure few other filmmakers at the time or even after could have pulled offThe rest of the film isnt just Stewarts struggle to be heard as a young newintown senator Its also a witty more often than not true look of how government tends to really work as opposed to how it should Basically the core of the story is the fishoutofwater type where Stewarts Jefferson Smith one of his better Hollywood performances leader of the Boy Rangers is called to be the senator of his state He has a childhood hero in town in the form of a senior senator Claude Rains terrific as always And theres even a woman Jean Arthur in the mix thats growing an interest in him at first dubious But despite the corruption that is almost thrust upon smith by Jim Taylor Edward Arnold as skilled a character actor as could be asked for Smith fights it all the way to his final filibuster which includes a reading from the Constitution inandout cheers from the Boy Rangers and general guffaws from the other senators In other words its really much in that pure spirit of Frank Capra that Mr Smith is working in and even at its cheesiest and sometimes mostdated moments its a very successful picture for what it wants to do Its really an equalopportunity kind of film about people in politics that should be able decades later to appeal to both the hopeful and the cynical and it works as good as it does a comedy as it does a piece to show in history of film or American government course,10
1349,tt0031679,Mr Smith Goes to Washington is a wonderful film about a man Jeff Smith James Stewart who believes that children are the future and should be able to enjoy the outdoors while taking in knowledge of their great Country When a senator dies in Smiths state the governor is forced into an awkward position of electing the new senator While the governor is sitting down to dinner his young children propose the idea of Jeff Smith who is head of the Boy Rangers and prints a weekly newspaper for the local children Mr Smith is elected into office in the funniest way a coin toss ,10
1350,tt0031679,Mr Smith is as good as its legend Sometimes Im disappointed when a universally acclaimed movie isnt as enjoyable as I thought it would be But here that is not the case James Stewart is deservedly remembered most for this role Thats saying a lot given his impressive body of work This is also Frank Capras signature film along with Mr Deeds The idealism of Jefferson Smith might feel a bit anachronisitc today but and I know this is a cliché the world could use more people with his values The supporting cast is also spot on Jean Arthur plays the same type as she did in Mr Deeds and Claude Rains is terrific as the mentor who betrays Smith Strongly recommended /,9
1351,tt0031679,Frank Capras knack for getting the best out of JAMES STEWART and JEAN ARTHUR is demonstrated here with both stars giving superb performances Ironically Stewart would not win the Oscar for this role but was awarded one the following year for a lesser role in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY,0
1352,tt0031679,In Mr Smith Goes to Washington a US senator suddenly passes away and Mr Smith is tapped to fill the position Unbeknownst to the honest decent Smith he is intended merely to be a puppet of the powerful forces that already control the states governor and its other Congressmen Smith collides headon with these forces and must fight to save himself and his values from destruction in the public arenaMr Smith directed by Frank Capra is not meant to be very realistic The basic plot and characters of Mr Smith are borderline ridiculous Smith goes beyond naive to the point of appearing ignorant and lacking in common sense at times He seems to have the civics education of a ndgrader Everything in the movie is exaggerated to the extremesCapras DC is likewise a caricature The US Senate is a united front of entrenched cronyism They move as one nonpartisan mass always supporting each other in their mutual corruption The media is easily herded into line an interpretation that probably strikes closer to truth although that system today has been undermined by the InternetStill if the true Washington is not quite as fraudulent as Copras version theres no doubt that it is probably perceived that way by many Americans today The film touches upon real issues that affect modern politics Its amazing how relevant certain lines and scenes remain after all these years perhaps more so todayWhat did bug me about the film was its shamelessly idealistic view of smalltown American heroes like Mr Smith Like a Bruckenheimer movie where Billy boy and Jim Bob from the ranch save the planet Mr Smith sometimes comes off as a selfcongratulatory pat on the back to the common man It rails against the elitism and special interest of Washington a popular sentiment todayThis might not bother me so much except that this country is just coming off an extended experiment of putting a commoner in a government seat of critical importance and things didnt turn out so hot As nasty cold and dirty as it may seem to place a compromising politician into DC that may be preferable to putting an oh shucks well golly gee I dunno kinda guy into a position of major responsibilityThis country has a low tolerance for corruption It has an even lower tolerance of incompetence,7
1353,tt0031679,`Mr Smith Goes to Washington is not as well known of a movie as it should be  It is a very good movie that is very interesting and a very good way to learn how some things involving the Senate work  This reviewer absolutely loved this movie and wishes she could run out and buy it right now   It definitely grabs the audiences attention and keeps it there  While watching this movie this reviewer was laughing smiling getting really really angry learning and even getting a little tearyeyed  How can a movie that brings out all those different emotions in someone not be great or even spectacular!  `Mr Smith Goes to Washington is definitely one of the best movies ever made despite the fact that it is mostly about politics! Its still interesting!While watching this movie the audience might be thinking that the acting isnt half bad and is actually quite realistic  They would be right too! All of the acting is really very good and it draws the audience in and keeps them in  This movie was so close to not having one single cheesy line or unbelievable acting job that its really a shame that it did  At the very end of the movie Saunders played by                  stands up from her seat in the balcony and yells `Stop Jeff! Stop! and then falls to the floor  The line and the way       says it is very very cheesy and something the audience might find themselves laughing at  That line is just about the only time in the entire movie where the acting was lacking  James Stewart was of course phenomenal  He is a very good actor and one that should be remembered for a very long time  Hes awesome!The only other not so great thing about `Mr Smith Goes to Washington is the ending  Its a happy ending but well it just ends  Its an abrupt ending  It ends so abruptly that the audience isnt even expecting it to end when it does  It has one of those endings where the audience knows a bunch of things that will be happening they just arent shown happening This reviewer doesnt really care for those kind it is much better when you get to see the things carried out  Although the ending could have been better `Mr Smith Goes to Washington is still an awesome movie and the ending doesnt take away from that at all!This movie is so great that every person in the world should be able to see it because it is definitely worth the time it takes to see it,10
1354,tt0031679,From time to time a movie comes along that holds up so well that it actually gets BETTER with age Mr Smith Goes To Washington is EXACTLY that type of movieFor a basic plot summary this movie tells the story of Jefferson Smith Jimmy Stewart a sort of wideeyed rube who only gets promoted to US Senator because of the political machine of Senator Joseph Payne Claude Rains whom the young Smith adores Once in Washington however Smith gets a rude awakening as to the real politics of DC With the help of a female aide named Saunders Jean Arthur Smith must decide whether to fall in line or fight the deep rooted corruption in the Capitol domeThis movie remains an alltime classic for two primary reasons It strikes such a simple emotional chord in all of us Even though deep down we know that corruption runs rampant in even the highest levels of government we like to cling to the ideals that the nation was founded on Well that is exactly the journey that Stewarts Smith viscerally takes us on We want him to succeed so badly because we all feel as if that is what WE would do in a similar situation I know Ill probably get a few downvotes for this statement alone but I believe that our government is as corrupt now as it has ever been Thus while watching Stewarts impassioned pleas for honesty and common sense my heart ached for the United States of America So not only does Mr Smith stand the test of time but it actually transcends itBasically this movie does to politics what fellow Frank Capra film Its A Wonderful Life does to Christmas If it were up to me this movie would be shown in every American Government high school classroom and on television sometime the week before every major political election It is THAT important in the message that it espouses,10
1355,tt0031679,Besides a brilliantly written story and brilliant acting by James Stewart there is one element of this movie that cant be overlooked Jean Arthurs actingWith her voice and facial expressions she pulls you through the storyline The movie may be about Mr Smith Stewart but much of it is seen through Saunders Arthurs eyes  When she falls in love with Smith we cant help but do it tooThis is Capras opus and contains not one but two of the best acting performances Ive ever seen,0
1356,tt0031679,Patriotic stirring uplifting absolutely mesmerizing Here are just a few words that can be used to describe Frank Capras brilliant  film Mr Smith Goes to Washington Bringing together a stellar cast of both fresh and seasoned actors Capra manages to reach into each of our chests and wrench almost painfully at our heartstringsJefferson Smith James Stewart Its A Wonderful Life is a young enthusiastic patriot who resides in an unnamed American state but is known throughout it most especially by the young boys of the region as an unsung hero Head of the Boy Rangers Smith has a love of his country and of nature once quenching a potentially devastating forest fire singlehandedly After the unexpected death of a current Senator Governor Hubert Hopper Guy Kibbee is forced to choose a replacement Whilst his corrupt political boss Jim Taylor Edward Arnold urges him to appoint a handpicked stooge Hopper surprisingly decides to follow the confident advice of his own children awarding the job to SmithSmith arrives in Washington excited and idealistic no doubt modestly considering himself to be unsuitable for such a prestigious position He is proud to accompany the other current state Senator Joseph Harrison Paine Claude Rains Notorious a highlyesteemed man who was once great friends with Smiths father Unbeknownst to Smith however Paine had long ago abandoned his political ideals seduced by the promise of power and political longevity to make certain compromises Whilst Smith works tirelessly to submit a bill regarding the creation of a national boys camp at Willet Creek which he hopes will teach a new generation the value of freedom and liberty the devious Paine schemes to dam that same locality an act that will serve nobody but the powerhungry Jim Taylor When Paines cynical secretary Clarissa Saunders Jean Arthur informs Smith of these plans he determinedly attempts to speak his mind only to be quashed by the almighty Taylor MachineFrank Capra who had previously supplied Columbia Pictures Corporation with two Academy Award Best Picture winners It Happened One Night  and You Cant Take It With You  once again proved his undeniable genius something he would continue to do throughout his filmmaking career One oftencited example involves the romanticallyawkward Smiths second encounter with Paines beautiful daughter Susan Astrid Allwyn Rather than focusing on faces as would be the typical style for such a scene Capra keeps the camera firmly on Smiths hat as he restlessly shuffles it between his fingers frequently dropping it to the floor and stooping to reclaim it This shot tells us more about Smith than any facial closeup ever could!Finally James Stewart is unquestionably brilliant as the young idealistic Smith in one of his first critically recognised roles The look of absolute awe and wonderment on his face upon first witnessing the Capitol Dome appears truly genuine despite the fact that Stewart was merely acting against a projection For his highly memorable filibuster speech at the climax of the film Stewart dried out his throat with bicarbonate of soda to make himself sound hoarse an act that could potentially have destroyed his later ability to speak As we witness Jefferson Smith ragged and exhausted determinedly continuing to shout hoarsely at the Senate members we immediately understand that his voice is reaching much much further He is not just shouting at the Senate but he is shouting at the people; he is shouting at his country; he is shouting at us And we are right there alongside him quietly urging him along,9
1357,tt0031679,I admit that I just saw this movie very recently and approached it as a typical teenager would in this day and age But I forgot how much I love Jimmy Stewart in Its a Wonderful Life one of my all time favorites and how much I love Frank Capra Well obviously I ended up falling in love with this movie too Of course its not a typical movie like wed see in theaters today Im not sure why people rate it based on that Old movies should be treated with more respect! They didnt have the technology that we did now and the most advance things they could do were corny montages  Really I found a lot of things funny in this movie that shouldnt have been but I tend to laugh more than anything; life is just better that way The boys in the entire movie were hilarious They were justso strange And for some reason it was okay for angry politicians to ram their huge truck into the boys car And it was okay for Jimmyboy to run around the streets punching people But in the end I believe those parts made the movie more enjoyable!The music the acting the directingit was all top notch in my opinion Well the music was a bit too patriotic at times but that was very appropriate Jean Arthur was very cute and played her role quite well And for some reason I fell in love with Claude Rains voicewhich means I fell in love with his character I had to convince myself that there was some good in him and I was right The story was just fine a lot better than a lot of movies around today! oy! We went over the corninessand the plot may have been a bit predictable but I really wanted it to end well Good needs to defeat evil in the end And sure the ending may seem a bit abrupt but what can they say after that? All is well! A very good movie Id recommend it to ANYONEyou might just be surprised hey can you believe it? I really hate history and I enjoyed this movie!,0
1358,tt0031679,If I could choose one movie more than any other which was not only brilliant but highly significant it would be this one We live an an age when cynicism about politics is rife when people who get involved to change things for the better are more often than not dismissed as naive; this is a film which everyone who is cynical towards politics should see It doesnt hide the fact that there is corruption in politics but it does say quite clearly that there is a point and a value to standing up to itAs movie quotes go Jean Arthurs words to Jeff Smith deserve to be remembered Your friend Mr Lincoln had his Taylors and Paines So did every other man whoever tried to lift his thought up off the ground Odds against em didnt stop those men They were fools that way All the good that ever came into this world came from fools with faith like that This is a movie which can teach a very valuable lesson particularly those who despair of modern politics There is a way forward,10
1359,tt0031679,What a wonderful film What an exaggerated corny fantastic beautifully acted exciting wonderful filmMr Smith Goes to Washington is a classic for good reason It reinforces qualities that many of us have lost along the way idealism strong unshakable belief never quitting honesty and commitment Today patriotism and American values have taken on another connotation They have become the property of the right wing But there isnt anything wrong with the kind of patriotism and American values expressed by Jefferson Smith which are different from what is being expressed todayIs anyone today as idealistic as Mr Smith was when he first came to Washington? Can one really win against a powerful force like the Taylor machine? As one who was involved in a legal case where the other side had all the clout and all the money I sadly have to answer that I dont think so In the real world as Court TV has taught us things dont work that way Is anyone as corrupt as Senator Paine and Jim Taylor? Sadly Id have to say probably Would they ruin anyone who got in their way? Yes Have they? DefinitelyMr Smith Goes to Washington is a fantasy but its a fantasy that uplifts us and reminds us of what we could be and like Jean Arthur says in the film maybe being jaded isnt such a good idea all the timeJames Stewart had the role of a lifetime and he was perfect Homespun intelligent boyishly goodlooking his career and tremendous popularity even today speak for themselves His filibuster scenes are incredible passionate and strong We were lucky we had him as long as we did There will never be another Jean Arthur was fabulous in her role as a streetwise assistant who finds something to believe in Claude Rains as the unlikable weak Senator Paine gives a powerful performance The bad guys  and Capra always makes sure theyre real bad  were all great As for Harry Carey the sympathetic speaker you want to hug him A fantastic jobFrank Capra knew how to make movies The pace is swift the story strong and the scenes tense and exciting One gets caught up in the world he fashions A shame it isnt real,10
1360,tt0031679,Frank Capras fans give Capra high marks for his film making He was a great Director But Capras detractors said he was known for his corn rather than art If truth is art then Capra fails not to entertain but as a truth teller Capra is one of the first message directors In this movie he goes against the Washington establishment political hacks and powers behind the throne The sad fact is that nothing has changed because human nature has not changed Capra creates the Character of Jefferson Smith played by Jimmy Stewart in an great performance The supporting cast performs as well under the direction of Capra Whether Capra or the writers are to blame is not known but the Smith character is a caricature of a real person And because he is not real and the story is not reality If this movie was considered a comedy so be it but critics have had  plus years to consider this movie as a significant comment on good versus evil Stewarts character is chosen by a shallow Governor to fill a US Senate seat and his choice is not the best candidate for the job Nothing unbelievable in that  but Smiths character is stretched beyond belief To become a US Senator you must be at least  years old Smith is introduced as someone with the maturity of a  year old With no wife no girl friend; he acts like a  year old when introduced to mature women Taking a tour of Washington leaving his homing pigeons to the care of others is also the behavior of an adolescent Capra wants us to believe that adolescence is synonymous with honesty It is not Nor was his striking journalists who portrayed him as a dopeSomehow this idealistic character takes on the corruption of the world in the form of a junior Senator and conquers all And discovers love and gets the girl in the end If you like vintage syrup this movie is right for you Just remember its just a movie and in real life the bad guys usually win,5
1361,tt0031679,James Stewart was simply magnificent in this memorable classic of a dedicated young politician who is appointed to the senate following the death of his states senator He wants to do what is best for his constituents He soon learns that in Washington this is not to be the case Corruption patronage et al are alive and well and functioningEdward Arnold in a supporting role is fabulous as the old style political boss The Stewart character represents what we need as leaders to run this great nation of ours Some real scene stealing is done by Claude Rains as the other states senator who has become corrupt His temperament is perfect for the part His seething by guilt and his denunciation of his fellow senator shows depth in acting His outburst at the end of the film is totally memorable He claims that he has compromised to get what he wants How far from the truth this really is! Jean Arthur as the secretary in the know is truly fabulous as well Newspapers can learn from this film They should Censorship still exists in Remember that great filibuster scene? Stewart acted his heart out Though he lost the coveted Oscar here the Academy rewarded him the following year for the comedy The Philadelphia StoryThis film should be a definite prerequisite for students in political science classes,10
1362,tt0031679,The theme of one man being able to combat the ways of a longestablished system is not a new one In fact man versus machine is one of the oldest forms of conflict in cinema but this is a different kind of machine this Taylor Machine When a young naive and idealistic man by the name of Jefferson Smith James Stewart is placed as a pawn in the United States Senate he is honored and humbled by the job set out before him He sees it as an opportunity to provide a service for his country and even more so his people In Jefferson Smith we see everything that is good and wholesome in America One man who wishes for nothing more than an improvement upon a country that he already cherishes He intends to do everything he can to fulfill his duty as a newly appointed Senator However the people that put him there were not nearly as patriotic in their intentions Jim Taylor Edward Arnold and Senator Joseph Harrison Paine Claude Rains have conspired to put Smith in office in hopes that he will simply sit there and keep quiet while they pass a bill that will profit Taylor Smiths dream of building a national boys camp is shattered by Taylors scheme to build a dam in the same area The powerful Jim Taylor is forced to pull some strings in order to discredit the young senator so that his dam can be built The Taylor Machine frames Smith accusing him of fraud Shamed Smith is ready to leave Washington behind when his assistant Clarissa Saunders Jean Arthur inspires him to fight for his ideals just as his forefathers had Smith returns to congress armed with a new strategy to accomplish his goalJames Stewart gives one of his finest performances as Jefferson Smith the young passionately patriotic Senator confronting corruption in the government he holds so dear Jean Arthurs performance as Clarissa Saunders is strong while Claude Rains is forced to counter Stewarts inspired intensity a feat that I feel he accomplishes The filibuster scene is one of the highlights of the film and one of the more memorable sequences in American cinema Mr Smith Goes to Washington is a wonderful movie not just because of James Stewarts relentless performance but because it has quite a bit to say It is a statement declaring that ideals are stronger than the pages they are printed on and that it is our ideals and the spirit through which we see them realized that allows one man to topple the machine,9

1365,tt0031679,Well this is like any other political film oozing patriotism where the small guy gets the big guy The underdog wins All American Better yet it is Frank Capra with James Stewart Can we get any more cliché? Oh wait The main character is a Jefferson Smith Bribery corruption conspiracy lies and deceit It is all here Shady deals ulterior motives In other words politics In case it was not already obvious I am not very political But guess what? In all the above ways yes this is like all those other films But it the most important ways it is not What makes it different? In one word Stewart Sure the clever writing the directing the supporting cast are all assets to the film But he makes this film His characters name is in the title after all Through his heartfelt performance as Jefferson Smith the audience is inspired; even the most cynical of us might find ourselves beginning to really like this country appreciate what we have today that our ancestors did not and maybe even believe that we can make a difference by getting involved in politics His naiveté is practically excruciating at times His first glance at the White House can be compared to a little kid in a candy store His first evening exploring all the monuments along and around the National Mall is shown in montage form with patriotic backgrounds music Cheesy yes But somehow it was not as bad as it sounds As he an everyday man tries to acclimate himself in the world of politics each blunder brings new laughs His awkwardness in palpable and his character lovable Eventually of course he must learn the truth that it does not really exist in the government We all cheer for this everyday Smith as he tries to pave the way for all the little guys As far as high school or even grade school education goes this should be on a list of required viewings Along with School House Rocks classic How a Bill Becomes a Law of course I would have loved to learn about government the Senate bills and filibusters this way **** Spoilers **** Sadly it was the ending that brought the greatest disappointment It was extremely sudden and cheap After all that determination and rallying from Smith; after how far Paine was willing to go to condemn the man he supposedly felt was like a son to him after all his stubbornness to do the right thing he gives up and confesses everything on the Senate floor? Highly unlikely Even worse it cheapens all that Smith has done,7
1366,tt0031679,In Mr Smith Goes to Washington the legendary Jimmy Stewart plays the naive and somewhat gullible Mr Smith who is invited to become a senator by politicians corrupted by selfseeking businessmen who they perceive is rife for manipulation As such Stewarts character is a representation of Joe Public and how politicians manipulate the average voters views for political gain and moreover the corrupt businessmen and women who want to use their clout to pull strings which promotes their power and exacerbates their egos In order to emphasise this the accomplished director Frank Capra needs to contrive sympathy for the highly emotive issue of childrens welfare in the form of a boys camp here proposed by Senitor Smith When this is juxtaposed with hard and emotionally depleted business profit then there is no contest; the childrens welfare comes before corporate gain Arguably the methods by which corporate gain is achieved  in this case via corruption  is diluted by Capras emotive motive of using childrens welfare as a tool by which to direct opinion Nevertheless it is corporate gain via corrupt methods which tinges the philosophical ideology of existentialism To explain further existentialism is concerned with the idea of the self In other words placing the self at the centre of the universe As such the self becomes empowered In some circumstances this self has the potential to become a selfseeking force In this film that selfseeking force is the businessman who endeavours to gain via unethical means and corruption becomes associated with existentialism by default Hence existentialism becomes a negative force when juxtaposed with the utilitarian idea which champions that of the greatest good which is as Senitor Smith views written into American values which he naively permits to lead him without questioning the concept This value of the greatest good is the driving force of his cause for a boys campBut what will bring more benefit to society actually depends on how one interprets the ideas that are utilitarianism and existentialism which via opinion inadvertently contrive ideas of what is ethical and unethical which informs the voter of what is democratically acceptable To explain further the business venture is viewed in this film as unethical and thereby will be unacceptable to the voter Perhaps the narrative of the film should have balanced the viewers opinions by explaining that the business venture proposed has the potential to provide employment and spinoff enterprise for individuals As such these individuals would have the potential to prosper further and provide further employment and so on Meanwhile the boys camp would actually contrive a sense of good and thus instill into them another persons perception of what is ethical Is such paternalistic contrivance not just as corrupt in the sense of selfishness and self gain as any businessman or woman pulling a politicians strings? Further more Senitor Smiths paternalism would stifle the individuals freedom of thought Ironically such stifling of individual thought along with paternalism is what leaves voters such as that of Senitor Smith  remember here a representation of the average Joe Public  vulnerable like children open to manipulation by corrupted politiciansMeanwhile Capra utilises emotions which he purposefully exacerbates as a means of overcoming the otherwise monotonous bureaucracy at the heart of politics Without such affectation Capra would have lost his viewers to sheer boredom This is especially during the filibuster which Jimmy Stewart performs via the implementation of the sentimentality of an underdog fighting via the democratic process corruption within politics on behalf of his fellow citizens This affectation is juxtaposed by Capra in order to further achieve the portrayal of that of a man pleading for mercy after being assumed to be guilty For his convincing performance in this as the doggedly determined crusader of justice then Stewart deserves high praise Kudos also goes to the great Jean Auther whose implementation of her thespian skills serves to draw attention to her competent acting ability in the part of Clarrisser Saunders who coerces Senitor Smiths emotions The accomplished actor Claud Rains was also effective in his role as the politician corrupted by the unacceptable face of business which is as already suggested personified as that of selfishness Sailing so close to the political wind here Capra gives one potential reason for implementation and enforcement of the Hays Code as a justifiable force of stability within the United States film industry Retrospectively viewed with cynicism because it is perceived as constraining democracy within the art of film making the paternalistic Hays Code was originally written with ethical intention at the time of its implementation which was during a period of political instability throughout the world This instability was further exacerbated by the centralisation of the otherwise fringe politics of the far left and far right highlighted through the emergence of fascism and communism culminating in illiberal dictators in among other nations Italy Germany and the USSR Hence the films reference to dictators who ironically are used to promote the satirical point that proponents of illiberal politics are fascinated with Westernstyle democracy here undermined by Capras portrayal of it as an essentially corrupt force The time of the films production means that there is allot of political incorrectness An example includes the idea that boys as opposed to girls are the backbone of a nation But where would have Mr Smith been without Clarissa Sauners? Business is also highlighted as white overtly heterosexual male middle age and middle class But the question is have things changed for the better in a world of political correctness? Well if not then political correctness is a mere token gesture to the excluded and disaffected voterIn sum this is an intelligently directed brilliantly acted thought provoking filmand arguably a must see!,0
1367,tt0031679,With the passing of his stooge senator Senator Paine and his businessman bosses need a new patsy to help get a bill through congress  When their party man is rejected they select the allAmerican Jefferson Smith reasoning that he will be too overawed and just do what he is told  At first Smith does just that but then his plans to build a boys camp on the site of the dam Paine is pushing through congress makes him realise that Paine is pushing a bill through for the benefit of Taylors business  A new boy with high ideals of democracy at this level Smith takes action but can he overcome the crooked political system that is controlled by Taylor?Apparently when this was first made it was accused of being antiAmerican in its depiction of congressmen as anything except honest God fearing men of the people  Nowadays it is more likely to be the case that the depiction of only ONE politician as `in bed with business or `remote from the people makes it look like a fantasy  But it is a fantasy  an ode to the American Dream  Smith is an honest lad who is picked for Congress holds to its ideals with a childlike wonder and overcomes anything that is `unAmerican As a story it works well in a sappy type of way  For me there was a little too much awe and wonder at the American system but I suppose it comes with the territory  The actual political games are enjoyable if a little simplified and the final odd minute filibuster is enjoyable despite not quite ending with the punch I was hoping forStewart plays his idealistic American boy well and his wide eyed wonder never fails to work  Jean Arthur is good as the `tough city girl won over by his honesty and charm and her sassy way helps liven some of the duller spells  Rains and Arnold are good in their roles as politician and businessman who bought the vote  The whole cast do well but it is Stewart who sets the tone with his awe and wonder  good but maybe could have been toned down a little to reduce the sentimentality that comes up every time he reads the bill of rightsOverall this is a good film  Typical fantasy stuff from Capra but heart warming in a way  It probably suffers little bit because it is hard to accept that politicians are basically good peoples  Where `its a wonderful life was uplifting because it was about human nature this didnt have the same impact because I dont believe that politicians are like Smith in anyway watching Bush and Blair stampeding through the UN with total disregard for democracy took some of the shine off this movie  Still a good movie though,0
