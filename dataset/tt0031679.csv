0,James Stewart and Frank Capra  One neednt know much more going in to be assured that this will be an enjoyable film  Together they take on the Washington elite with this dramatic comedy about a na√Øve Washington outsider who gets appointed to the Senate and stands alone against corruption and graft  Jefferson Smith James Stewart is appointed from an unnamed state after one of its Senators dies  He is appointed because the political fat cats need someone who will not seem like a crony but who will not stand in the way of a graft scheme for a pork barrel dam that will make bigwig Jim Taylor Edward Arnold millions  When the wide eyed Smith gets to Washington he discovers the corrupt bill because the dam will stand in the way of his own proposed bill for a childrens camp  When he tries to stop the project Taylors political machine frames him to make it seem like he is the one taking graft  This leads to the dramatic confrontation in the Senate where Smith filibusters in an attempt to get the truth outThis film is wonderful in so many ways  The story is a classic struggle between good and evil  In typical Capra style the protagonist and antagonists are exaggerated so there is no confusion as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys  If there is one clear message in Capras films it is that those with strong moral fiber never give up hope  He likes to create utterly hopeless situations for characters to test their integrity and rewards unswerving adherence to basic values and principles by triumph against the odds  I was dismayed to see a comment obviously from a young viewer of this film that said that the characters werent realistic because no one used profanity  This is a sad testimonial to our culture when it inconceivable to young people that there was once a time when profanity was the exception and not the rule Stewart is brilliant as the idealistic and awe struck kid from the backwoods who is overwhelmed by the glory of Washington with its monuments and history  The story brings us a confrontation between political expediency and idealistic principles with the message that the truly great men are the ones that dont compromise their principles to hold on to power  Stewart also brings a whole treasure chest of bumbling comedic sight gags that make him all the more lovable in the partJean Arthur is fabulous as the tough and savvy assistant who is jaded by Washington politics but gets a fresh injection of fervor as she listens to Smiths noble homespun philosophies  Claude Rains is also masterful as the adulterated Senator who sold his soul to corruption for a chance at the presidency  He plays the simultaneous sense of guilt and ambition with a torment that is clearly ripping his heart out and the power of both emotions portrayed in his performance makes his character both repugnant and pitiableThis film is a national treasure  It is in my top  list of all time  The story of corruption in politics and the greatness of the men who resist it is timeless and would not be lost on the politicians in Washington today  A /,10
1,Now I must admit that this is one of my top five favorite films There is a warmth idealism and kinda simple feeling of hope that makes one believe that things will work out in the end Capra knew exactly what he wanted and it shines Jimmy Stewart in the role of his life makes us believe what we know is almost impossible in todays crass worldClaude Rains is incredible as Senator Smiths evil mentor Jean Arthur as his confidant plays the part so wellthat we just want her to save the dayThe final scene where the filibuster is taking place is among the greatest ever madeBUT THE PROOF YOU ASK?In the early s I showed this film over three days to a group of  year old inner city teenagers I taught Political Science in a very difficult school in Chicago It was a new class and not all of the best students took itI decided to show this film at the end of the year just to see how long I could keep the students attention I didnt expect much Fifteen is a very tough age to keep any kind of attention span and it was at the end of the day   pm which made things worse As the film began there was rustling in the seats boredom that famous oh what a waste of time lookMind you this is  year old film about a white Senator in those old days and being shown to a totally AfroAmerican crowd of  year olds late in the day over a three day period which meant the students would have to wait till the next day to see what was going on By the end of the third day Capra had worked his magic and the entire class was spellbound by this film They were there till the very end and you could see how much they enjoyed seeing a film that they wouldnt have looked at in a thousand yearsComments were wonderful Any film that could accomplish this more than  years after its conception to a crowd that no one would believe would have any interest in deserves to be truly called a great film,10
2,The media and those in Washington DC cringed in  when Frank Capra Oscarnominated for directing come out with Mr Smith Goes to Washington Capra fresh off amazing successes like Lady for a Day It Happened One Night Mr Deeds Goes to Town Lost Horizon and You Cant Take It With You used his power to slap some bigwigs in the face with a powerful mediumthe motion picture The result was an immediate backlash by publications and politicians but cheers from critics and the audience As with society the critics and the masses won out as the movie is a masterpiece in every way A US Senate vacancy leads to a dilemma Who should be put in office? Everyone believes the apparently naive and gullible James Stewart Oscarnominated is the logical choice because he will be easy to manipulate and he wont rock the boat Stewart the leader of the Boy Rangers a local camp association for youngsters gets blindsided by many highranking officials who have alterior motives Oscar nominees Harry Carey and Claude Rains in particular when his idea for a national boys camp goes by the wayside Thus the only thing left for Stewart is to beat those in charge by beating them at their own gamecreating a filibuster a neverending governmental argument for his cause Stewart is solid as always here and the supporters love interest/reporter Jean Arthur and drunk newspaper man Thomas Mitchell included with the aforementioned players are all terrific throughout The Oscarwinning screenplay is deceptively intelligent and Capra just had the uncanny ability to mix comedy drama and interpersonal characterizations together to make consistently wonderful American film experiences  stars out of ,0
3,Since the beginning of the art form movies have generally fallen into two categories the realistic and the fantastic fantasybased  There are some that point out that the films of Frank Capra unduly fall into the latter that they are completely farfetched and fastened in their own time and even invented a pejorative term Capraesque to describe any noncynical heartwarming picture that has a message  His great films like It Happened One Night Its a Wonderful Life and of course Mr Smith Goes to Washington however are not fixed in a single era but all eras the truest definition of a classic  And considering it was released among true powerhouses in  a year as important to movies as  was to baseball its ideals story and general excellence shine as bright today as it did over  years agoA Senator from an unnamed middle America state dies and a new one must be appointed by Governor Hubert Hopper a puppet whose strings are held by newspaper magnate Jim Taylor  They need to find one that would be easily controlled by the nowsenior Senator Joseph Paine played brilliantly by Claude Rains so a bill allowing a building of a dam near land by the Willett Creek owned by Taylor can pass in the Senate  After his initial choice is rejected by Taylor and Taylors handpicked man is shot down by the public the governor chooses Jefferson Smith played to perfection by James Stewart a boy scout leader and local hero who is both wholly idealistic in his patriotism for America but naive and blind to the actual process  After he gets embarrassed by the local print media Mr Smith begins to learn the harsh realities of DC  Paine Smiths boyhood hero takes him under his wing and suggests that Smith try to create a bill Smith agrees and with his assistant Clarissa Saunders played by Jean Arthur they create a bill to create a campground for boys from all over the country to learn about each other and the civic process much to the initial dissuasion by Saunders  Smith then wants to choose a site near the Willett Creek the same site where the dam is to be built and when his superiors and true stringpullers find that out major complications ensueAlthough the basic premise is David vs Goliath the story is wholly originally and was probably one of the earliest pictures to suggest the government as corrupt  The characters are played excellently by all principal actors with Mr Smith you root for wholeheartedly Mr Taylor you root against for his sheer arrogance and greed and Mr Paine who you pity as you see a man who lost his initial zest to serve the public and is now a jaded shell of his former self  A great performance was given by Harry Carey Sr who plays the Vice President/President of the Senate for comic relief  The lines where completely believable and the parts of Smiths final filibuster that were shown give the most impact  There is a beautifully shot scene with images of the monuments and sights of Washington with several national anthems synchronized as the score  The climax is as tensionpacked as drama can get and while the ending may seem rather sudden and everything isnt completely or neatly resolved it works perfectly and ends the movie on a happy noteObviously few if any people elected to public office has the moral character conviction and general good heartedness of Jefferson Smith and I doubt whether the government would be better if it was  The movie showed an ideal a supposed lost cause of truth in government  And although it is next to impossible for Capra and the eternal good guy Jimmy Stewart to ever fully change the world of politics with just a motion picture at least it shows that maybe once in a great while being the good guy has its definite rewards  If using the same analogy of the  baseball season The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind were the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa of  moviemaking then this would be like Cal Ripken voluntarily ending his Iron Man Streak something done with full class and the highest respect in mind and that elevates an ideal of being the good guy and sticking to your dedication brings the greatest of riches  This picture is flawless in all respects and a true classic with thoughtprovoking ideas wit a little bit of platonic romance and an excellent cinematography and score and deserves the rank as a  out of   And in giving this rating either Im damn right or Im crazy,10
4,Frank Capra and James Stewart were nearly unsurpassed at the task of taking the kind of story that is optimistic but that borders on being trite and making it into a satisfying worthwhile movie In Mr Smith Goes To Washington they accomplish this with a little help from Jean Arthur Claude Rains and Edward Arnold Its not quite on the level of Its a Wonderful Life but it is as good as almost anything else of its kindStewarts performance is important right from the beginning  hardly anyone else could have been believable as the earnest unknown who suddenly becomes an important political figure Even his wideeyed appreciation for what he sees in Washington comes across believably As the story gets more complicated and his character is developed further Stewart is even betterThe secondary characters are also important because the story itself is a rather stylized though still worthwhile statement about politics The characters are more believable than are many of the plot developments Rains contributes a lot as Stewarts troubled colleague and Jean Arthur is a natural for this kind of role Arnold plays his devious character well Capra holds it all together with his craftsmanship keeping the story on track and getting the most out of the situation,0
5,It was a lot of fun watching Mr Smith Goes to Washington in a class where the professor noted how this was the sort of film that was of historical importance while not taking itself too seriously And I think thats the way Frank Capra wanted it in a sense Perhaps in the time of  America this film was seen as being of merit to the American Governments due though according to the trivia it was denounced at showing corruption and even banned for showing how democracy works But the director is also wanting to make an entertaining movie of the kind of Hollywood appeal that brings to years olds in attendance What had me interested throughout particularly in that climactic rousing twentyminute sequence in the Senate with Jimmy Stewarts constant unfaltering filibuster is how it really is a patriotic kind of bravura to be shown on the screen Here is how it SHOULD be done to an extreme perhaps in getting things done in government But at the same time Capra keeps it entirely watchable with that group of kids up on the balcony keeping the audience laughing and smiling all the way through the great lines that Stewart says Great principles dont get lost once they come to light Theyre right here; you just have to see them again! This is a kind of talent that Im sure few other filmmakers at the time or even after could have pulled offThe rest of the film isnt just Stewarts struggle to be heard as a young newintown senator Its also a witty more often than not true look of how government tends to really work as opposed to how it should Basically the core of the story is the fishoutofwater type where Stewarts Jefferson Smith one of his better Hollywood performances leader of the Boy Rangers is called to be the senator of his state He has a childhood hero in town in the form of a senior senator Claude Rains terrific as always And theres even a woman Jean Arthur in the mix thats growing an interest in him at first dubious But despite the corruption that is almost thrust upon smith by Jim Taylor Edward Arnold as skilled a character actor as could be asked for Smith fights it all the way to his final filibuster which includes a reading from the Constitution inandout cheers from the Boy Rangers and general guffaws from the other senators In other words its really much in that pure spirit of Frank Capra that Mr Smith is working in and even at its cheesiest and sometimes mostdated moments its a very successful picture for what it wants to do Its really an equalopportunity kind of film about people in politics that should be able decades later to appeal to both the hopeful and the cynical and it works as good as it does a comedy as it does a piece to show in history of film or American government course,10
6,Mr Smith Goes to Washington is a wonderful film about a man Jeff Smith James Stewart who believes that children are the future and should be able to enjoy the outdoors while taking in knowledge of their great Country When a senator dies in Smiths state the governor is forced into an awkward position of electing the new senator While the governor is sitting down to dinner his young children propose the idea of Jeff Smith who is head of the Boy Rangers and prints a weekly newspaper for the local children Mr Smith is elected into office in the funniest way a coin toss ,10
7,Mr Smith is as good as its legend Sometimes Im disappointed when a universally acclaimed movie isnt as enjoyable as I thought it would be But here that is not the case James Stewart is deservedly remembered most for this role Thats saying a lot given his impressive body of work This is also Frank Capras signature film along with Mr Deeds The idealism of Jefferson Smith might feel a bit anachronisitc today but and I know this is a clich√© the world could use more people with his values The supporting cast is also spot on Jean Arthur plays the same type as she did in Mr Deeds and Claude Rains is terrific as the mentor who betrays Smith Strongly recommended /,9
8,Frank Capras knack for getting the best out of JAMES STEWART and JEAN ARTHUR is demonstrated here with both stars giving superb performances Ironically Stewart would not win the Oscar for this role but was awarded one the following year for a lesser role in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY,0
9,In Mr Smith Goes to Washington a US senator suddenly passes away and Mr Smith is tapped to fill the position Unbeknownst to the honest decent Smith he is intended merely to be a puppet of the powerful forces that already control the states governor and its other Congressmen Smith collides headon with these forces and must fight to save himself and his values from destruction in the public arenaMr Smith directed by Frank Capra is not meant to be very realistic The basic plot and characters of Mr Smith are borderline ridiculous Smith goes beyond naive to the point of appearing ignorant and lacking in common sense at times He seems to have the civics education of a ndgrader Everything in the movie is exaggerated to the extremesCapras DC is likewise a caricature The US Senate is a united front of entrenched cronyism They move as one nonpartisan mass always supporting each other in their mutual corruption The media is easily herded into line an interpretation that probably strikes closer to truth although that system today has been undermined by the InternetStill if the true Washington is not quite as fraudulent as Copras version theres no doubt that it is probably perceived that way by many Americans today The film touches upon real issues that affect modern politics Its amazing how relevant certain lines and scenes remain after all these years perhaps more so todayWhat did bug me about the film was its shamelessly idealistic view of smalltown American heroes like Mr Smith Like a Bruckenheimer movie where Billy boy and Jim Bob from the ranch save the planet Mr Smith sometimes comes off as a selfcongratulatory pat on the back to the common man It rails against the elitism and special interest of Washington a popular sentiment todayThis might not bother me so much except that this country is just coming off an extended experiment of putting a commoner in a government seat of critical importance and things didnt turn out so hot As nasty cold and dirty as it may seem to place a compromising politician into DC that may be preferable to putting an oh shucks well golly gee I dunno kinda guy into a position of major responsibilityThis country has a low tolerance for corruption It has an even lower tolerance of incompetence,7
10,`Mr Smith Goes to Washington is not as well known of a movie as it should be  It is a very good movie that is very interesting and a very good way to learn how some things involving the Senate work  This reviewer absolutely loved this movie and wishes she could run out and buy it right now   It definitely grabs the audiences attention and keeps it there  While watching this movie this reviewer was laughing smiling getting really really angry learning and even getting a little tearyeyed  How can a movie that brings out all those different emotions in someone not be great or even spectacular!  `Mr Smith Goes to Washington is definitely one of the best movies ever made despite the fact that it is mostly about politics! Its still interesting!While watching this movie the audience might be thinking that the acting isnt half bad and is actually quite realistic  They would be right too! All of the acting is really very good and it draws the audience in and keeps them in  This movie was so close to not having one single cheesy line or unbelievable acting job that its really a shame that it did  At the very end of the movie Saunders played by                  stands up from her seat in the balcony and yells `Stop Jeff! Stop! and then falls to the floor  The line and the way       says it is very very cheesy and something the audience might find themselves laughing at  That line is just about the only time in the entire movie where the acting was lacking  James Stewart was of course phenomenal  He is a very good actor and one that should be remembered for a very long time  Hes awesome!The only other not so great thing about `Mr Smith Goes to Washington is the ending  Its a happy ending but well it just ends  Its an abrupt ending  It ends so abruptly that the audience isnt even expecting it to end when it does  It has one of those endings where the audience knows a bunch of things that will be happening they just arent shown happening This reviewer doesnt really care for those kind it is much better when you get to see the things carried out  Although the ending could have been better `Mr Smith Goes to Washington is still an awesome movie and the ending doesnt take away from that at all!This movie is so great that every person in the world should be able to see it because it is definitely worth the time it takes to see it,10
11,From time to time a movie comes along that holds up so well that it actually gets BETTER with age Mr Smith Goes To Washington is EXACTLY that type of movieFor a basic plot summary this movie tells the story of Jefferson Smith Jimmy Stewart a sort of wideeyed rube who only gets promoted to US Senator because of the political machine of Senator Joseph Payne Claude Rains whom the young Smith adores Once in Washington however Smith gets a rude awakening as to the real politics of DC With the help of a female aide named Saunders Jean Arthur Smith must decide whether to fall in line or fight the deep rooted corruption in the Capitol domeThis movie remains an alltime classic for two primary reasons It strikes such a simple emotional chord in all of us Even though deep down we know that corruption runs rampant in even the highest levels of government we like to cling to the ideals that the nation was founded on Well that is exactly the journey that Stewarts Smith viscerally takes us on We want him to succeed so badly because we all feel as if that is what WE would do in a similar situation I know Ill probably get a few downvotes for this statement alone but I believe that our government is as corrupt now as it has ever been Thus while watching Stewarts impassioned pleas for honesty and common sense my heart ached for the United States of America So not only does Mr Smith stand the test of time but it actually transcends itBasically this movie does to politics what fellow Frank Capra film Its A Wonderful Life does to Christmas If it were up to me this movie would be shown in every American Government high school classroom and on television sometime the week before every major political election It is THAT important in the message that it espouses,10
12,Besides a brilliantly written story and brilliant acting by James Stewart there is one element of this movie that cant be overlooked Jean Arthurs actingWith her voice and facial expressions she pulls you through the storyline The movie may be about Mr Smith Stewart but much of it is seen through Saunders Arthurs eyes  When she falls in love with Smith we cant help but do it tooThis is Capras opus and contains not one but two of the best acting performances Ive ever seen,0
13,Patriotic stirring uplifting absolutely mesmerizing¬Ö Here are just a few words that can be used to describe Frank Capras brilliant  film Mr Smith Goes to Washington Bringing together a stellar cast of both fresh and seasoned actors Capra manages to reach into each of our chests and wrench almost painfully at our heartstringsJefferson Smith James Stewart Its A Wonderful Life is a young enthusiastic patriot who resides in an unnamed American state but is known throughout it most especially by the young boys of the region as an unsung hero Head of the Boy Rangers Smith has a love of his country and of nature once quenching a potentially devastating forest fire singlehandedly After the unexpected death of a current Senator Governor Hubert Hopper Guy Kibbee is forced to choose a replacement Whilst his corrupt political boss Jim Taylor Edward Arnold urges him to appoint a handpicked stooge Hopper surprisingly decides to follow the confident advice of his own children awarding the job to SmithSmith arrives in Washington excited and idealistic no doubt modestly considering himself to be unsuitable for such a prestigious position He is proud to accompany the other current state Senator Joseph Harrison Paine Claude Rains Notorious a highlyesteemed man who was once great friends with Smiths father Unbeknownst to Smith however Paine had long ago abandoned his political ideals seduced by the promise of power and political longevity to make certain compromises Whilst Smith works tirelessly to submit a bill regarding the creation of a national boys camp at Willet Creek which he hopes will teach a new generation the value of freedom and liberty the devious Paine schemes to dam that same locality an act that will serve nobody but the powerhungry Jim Taylor When Paines cynical secretary Clarissa Saunders Jean Arthur informs Smith of these plans he determinedly attempts to speak his mind only to be quashed by the almighty Taylor MachineFrank Capra who had previously supplied Columbia Pictures Corporation with two Academy Award Best Picture winners It Happened One Night  and You Cant Take It With You  once again proved his undeniable genius something he would continue to do throughout his filmmaking career One oftencited example involves the romanticallyawkward Smiths second encounter with Paines beautiful daughter Susan Astrid Allwyn Rather than focusing on faces as would be the typical style for such a scene Capra keeps the camera firmly on Smiths hat as he restlessly shuffles it between his fingers frequently dropping it to the floor and stooping to reclaim it This shot tells us more about Smith than any facial closeup ever could!Finally James Stewart is unquestionably brilliant as the young idealistic Smith in one of his first critically recognised roles The look of absolute awe and wonderment on his face upon first witnessing the Capitol Dome appears truly genuine despite the fact that Stewart was merely acting against a projection For his highly memorable filibuster speech at the climax of the film Stewart dried out his throat with bicarbonate of soda to make himself sound hoarse an act that could potentially have destroyed his later ability to speak As we witness Jefferson Smith ragged and exhausted determinedly continuing to shout hoarsely at the Senate members we immediately understand that his voice is reaching much much further He is not just shouting at the Senate but he is shouting at the people; he is shouting at his country; he is shouting at us And we are right there alongside him quietly urging him along,9
14,I admit that I just saw this movie very recently and approached it as a typical teenager would in this day and age But I forgot how much I love Jimmy Stewart in Its a Wonderful Life one of my all time favorites and how much I love Frank Capra Well obviously I ended up falling in love with this movie too Of course its not a typical movie like wed see in theaters today Im not sure why people rate it based on that Old movies should be treated with more respect! They didnt have the technology that we did now and the most advance things they could do were corny montages  Really I found a lot of things funny in this movie that shouldnt have been but I tend to laugh more than anything; life is just better that way The boys in the entire movie were hilarious They were justso strange And for some reason it was okay for angry politicians to ram their huge truck into the boys car And it was okay for Jimmyboy to run around the streets punching people But in the end I believe those parts made the movie more enjoyable!The music the acting the directingit was all top notch in my opinion Well the music was a bit too patriotic at times but that was very appropriate Jean Arthur was very cute and played her role quite well And for some reason I fell in love with Claude Rains voicewhich means I fell in love with his character I had to convince myself that there was some good in him and I was right The story was just fine a lot better than a lot of movies around today! oy! We went over the corninessand the plot may have been a bit predictable but I really wanted it to end well Good needs to defeat evil in the end And sure the ending may seem a bit abrupt but what can they say after that? All is well! A very good movie Id recommend it to ANYONEyou might just be surprised hey can you believe it? I really hate history and I enjoyed this movie!,0
15,If I could choose one movie more than any other which was not only brilliant but highly significant it would be this one We live an an age when cynicism about politics is rife when people who get involved to change things for the better are more often than not dismissed as naive; this is a film which everyone who is cynical towards politics should see It doesnt hide the fact that there is corruption in politics but it does say quite clearly that there is a point and a value to standing up to itAs movie quotes go Jean Arthurs words to Jeff Smith deserve to be remembered Your friend Mr Lincoln had his Taylors and Paines So did every other man whoever tried to lift his thought up off the ground Odds against em didnt stop those men They were fools that way All the good that ever came into this world came from fools with faith like that This is a movie which can teach a very valuable lesson particularly those who despair of modern politics There is a way forward,10
16,What a wonderful film What an exaggerated corny fantastic beautifully acted exciting wonderful filmMr Smith Goes to Washington is a classic for good reason It reinforces qualities that many of us have lost along the way idealism strong unshakable belief never quitting honesty and commitment Today patriotism and American values have taken on another connotation They have become the property of the right wing But there isnt anything wrong with the kind of patriotism and American values expressed by Jefferson Smith which are different from what is being expressed todayIs anyone today as idealistic as Mr Smith was when he first came to Washington? Can one really win against a powerful force like the Taylor machine? As one who was involved in a legal case where the other side had all the clout and all the money I sadly have to answer that I dont think so In the real world as Court TV has taught us things dont work that way Is anyone as corrupt as Senator Paine and Jim Taylor? Sadly Id have to say probably Would they ruin anyone who got in their way? Yes Have they? DefinitelyMr Smith Goes to Washington is a fantasy but its a fantasy that uplifts us and reminds us of what we could be and like Jean Arthur says in the film maybe being jaded isnt such a good idea all the timeJames Stewart had the role of a lifetime and he was perfect Homespun intelligent boyishly goodlooking his career and tremendous popularity even today speak for themselves His filibuster scenes are incredible passionate and strong We were lucky we had him as long as we did There will never be another Jean Arthur was fabulous in her role as a streetwise assistant who finds something to believe in Claude Rains as the unlikable weak Senator Paine gives a powerful performance The bad guys  and Capra always makes sure theyre real bad  were all great As for Harry Carey the sympathetic speaker you want to hug him A fantastic jobFrank Capra knew how to make movies The pace is swift the story strong and the scenes tense and exciting One gets caught up in the world he fashions A shame it isnt real,10
17,Frank Capras fans give Capra high marks for his film making He was a great Director But Capras detractors said he was known for his corn rather than art If truth is art then Capra fails not to entertain but as a truth teller Capra is one of the first message directors In this movie he goes against the Washington establishment political hacks and powers behind the throne The sad fact is that nothing has changed because human nature has not changed Capra creates the Character of Jefferson Smith played by Jimmy Stewart in an great performance The supporting cast performs as well under the direction of Capra Whether Capra or the writers are to blame is not known but the Smith character is a caricature of a real person And because he is not real and the story is not reality If this movie was considered a comedy so be it but critics have had  plus years to consider this movie as a significant comment on good versus evil Stewarts character is chosen by a shallow Governor to fill a US Senate seat and his choice is not the best candidate for the job Nothing unbelievable in that  but Smiths character is stretched beyond belief To become a US Senator you must be at least  years old Smith is introduced as someone with the maturity of a  year old With no wife no girl friend; he acts like a  year old when introduced to mature women Taking a tour of Washington leaving his homing pigeons to the care of others is also the behavior of an adolescent Capra wants us to believe that adolescence is synonymous with honesty It is not Nor was his striking journalists who portrayed him as a dopeSomehow this idealistic character takes on the corruption of the world in the form of a junior Senator and conquers all And discovers love and gets the girl in the end If you like vintage syrup this movie is right for you Just remember its just a movie and in real life the bad guys usually win,5
18,James Stewart was simply magnificent in this memorable classic of a dedicated young politician who is appointed to the senate following the death of his states senator He wants to do what is best for his constituents He soon learns that in Washington this is not to be the case Corruption patronage et al are alive and well and functioningEdward Arnold in a supporting role is fabulous as the old style political boss The Stewart character represents what we need as leaders to run this great nation of ours Some real scene stealing is done by Claude Rains as the other states senator who has become corrupt His temperament is perfect for the part His seething by guilt and his denunciation of his fellow senator shows depth in acting His outburst at the end of the film is totally memorable He claims that he has compromised to get what he wants How far from the truth this really is! Jean Arthur as the secretary in the know is truly fabulous as well Newspapers can learn from this film They should Censorship still exists in Remember that great filibuster scene? Stewart acted his heart out Though he lost the coveted Oscar here the Academy rewarded him the following year for the comedy The Philadelphia StoryThis film should be a definite prerequisite for students in political science classes,10
19,The theme of one man being able to combat the ways of a longestablished system is not a new one In fact man versus machine is one of the oldest forms of conflict in cinema but this is a different kind of machine this Taylor Machine When a young naive and idealistic man by the name of Jefferson Smith James Stewart is placed as a pawn in the United States Senate he is honored and humbled by the job set out before him He sees it as an opportunity to provide a service for his country and even more so his people In Jefferson Smith we see everything that is good and wholesome in America One man who wishes for nothing more than an improvement upon a country that he already cherishes He intends to do everything he can to fulfill his duty as a newly appointed Senator However the people that put him there were not nearly as patriotic in their intentions Jim Taylor Edward Arnold and Senator Joseph Harrison Paine Claude Rains have conspired to put Smith in office in hopes that he will simply sit there and keep quiet while they pass a bill that will profit Taylor Smiths dream of building a national boys camp is shattered by Taylors scheme to build a dam in the same area The powerful Jim Taylor is forced to pull some strings in order to discredit the young senator so that his dam can be built The Taylor Machine frames Smith accusing him of fraud Shamed Smith is ready to leave Washington behind when his assistant Clarissa Saunders Jean Arthur inspires him to fight for his ideals just as his forefathers had Smith returns to congress armed with a new strategy to accomplish his goalJames Stewart gives one of his finest performances as Jefferson Smith the young passionately patriotic Senator confronting corruption in the government he holds so dear Jean Arthurs performance as Clarissa Saunders is strong while Claude Rains is forced to counter Stewarts inspired intensity a feat that I feel he accomplishes The filibuster scene is one of the highlights of the film and one of the more memorable sequences in American cinema Mr Smith Goes to Washington is a wonderful movie not just because of James Stewarts relentless performance but because it has quite a bit to say It is a statement declaring that ideals are stronger than the pages they are printed on and that it is our ideals and the spirit through which we see them realized that allows one man to topple the machine,9
20,Through a series of fortunate and unfortunate events an unsophisticated local hero Jefferson Smith is appointed a US Senator The people pulling the strings in his party and State figure that he will be compliant and malleable and basically stay out of the way of their plans some of which arent entirely ethical or legal However a wellintentioned deed sets off a dramatic chain of events a series of events that will see him at odds with his colleagues with the shadowy bullying powerbrokers and with the entire SenateBrilliant movie from Frank Capra While Capra also gave us such great movies as Its A Wonderful Life Meet John Doe and It Happened One Night this is his greatest work A superb indictment of politics and how democracy has been undermined and corrupted told with the trademark Capra brand of wholesomeness and practical idealism Considering how politics has even further degenerated since  even more relevant today than when it was released in Clever engaging plot that doesnt waiver for a second Not an ounce of deadwood in the movie  every scene is perfect and important Some great twists and turns and some great tension towards the end as Smith struggles to preserve his name and ideals Wonderful themes and morals too as you would expect from Frank CapraAdd in some excellent performances especially from James Stewart in the lead role and Jean Arthur as Ms Saunders Both received Oscar nominations as did Harry Carey for playing the President of the SenateIn all Mr Smith Goes To Washington was nominated for  Oscars including Best Picture but won only one for best original screenplay Unfortunately for it the  Oscars belonged to a juggernaut known as Gone With The Wind,10

22,Well this is like any other political film oozing patriotism where the small guy gets the big guy The underdog wins All American Better yet it is Frank Capra with James Stewart Can we get any more clich√©? Oh wait The main character is a Jefferson Smith Bribery corruption conspiracy lies and deceit It is all here Shady deals ulterior motives In other words politics In case it was not already obvious I am not very political But guess what? In all the above ways yes this is like all those other films But it the most important ways it is not What makes it different? In one word Stewart Sure the clever writing the directing the supporting cast are all assets to the film But he makes this film His characters name is in the title after all Through his heartfelt performance as Jefferson Smith the audience is inspired; even the most cynical of us might find ourselves beginning to really like this country appreciate what we have today that our ancestors did not and maybe even believe that we can make a difference by getting involved in politics His naivet√© is practically excruciating at times His first glance at the White House can be compared to a little kid in a candy store His first evening exploring all the monuments along and around the National Mall is shown in montage form with patriotic backgrounds music Cheesy yes But somehow it was not as bad as it sounds As he an everyday man tries to acclimate himself in the world of politics each blunder brings new laughs His awkwardness in palpable and his character lovable Eventually of course he must learn the truth that it does not really exist in the government We all cheer for this everyday Smith as he tries to pave the way for all the little guys As far as high school or even grade school education goes this should be on a list of required viewings Along with School House Rocks classic How a Bill Becomes a Law of course I would have loved to learn about government the Senate bills and filibusters this way **** Spoilers **** Sadly it was the ending that brought the greatest disappointment It was extremely sudden and cheap After all that determination and rallying from Smith; after how far Paine was willing to go to condemn the man he supposedly felt was like a son to him after all his stubbornness to do the right thing he gives up and confesses everything on the Senate floor? Highly unlikely Even worse it cheapens all that Smith has done,7
23,In Mr Smith Goes to Washington the legendary Jimmy Stewart plays the naive and somewhat gullible Mr Smith who is invited to become a senator by politicians corrupted by selfseeking businessmen who they perceive is rife for manipulation As such Stewarts character is a representation of Joe Public and how politicians manipulate the average voters views for political gain and moreover the corrupt businessmen and women who want to use their clout to pull strings which promotes their power and exacerbates their egos In order to emphasise this the accomplished director Frank Capra needs to contrive sympathy for the highly emotive issue of childrens welfare in the form of a boys camp here proposed by Senitor Smith When this is juxtaposed with hard and emotionally depleted business profit then there is no contest; the childrens welfare comes before corporate gain Arguably the methods by which corporate gain is achieved  in this case via corruption  is diluted by Capras emotive motive of using childrens welfare as a tool by which to direct opinion Nevertheless it is corporate gain via corrupt methods which tinges the philosophical ideology of existentialism To explain further existentialism is concerned with the idea of the self In other words placing the self at the centre of the universe As such the self becomes empowered In some circumstances this self has the potential to become a selfseeking force In this film that selfseeking force is the businessman who endeavours to gain via unethical means and corruption becomes associated with existentialism by default Hence existentialism becomes a negative force when juxtaposed with the utilitarian idea which champions that of the greatest good which is as Senitor Smith views written into American values which he naively permits to lead him without questioning the concept This value of the greatest good is the driving force of his cause for a boys campBut what will bring more benefit to society actually depends on how one interprets the ideas that are utilitarianism and existentialism which via opinion inadvertently contrive ideas of what is ethical and unethical which informs the voter of what is democratically acceptable To explain further the business venture is viewed in this film as unethical and thereby will be unacceptable to the voter Perhaps the narrative of the film should have balanced the viewers opinions by explaining that the business venture proposed has the potential to provide employment and spinoff enterprise for individuals As such these individuals would have the potential to prosper further and provide further employment and so on Meanwhile the boys camp would actually contrive a sense of good and thus instill into them another persons perception of what is ethical Is such paternalistic contrivance not just as corrupt in the sense of selfishness and self gain as any businessman or woman pulling a politicians strings? Further more Senitor Smiths paternalism would stifle the individuals freedom of thought Ironically such stifling of individual thought along with paternalism is what leaves voters such as that of Senitor Smith  remember here a representation of the average Joe Public  vulnerable like children open to manipulation by corrupted politiciansMeanwhile Capra utilises emotions which he purposefully exacerbates as a means of overcoming the otherwise monotonous bureaucracy at the heart of politics Without such affectation Capra would have lost his viewers to sheer boredom This is especially during the filibuster which Jimmy Stewart performs via the implementation of the sentimentality of an underdog fighting via the democratic process corruption within politics on behalf of his fellow citizens This affectation is juxtaposed by Capra in order to further achieve the portrayal of that of a man pleading for mercy after being assumed to be guilty For his convincing performance in this as the doggedly determined crusader of justice then Stewart deserves high praise Kudos also goes to the great Jean Auther whose implementation of her thespian skills serves to draw attention to her competent acting ability in the part of Clarrisser Saunders who coerces Senitor Smiths emotions The accomplished actor Claud Rains was also effective in his role as the politician corrupted by the unacceptable face of business which is as already suggested personified as that of selfishness Sailing so close to the political wind here Capra gives one potential reason for implementation and enforcement of the Hays Code as a justifiable force of stability within the United States film industry Retrospectively viewed with cynicism because it is perceived as constraining democracy within the art of film making the paternalistic Hays Code was originally written with ethical intention at the time of its implementation which was during a period of political instability throughout the world This instability was further exacerbated by the centralisation of the otherwise fringe politics of the far left and far right highlighted through the emergence of fascism and communism culminating in illiberal dictators in among other nations Italy Germany and the USSR Hence the films reference to dictators who ironically are used to promote the satirical point that proponents of illiberal politics are fascinated with Westernstyle democracy here undermined by Capras portrayal of it as an essentially corrupt force The time of the films production means that there is allot of political incorrectness An example includes the idea that boys as opposed to girls are the backbone of a nation But where would have Mr Smith been without Clarissa Sauners? Business is also highlighted as white overtly heterosexual male middle age and middle class But the question is have things changed for the better in a world of political correctness? Well if not then political correctness is a mere token gesture to the excluded and disaffected voterIn sum this is an intelligently directed brilliantly acted thought provoking filmand arguably a must see!,0
24,With the passing of his stooge senator Senator Paine and his businessman bosses need a new patsy to help get a bill through congress  When their party man is rejected they select the allAmerican Jefferson Smith reasoning that he will be too overawed and just do what he is told  At first Smith does just that but then his plans to build a boys camp on the site of the dam Paine is pushing through congress makes him realise that Paine is pushing a bill through for the benefit of Taylors business  A new boy with high ideals of democracy at this level Smith takes action but can he overcome the crooked political system that is controlled by Taylor?Apparently when this was first made it was accused of being antiAmerican in its depiction of congressmen as anything except honest God fearing men of the people  Nowadays it is more likely to be the case that the depiction of only ONE politician as `in bed with business or `remote from the people makes it look like a fantasy  But it is a fantasy ¬ñ an ode to the American Dream  Smith is an honest lad who is picked for Congress holds to its ideals with a childlike wonder and overcomes anything that is `unAmerican As a story it works well in a sappy type of way  For me there was a little too much awe and wonder at the American system but I suppose it comes with the territory  The actual political games are enjoyable if a little simplified and the final odd minute filibuster is enjoyable despite not quite ending with the punch I was hoping forStewart plays his idealistic American boy well and his wide eyed wonder never fails to work  Jean Arthur is good as the `tough city girl won over by his honesty and charm and her sassy way helps liven some of the duller spells  Rains and Arnold are good in their roles as politician and businessman who bought the vote  The whole cast do well but it is Stewart who sets the tone with his awe and wonder ¬ñ good but maybe could have been toned down a little to reduce the sentimentality that comes up every time he reads the bill of rightsOverall this is a good film  Typical fantasy stuff from Capra but heart warming in a way  It probably suffers little bit because it is hard to accept that politicians are basically good peoples  Where `its a wonderful life was uplifting because it was about human nature this didnt have the same impact because I dont believe that politicians are like Smith in anyway watching Bush and Blair stampeding through the UN with total disregard for democracy took some of the shine off this movie  Still a good movie though,0
