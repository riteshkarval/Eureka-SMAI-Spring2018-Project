0,Probably Buster Keatons best film and oddly enough its not even a straightforward comedy  its actually an action film with clever doses of romance and comedy tossed in for good measure  `The General which is set during the Civil War is about a train engineer named Johnny Gray Buster Keaton of course who tries to enlist in the Confederate Army    and is turned down because the army feels hed be much more valuable for the war effort as an engineer instead of a soldier  However through a series of misunderstandings both Johnnys family and his girl think hes a coward and they refuse to speak to him until he becomes a soldier  Months pass and Johnny sad and alone is piloting his train  the General  when it is stolen from him by the North  Johnnys efforts to recover the General  and to win back his girls love  become an unbelievably funny and actionpacked series of events as Johnny tries to go from being a sadsack buffoon to being a heroIf you havent watched many silent films they demand a greater amount of attention than `normal film  there are no audio cues; and volumes can be spoken with a simple facial expression  Buster Keaton is amazingly expressive as hes fully capable of going from wildly happy to downtrodden and sad in the blink of an eye  While funny Keaton is much more than just a clownish figure  he manages to evoke a lot of sympathy as well and he genuinely becomes what can only be described as an action hero as well  His timing whether for a joke or for a tender moment is absolutely impeccableWhats also great about `The General is the sheer amount of stunts and physical humor  a movie like this couldnt be made today  No amount of insurance would cover it  Keaton does all his own stunts and manages to perform a number of feats that are simultaneously hilarious and dangerous  he chases down `The General with a bike he sits on a moving cattlecatcher knocking away railroad ties with a tie of his own  All these stunts are fantastic but its scary to think that any one of these probably couldve killed Keaton if something even went slightly wrong  ,9
1,Buster Keaton once said that if he hadnt been a comedian he might have been a civil engineer He was not only a mechanical whiz but a spatial genius who devised stunts and gags with the grace of pure physics Its no wonder he adored trains the most elegant of machines and brought them into his movies whenever he could When one of Keatons former gagwriters loaned him a book recounting the theft of a locomotive from Georgia by Union raiders during the Civil War he was immediately fired with enthusiasm to bring this page of history to life His first certainty was that the production had to be so authentic it hurts He even insisted on using historically accurate narrowgauge railroad tracks which he found along with appropriate landscapes near the sleepy town of Cottage Grove OregonMost importantly the area had stretches of parallel tracks which allowed scenes of Buster on his trainagilely scrambling over the cars balancing on the roof to scan the horizon chopping wood for the engine while armies pass unnoticed behind himto be filmed from another train running alongside Buster his train and the camera are all in motion; the wind whips through Busters hair while smoky pinecovered hills rise and fall around him These scenes are not only the highlight of the movie but a peak in the history of *moving* pictures and they put to shame all later backprojection and process shots models and computergenerated effects The quality of Keatons filmmaking is simplypun intendedunparalleled Every shot in The General is clean fresh and efficiently composed; the action is captured honestly and legibly at all times The film never tries to be beautiful; its beauty is functional just like the grave masculine beauty of the locomotives and railroad bridges and Civil War uniformsThe Generals narrative structure is as strong and uncluttered as its look Like a train it stays on track never meandering for the sake of a laugh or a stunt All of the gags rise organically from the coherent and straightforward storyline Adapting the historical incident Keaton made himself the engineer of the stolen train Johnnie Gray rather than one of the raiders As he saw immediately The General is one long chase or rather two chases structured like the flight of a boomerang First Johnnie on a borrowed train the Texas chases his own stolen train the General He manages to steal it back and races it towards his own lines pursued by the raiders in the Texas who try to prevent him from carrying their battle plans to his own high commandThe General is not Keatons funniest film but here he was going for quality over quantity in laughs A number of the gags like the boxcar that keeps appearing and disappearing as it switches tracks have a long buildup for a relatively modest payoff But the laughter is mingled with a gasp of awe and the best moments never get stale on repeated viewings The cannon attached to the back of Busters train goes off just as the train starts around a curve so the ball flies straight and hits the raiders train coming out of the curve Riding on the cowcatcher Buster hurls one railroad tie at another lying across the tracks striking it precisely so that it flips out of the way A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his trains wheels so lost in thought he doesnt notice when the train starts to move carrying him up and down in gentle arcs stillness in motionI agree with author Jim Kline who describes The General as Keatons most personal film the one that best captures his unique vision spirit and personality In many of his films Buster starts off as an inept or effete character and develops into a hero But his competent ingenious and athletic character in The General who is also modest tireless and underestimated comes much closer to his real nature There is a shot in The General of Busters eye isolated on screen framed by a hole in a white tablecloth that has always reminded me of Dziga Vertovs kinoglaz the cameraeye Keaton melds with his camera; theres no distinction between his qualities as a performer and the qualities of his movies They have the same silence the same strictness the same strange blend of gravity and humorThe General might be the most serious comedy every made but its not a tragicomedy That as in Chaplins blending of pathos and low humor was something people took to immediately But no one knew what to make of The General Original reviews accused the film of being dull pretentious unoriginal and unfunny Even today people who have heard it acclaimed as one of the greatest movies of all time are sometimes puzzled or disappointed by it on first viewing The General is challenging because it doesnt flaunt its virtues; like Keatons concise and economical performance it holds a great deal in reserve Take the movies most famous shot of a train crashing through a burning bridge for which Keaton built a real bridge and destroyed a real train The shot lasts a few seconds in the finished film he doesnt dwell on it or hype it Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it? Keaton never forces a response from the audience never manipulates never overplays He doesnt show off his acrobatic skills or his enormous repertoire of comic talents nor does he play for sympathy Anything so subtle will always leave some people cold But for those who can see the expressiveness of Busters socalled stone face who get his peculiar dry humor who appreciate the rigorous purity and taste he displayed these virtues are all the more stunning because they are understated Buster Keaton always has more than hes showing; you can see it in his eyes,10
2,It is generally or should I pun and say General Lee? said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keatons career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past but getting the correct rolling stock costumes weapons and props to make it look correct And it worked so well that Keaton never really could despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR outdo it In fact the closest thing to his best sound film or film that he influenced that was a sound film was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE where he returned to a Civil War themeTHE GENERAL as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE is based on the Andrews Raiders stealing of the Confederate locomotive The General and an attached train which was used to damage tracks and bridges The raid in February  was from northern Georgia into Tennesee It only lasted  miles as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial Others went to southern prisoner of war camps The effect of the incident far outstripped its military success The damage after all could be repaired But like Jimmy Doolittles Raid over Tokyo in April  it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky/Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhileDespite it being a brief incident of the war the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south When Lesney did it famous series of Models of Yesteryear the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was The GeneralThe story however was ultimately a downer But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period First he changes the viewers perspective  it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men but on the Confederates Secondly he builds up the story of Johnny Gray a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier Because Keatons family and girl friend Marion Mack see he is not enlisted they believe he turned cowardJohnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake the General from the raiders and the film has actually two chases in it  first Andrews and his men stealing the train and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking itAlong the way are many comic classic moments such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train or when at a moment of dejection Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase and finding Marion Mack there helping him are wonderful  especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired she throws away the ugly little ones Keatons reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful momentThe classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river and the burning of the railroad bridge with its destruction of a second locomotive It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history By the way the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest He was Mike Turkey Strut Donlin a frequent member and starring player of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the th Century Donlin who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases left baseball to become a film actor he had worked a bit in vaudeville Keaton was a sports fan and showed this in his film COLLEGE where he shows his abilities in several sports and hired Donlin This was the latters most famous performance  look at his reaction to the collapseIt must be regarded as Keatons finest film and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures,10
3,No one will top Keaton for physical risk and risk is what deep film experiences are all about This might be classed as a comedy but for me it touches deeply enough Its about a man who needs to prove himself by taking risks and being true And its by a man who takes even greater risks and is more true True to the spirit of the social compact here displayed as the chummy southHes always done stunts that amaze Many of his other films have things in them that if the timing were only a little off hed be seriously injured or die But this takes the cake Its almost as if he started with the idea that hed have three locos to play with and had a year to think up stunts And the stunts are so physical! And so dangerous And so so very effective His trademark is the deadpan face placed as a sort of innocent cluelessness Its particularly funny when you see the physical movements and you know that  they take incredible preparation and timing to pull off and  the fellow you see that looks so puzzled by the reality you see is the guy that devised and directed those stuntsTeds Evaluation   of  Worth watching,0
4,I would have eventually gotten around to watching this film but my curiosity was piqued when I saw that it had miraculously jumped to Number # on the  version of AFIs Top  Movies of all time list It didnt make the cut at all for the original compilation in  so even before seeing the picture I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion I usually line up with the majority in most cases but I have to admit I dont quite get it with this picture I found it entertaining enough on occasion but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way its heralded on the DVD sleeve I dont think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy so right there my expectations were greatly reduced Keatons somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition dont help On the flip side I wouldnt have expected slapstick to move the story along either so at least I wasnt disappointed in that regardWhat I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity When Johnnie Gray Keaton dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army and pondered his situation while sitting on the trains connecting rod the resulting visual was pure genius The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnies thoughtful reverie and was one of the highlights of the picture for meThe other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge For starters I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb  unbelievableOh yes and I cant forget the sequence where Keatons marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a preCGI world its difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own For that Keaton deserves accoladesIn between all this clever film making however I just wasnt inspired The central plot element doesnt hold up for me  if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer why wasnt he simply told the reason why One could argue that then you wouldnt have a picture but for me it left the story on a shaky footing If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier the picture might have taken a different approach but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero Maybe Im second guessing a master but thats what I come away withConclusion  if this movie didnt make AFIs Top  Film List in  I dont understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top  At the same time Chaplins City Lights in my estimation a superior silent film fell OFF the list while The Gold Rush moved up a few notches I may not be a professional but I know what I like and this one just didnt do it for me,7
5,Buster Keatons The General about a man and his engine puts you in a world where the most comically inventive situation that could happen will happen From major comic situations to throwaway gags The General always knows what to doThe story begins in leisurely fashion A title card tells us that Johnnie Gray Keaton has two loves in his life his engine and his girlrespectively The General and Annabelle Lee Marion Mack Johnnie goes to visit Annabelle followed by two engineerworshipping boys and unknown to him Annabelle Lee herself He and his entourage arrive at the door; Johnnie polishes his shoes on the back of his pants legs slicks back his hair and gently taps the door with the door knocker Then he turns to notice Annabelle Keatons understated reaction is a testament to his uniqueness Any other comedian would have done an explosive doubletakeNow Johnnie and Annabelle are together in her parlor but the boys are there too Johnnie stands up puts on his hat and opens the door as if to leave The heroworshippers are ready to follow but Johnnie lets them out first then closes the door on them This is a gentle ruse in the world of silent comedy At Keystone both boys would have gotten kicked in the pantsNow the two are alone Annabelles father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon the War Between the States has begun Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist then turns expectantly to Johnnie who cocks his head like a confused puppy She asks Arent you going to enlist? Realization hits him and he leaps off the seat Before he can run out the door Annabelle kisses him This so overwhelms Johnnie that he flings out his arm in a farewell gesture and falls off the porchJohnnie races to the general store which is now a makeshift recruitment office Taking a shortcut he manages to be the first in line The door to the office is opened and Johnnie comes marching inonly he and the rest of the line go in two different directions and he has to jump over several tables to get in front again He gives the enlistment officer his name and occupation but the man rejects him Johnnie is more valuable to the South as an engineer Later Annabelle believes that Johnnie didnt even try to enlist She refuses to speak to him again until hes in uniform What follows is a classic moment Johnnie sits on the connecting rod of his engine Hes so miserable that he doesnt notice when he starts moving up and down until just before the train enters a tunnelTime passes and we learn that a group of Unionists are secretly passengers on The General When nearly everyone is off the train having dinner the Unionists climb back aboard and take the engine Annabelle a passenger herself was still on board She is now their prisonerBut Johnnie only knows his beloved General has been stolen possibly by deserters He pursues the engine by taking another The Texas Through a mishap he becomes the sole person aboard The Texas but the Unionists think theyre outnumbered and continue to run What follows is the true joy of the movie two long chases separated by an important plot twist Now the movie changes its quiet pace for almost nonstop actionI love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas At one point the car which Johnnie thought he had switched to another track reappears in front of the baffled engineer only to disappear later just as mysteriously We see the logical circumstances that lead to the cars seeming magic act and the equally logical situations that keep Keaton occupied preventing him from seeing what we seeComic logic is important to The General In no other movie do hyperbolic slapstick gags seem so plausible and inevitable In a throwaway gag Johnnie empties a burlap sack full of shoes because he urgently needs the sack Of courseof course!he loses his own shoe in the pile and must stop to hunt for itWe move to the second chase where Johnnie has The General and the Unionists are the ones pursuing him Now Johnnie must contend with Annabelle LeeMarion Mack leaves no mark of her personality on the screen She deserves credit mainly for being willing and able to take it Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn were never thrown around trod upon or knocked about the way Marion Mack was She has hilarious moments The excitement of the chase does not prevent her from taking out a broom to sweep the dusty floor of the engine An exasperated Johnnie tells her to keep throwing wood into the fire She takes a small stick and daintily puts it in Johnnie sarcastically hands her a sliver and she puts that in too Then in a moment that has an audience roaring and clapping Johnnie grabs her and halfthrottles her before kissing her insteadThe final section most of it a battle scene includes the shot where The Texas begins to cross a burning bridge only to crash into the river Owing to Keatons disdain of fakery one of several reasons his works seem modern he did not use a model but a real train on a real burning bridge The crash cost $reportedly making it the single most expensive shot ever in a silent filmA worthy closing gag was too taxing even for Keatons ingenuity Johnnies dilemma is to kiss his girl while saluting the passing soldiers His remedy is only mildly funny Is anyone complaining? The General is a work of art and a work of genius,0
6,This film flopped when it was released in late  for several reasons First its premiere was delayed because Flesh and the Devil was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks Second people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian not Buster the filmmaker and director which is more of the role he played here The film was funny but it was not gag after gag like so many of Keatons other films Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South A title card declares he has two loves  his girl and his engine when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession His girlfriend misunderstands thinks him a coward and says she wont speak to him again until he is in uniformMeanwhile the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Busters train Unknown to Buster his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train still without the knowledge of his girls captivity by the Union armyForgotten with the arrival of sound the film revived  often cut up from its original length  in the s because Buster didnt preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today often with poor video and hideous musical accompanimentToday The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too SHERLOCK JR is clever OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious The General is both of these things Its story driven races to a climax and is fueled by cute clever inventive gagsBuster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in A Southern Yankee,9
7,One of the great masterpieces of cinema Buster Keatons The General combines inventive humor with terrific action and fine melodrama all beautifully and carefully planned and photographed  It is filled with subtle and wonderful details that make it well worth devoting your full attention to watching  As an extra bonus it offers a fascinating look at the Civil War era with many realistic details inspired by a historical incidentAfter a short opening sequence the movie divides nicely into two halves Johnny Keaton is a railway engineer turned down in his attempts to enlist in the Confederate Army and subsequently rejected by his girl  Continuing with the railroad one day his locomotive is stolen by Union spies who also kidnap his girl  Johnny first chases the engine into Union territory to recapture it and then is himself chased by the Northern Army as he attempts to return home  Both chases are filled with excitement and manic fun with some breathtaking stunts by Keaton thrown in  It all leads up to a dramatic and memorable climax that includes many ironic and suggestive touchesKeaton is at his best with the story offering him a perfect showcase for his many talents  His slapstick and acrobatic skills are given free rein and his characters stoic perseverance is a fine complement to the frantic actionThis belongs near the top of any list of great films a classic worth watching and rewatching,0
8,I havent had so much fun watching a movie for a long time The General is a silent comedy mostly slapstick about Johnny Gray a train engineer with two loves his engine and Annabelle Lee Annabelle soon dumps him because of his failure to enlist into the Civil War they would not take him because he was too valuable as an engineer Things are then sped up a year where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan As it so happens they steal Johnnys engine a big mistakeBuster Keaton does a phenomenal performance as Johnny His face and character is ideal for this type of comedy He reminds me a lot of Leslie Nielsen from the Naked Gun movies but of course less old He is often ignorant of what is going on around him leading to plenty of laughs This also makes him a very charismatic characterThere are countless train related jokes The first one comes right at the beginning when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman in a line much like a train The bulk of the movie is made up of Johnny running a train either chasing or fleeing from the Union soldiers The movement and maneuvering of the trains is beautiful The stunt work is an incredible accomplishment The finale is explosiveThe General was a lot of fun to watch It gave me more laughs than most modern comedies and had plenty of substance on top of that This is enough for me to label it as one of the greatest comedies ever After my first viewing it instantly became one of my favorites It is timeless gem that should be watched at least once by anyone interested in movies,10
9,THE GENERAL represents the greatest achievement screen comedy ever accomplished From the brilliant gag construction to the sheer excellence of the filmmaking technique THE GENERAL is a hilarious and amazing journey into comedy Written and directed by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman Keaton brings brilliant gags into the story The film begins when Keaton is told he is of no use to the South as a soldier but as a train engineer However his girlfriend refuses to talk to him until he is in uniform After the war has started the girl is kidnapped by some Union raiders on Keatons train and so begins the greatest and funniest chase ever filmed For the next  minutes the viewer is in Keatons world His gags routines and amazing slapstick serve to make this the greatest screen comedy ever filmedMatt age ,0
10,Ive seen one other silent movie in my life but it was Mel Brookss The Silent Movie so I dont know if it really counts I really enjoyed The General overall more than I thought I would as someone who was born after The GodfatherThe main thing that surprised me was the fact that I couldnt look down to write very many notes; any time I took my eyes off the screen I ran a serious risk of missing something It seems to me that the film even though it was long or seemed so it was very dense in terms of action I imagine that since the movie has no dialogue the filmmakers must make up for it by making it as visually interesting and entertaining as possible I am accustomed to more modern movies with snappy dialogue and special effects and suchmovies in which you can look down at your popcorn or kiss your date and not miss too much because you can hear pretty much whats happening This was a nice change for meObviously Ive never seen a Buster Keaton film and Im not even sure if Id heard of him before this class But I can see why he is so appealing in his films I loved his facial expressions particularly the stoicbutcrestfallen look in his eyes on the train when something else goes wrong He also has great control of his body as we discussed in class and a fine sense of comic timingI found the film surprisingly funny Many modern films that I think are funny eg Austin Powers Toy Story American Beauty rely largely on witty or outrageous dialogue for their humor As a silent film The General must rely mainly on images for its humorthe slapstick images of Johnnie falling over constantly the unusual image of Johnnie riding up and down on the crossbar between the train wheels the stereotype exploitation in the scene when the girl sweeps out the locomotive Im sure that some of the things that I considered amusing might not have been considered funny by the original audience such as the recordscratch lightning bolts,0
11, Georgia USA The American Civil War is in its second year and Johnnie Gray is barred from enlisting He is a train engineer and the Confederate Army feel he is more valuable to the Southern cause in his current role than in the army This frustrates Johnnie and has estranged him from his sweetheart Annabelle who views him as a coward Then his beloved engine The General is stolen by Union spies and is heading for Union lines Moreover Annabelle is on board Johnnie sets off after the two loves of his lifeGreat comedy from the silent era directed and starring one of the greatest comedy directors and actors of that era Buster Keaton This is a rollicking adventure complete with wonderfully thoughtout and performed physical comedy and other sight gags Some very clever use of the plot to generate the comedyThe plot itself isnt overly profound but crams in a lot of action and adventure plus some romanceVery entertaining,8
12,THE GENERAL When one watches for the first time the General great things happen laughter relief a neverending smileand that old sniff of old good cinema I must admit not many films out there give the pleasure this one has It is like everything just falls right into place Overall the movie is a perfect account of all the things that make comedy great Simplicity good and twisted plot a sense of the unexpected becoming more and more realDo you feel me dont you? It has been attributed to Chalie Chaplin the following sentence to make a comedy film you only need three things a park a woman and a police officer We can safely say The General stands up to it Well there is no park in The General although the landscape is used wisely but theres a woman As for the police officerwell not exactly What we do have in the film are soldiers Im afraid of telling you the plot of the story because I dont want to spoil anything I reckon itd be better if you find it out for yourselves Well lets just say that Buster Keaton plays the main character an engineer whose beloved locomotive has been stolen by Union spies From that point on he does everything in his power to get it back Theres nothing more for me to say butEnjoy yourselves!!,8
13,To watch The General is to be both awed and amused at what takes place The consensus view is correct This is an amazing movieYou know whats more amazing? Despite what most critics say Buster Keaton made funnier better films than thisKeaton a lifelong railroad buff is engineer Johnny Gray captain of The General a locomotive which carries passengers and freight across the American South When the Civil War breaks out he tries to enlist and thus please his girl Annabelle Lee Marion Mack but the authorities deem him more useful running trains When Union spies seize the General with an idea of using it to burn bridges and disrupt the Confederate supply line its up to Gray to save the dayNew York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall reviewed The General back in  and expressed disappointment This is by no means so good as Mr Keatons previous efforts he wrote People cite Halls review as a classic example of whatdocriticsknow but the more I read the more I agreed with him The fun is not exactly plentiful he wrote noting Keaton here was too much the acrobat too little the clownWhen I watched The General I felt disappointment too Like Halls it wasnt total; its exciting and inventive and boasts some of the finest screen compositions Ive ever seen The technical expertise on display is astounding Its just that the overall experience left me a bit flatFirst you have what Roger Ebert liked to call the idiot plot Gray tries to enlist and is rejected by the army because hes too valuable as a train engineer Annabelle apparently never learns this for she rejects him as a coward I dont want you to speak to me again until youre in uniform she huffsEither hes an idiot for not explaining the truth of the matter or shes an idiot for preferring her lover be cannon fodder than a real asset to their cause Anyway Buster does manage to make this play later on When he finally speaks to her he is in uniform an enemy uniformThe other main issue involves what Lincoln called the slows A lot of the story is literally trainwatching Buster does some brave amazing stuntwork and throws in some clever gags later joined by Mack whos no Sibil Seely but still quite game but its basically a lot of watching trains go by The craft here is in the precision of the camerawork and the splitsecond timing not so much the comedy In fact except for Buster himself everyone plays it completely straight probably because this is real history being presented Compared to other Keaton comedies it feels a bit straitjacketed by thatThe General is still a solid thrill comedy with some amusing one liners If you lose this war dont blame me Johnny yells after being rejected and brilliant sight gags like the fussy Annabelles rejection of unattractive firewood while Buster struggles to stoke the engineTo me thats enough for The General to be another good reason for loving Buster Keaton I just cant understand it being the preeminent reason Maybe critics cant really love a comedy for just making you laugh and laugh Im just glad Keaton made other movies at least as brilliant as The General and funnier too,7
14,Buster Keaton s performance in The General was purely enjoyable The story takes place during the civil war on centers on Johnnie Gray Keaton a train operator in the South Johnnie is not accepted for service in the confederate army because of his value on the railroad and suffers the shame of being home while the other men are fighting a war When his beloved engine is hijacked by Union soldiers the unpredictable story goes into overdrive Johnnies adventure includes train chases rescuing the love of his life a daring escape and a climactic battle This film has a distinct action/adventure aspect but at its core it is a brilliant comedy/drama Keatons performance is superb He has the ability to effortlessly change your mood and the mood of the film with his facial expressions and physical comedy Keatons character seems to make endless mistakes that work for the best and good decisions in dangerous situations It is easy to imagine Keaton as a major influence for a future comedians and I personally felt like I was watching the Mel Brooks of a previous generation The General was a fun film to watch with a true star Buster Keaton turning in a timeless heartfelt performance,7
15,When watching The General  the similarities between Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin are almost unmistakable The story was original and humorous and the performance by Buster Keaton was pleasing What I didnt like was the fact that the protagonist still was pursuing the girl who was so quick to leave him when she thought he wasnt brave and then ends up staying with her at the end He is too good for her I thought the stunt where the bridge gives out and the train falls was very well done and must have cost a fortune There were scenes where I found myself laughing out loud and scenes where I was bored So unfortunately the film doesnt do a great job at keeping the viewer glued to the screen but overall it was enjoyable,7
16,I feel the The General is a great silent film because even though the story line is relatively complicated the way in which each character played their part and the way it was filmed made it easy to follow I am fairly new to the silent film experience and when I saw that this movie was partially a comedy I was expecting something more along the lines of Charlie Chaplin however I was pleasantly surprised at Buster Keatons more subtle comedic style I felt that the film was well shot shot considering the technology of the day I was actually shocked during the scene where the Rock River Bridge collapsed under The Texas Knowing full well it was not special effects I couldnt believe the producers would spare the expense of destroying a locomotive and an entire bridge This movie is sure to be one of my favorite silent films,7
17,Buster Keaton always amazes me He was truly one of the most hilarious deadpan screen clowns of early cinema And The General even clocking in at around three hours is surprisingly watchable based on his physical performance aloneGranted I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything thats unnecessary but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments There are multiple points in the General a story about a Southern engineer that has to rescue his beloved from the clutches of the North in the Civil War where Keatons character Johnnie Gray has to stop his train jump out and remove something from the tracks which in itself can be quite boring but the way that Keaton injects physical comedy into those moments keeps me entertainedAnd its a marvel how so many realistic yet comedic stunts that Keaton could come up with Its nothing fantastic like some of his other films but its still funny And I think the strongest point of his comedy is his completely stonefaced response to all adversitybut he lets you see just a little his plight in his eyes and its just enough to know that he is frightened but that the rest of him doesnt react similarly creates such an amusing dissociation that it goes from bizarre to funny Whether hes pratfalling due to surprise or erroneously succeeding at something hes unskilled in and being shocked by it that response of his is winningBut the General does show its age a little It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesnt get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context I wouldnt dare cut those moments out of this film even if I could reedit it because the space always had something going on but at the same time this film if made today would be cut to oneandahalf or two hours and pack in the comedy more tightly The plot and story are simple but exist more than to just help the comedy move alongexcept at the end when the first story was accomplished Then we move into a second extraneous but still amusing story regarding a battle between the North and the South that couldve been excised and still having a decent though simple storyI didnt really love the score that the DVD company attached to it which is a number of classical pieces end on end I think a new commissioned soundtrack wouldve better matched the piece but I guess we get what we get And on the plus side you can always mute the movie and play whatever on top of itIs it perfect? No But despite the age it shows it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinemas greatest physical comedians If you want to spend three hours with a silent clown this is not a bad way to go /,8
18,Have a lot of appreciation for comedy especially the witty and sophisticated kinds and there are a good deal of classic comedies that go for the broad approach too Am significantly less keen though on the vulgar puerile style of humour that is seen quite a lot today the worst of it veering on the offensive There are many instances of silent films/comedies seen with Charlie Chaplin prime Laurel and Hardy and with Buster KeatonKeaton is seen as one of the greats by many but for some reason doesnt seem to be quite as well known even with a just as good reputation critically as Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy who transitioned better into sound maybe when at his best in the s an extraordinary period with a deservedly lauded reputation he was every bit as great as funny and as likeable His daring physical comedy and stoic deadpan expressions were unique and ahead of its time at the time and still amaze and are distinct now plus he was a bigger risktaker with bolder material and immense courage that most wish they could have Which perhaps hasnt been more apparent than in this film The General often considered one of his best and most important films or even his masterpiece though with other just as worthy efforts it has been debated and justifiably so This paragraph is very subjective of course and probably wont be agreed with but that is just my respectful stanceThe General to this day still looks great and remarkably lavish something of a technical achievement in its day It also should be used as an example of how to have effects that still look good and like a lot of effort and care went into them and also use them properly rather than overusing and abusing them to gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now The locomotive features heavily here and to ingenious and quite imaginative effect The direction keeps the momentum going with ease and balances all The Generals elements every bit as adeptlyWhen it comes to the humour which is very physical it is never less than very funny and is timed inventively throughout no corniness at all and it gels very well But The General is much more than just a comedy and one can say that its not really one It has other elements too and executes them even better actually especially the action the scope dexterity and boldness of it and especially those stunts absolutely jawdropping and truly exciting to watch It is also an example of how to have action that thrills while being easy on the eyes coherent and not being too noisy or busy something to learn fromAlso here is a tender understated quality that is very surprising and the romantic element is genuinely charming without being sappy The film also has a story thats easy to follow and at the same time is logical and interesting indicating a film with brains as well as soul that treats the viewer with respect rather than getting irritated by credibility straining and logic lapses Keaton is superb here not only is his comic timing on point but he provides a character thats endearing and worth rooting for His physicality and how he copes with the stunts is aweinspiring and he is one of not many to make deadpan interesting and entertaining because he still makes it very expressive and nuanced The rest of the cast are easy to overlook but are just as strong even if with not as much to do or with material that sticks in the mind as muchOverall brilliant and a Buster Keaton essential / Bethany Cox,10
19,There are some truly wonderful scenes in this film which is full of adventure comedy and some pretty impressive stuntwork on moving trains by Buster Keaton and the other actors The premise is that Keaton a train conductor has volunteered to fight for the South at the outset of the Civil War but been turned down When his train is stolen by Union soldiers he immediately gives chase on foot then a handcar briefly a bicycle and then finally another train not knowing quite yet that his girlfriend Marion Mack was inadvertently also kidnappedIn one of the memorable early scenes Keaton is sitting on the connecting rod of the locomotive lost in thought when it starts up bobbing him up and down In another he packs a cannon on his train with a massive charge and as its angle slowly descends before firing it appears hes going to blow himself up until his train at the last minute hits a curve and he nearly hits his intended target Its just wonderful There is also of course the scene with a Union train going out onto a burning bridge which then collapses one of the most iconic and expensive scenes of the eraIn addition to those big moments there are also innumerable little things Keaton does which highlight his genius He is just so lovable and talented He uses one of the large railroad ties intended to derail him to knock another off the track as his train is moving When hes hiding under a table surrounded by Union officers hes subtly kicked and jostled in funny ways As he makes his escape with Mack he stuffs her into a large sack that he had emptied of shoes only to lose his own shoe in the process and struggle to locate it I also thought I saw bits of Woody Allen in the scene where he urges her to be quiet only to knock things over and make noise himselfAmbitious aweinspiring influential clever and still funny + years later Is it the best ever? I dont know I liked The Cameraman  even more but still – damn good,9
20,Buster Keaton is Johnnie Gray a southerner who wants to fight for the cause but gets rejected because he could be of more use as an engineer than as a soldier Unfortunately hes not told why he was turned down and his gal just assumes that hes a coward Not so because when a Yankee scallywag steals his beloved steam engine the titular The General Johnnie heads north to recover the engine and through a series of misadventures becomes a hero of the Confederacy and rescues Annabelle Lee Glorious sight gags abound as Old Stone Face deals with errant cannon loose sword blades uncooperative firewood inexplicable soakings and a lessthanhelpful rescuee not to mention an entire army of bluebellies Great fun from another era and a wonderful example of the silent genre,8
21,Buster Keaton plays the lead in this silent era masterpiece that takes its inspiration from the Great Locomotive Chase which in turn was a real event during the American Civil War in which a train was stolen by the North and sped over the lines in preparation for the coming offenseThe General has some definitive upsides working in its favour Buster Keaton is an amazingly versatile performer able to go from clownish jokester to a saddened victim of war and poor circumstances in a heartbeat The film is also really ambitious in scope Keaton performs all of his stunts most of them hairraisingly dangerous and completely unimaginable nowadays Plus very little money is spared and the film famously has some of the most expensive set pieces and stunts of the silent eraThe plot of the film is also a lot more cohesive than say in the films made by Charlie Chaplin in the same decade Chaplins films usually contain segments that have little to do with anything except the need for funny situations The General is also a comedy but with a clear clean story arcOn the other hand I didnt find the humour or the characters as captivating Theyre okay but in this regard the decades of cultural development between the film and yours truly work against the film I just didnt find the slapstick all that funnyStill The General is a great watch for all interested in early cinema or really involved physical humour,0
22,The General is one of the great films and treasures of the silent era Its among the best movies of the talented comedy actor Buster Keaton In this film Keaton shows the athletic ability and courage that made him one of the best of the early comedians who performed their own stunts His physical antics on and off his train The General support his title as king of comedy stunts All the silent era comedy actors seemed to have lots of energy And many had daring courage and even madness at times Those were the actors who did all or most of their own stunts While there were some stunt men around in the early s it wasnt until the last of the silent years and dawn of sound pictures that stuntmen were a regular part of the cast of films that required any amount of derringdo And while a small number of actors today will still do some of their own stunts nothing can compare to the actors of old who performed their own highrisk and dangerous stunts – and sometimes those for other actors The five best early actors at doing stunts were Buster Keaton Douglas Fairbanks Sr Harold Lloyd Tom Mix and Yakima Canutt The latter two specialized in Westerns and besides acting and doing stunt work Mix and Canutt regularly rode and performed in the rodeo circuit Lloyd was versatile in his venues but excelled at high stunts on buildings and sometimes with wild animals Fairbanks excelled in swashbuckler stunts sliding down the sails of ships swinging from anything hanging aloft and jumping with the help of trampolines into windows Keaton was even more versatile As a child actor in vaudeville Keaton learned how to fall to avoid injury He called his technique soft falls or landings But even with his training and practice his film roles with derringdo often left him bruised at the least At other times he had suffered injuries from slight to serious Still he had become known for his physical resiliency During the filming of The General in  Keaton was knocked unconscious by canon fire He suffered a broken ankle while filming the  short The Electric House And he broke his neck during the  shooting of Sherlock Jr but didnt know it until years later This movie has an interesting plot set during the US Civil War It opens with a scene and script that reads The Western and Atlantic Flyer speeding into Marietta Georgia in the spring of  The train seems to be traveling about  miles per hour But the film is almost entirely about action and the comedy in the action involving the train There is an element of romance The cast all are very good The photography is superb Much of the action with trains is filmed in Westcentral Oregon from Eugene to Cottage Grove Theres no information about sound at all so I assume the music we hear with the film is soundtrack that was added for modern viewing It probably is meant to replicate the piano accompaniment that was usual with silent films in theaters of the day This is one instance when I think the piano playing would have been better The music seems to go overboard at times This is one of the early great films from the silent era that showcase the talent and early mastery of moviemaking skills Its a fun movie with strong visuals that even a modern family of all ages should enjoy,10
23,Johnnie Gray a train engineer tries to enlist in the Confederate Army to impress his girlfriend Unfortunately he is rejected because his role as engineer is deemed more important Lucky for Gray he is given the opportunity to prove himself when a band of Union soldiers in disguise hijack a trainAt the time of this films release it was a flop and considered to be not very funny Since then it has gone on to be declared one of the greatest films of all time Funny how that works I would tend to agree that it isnt really very funny but it is a great film for a variety of reasonsBuster Keaton was an amazing actor and director He was willing to put himself in dangerous situations for a laugh  he was his own stuntman right there when the train falls in the water really sitting on the side of a moving train and on the front of it he could have been killed And this was captured on film flawlesslyPersonally I enjoyed his Sherlock Jr better I thought the tricks were better and the action funnier It had a faster pace too that kept me hooked enough to watch it a few times The General was not boring but as a silent film it could have done more to grab the audience and Im not sure that it did,7
