0,Fritz Langs highly influential career as a film director began in post World War I Germany where he was a leading figure in the German Expressionist film movement and ended in the United States in  with the production of The Big Heat a film noir classic Perhaps his greatest film M Germany  forms an historical bridge between expressionism and film noir Like the former it uses strange and disturbing compositions of light and dark in order to symbolize the inner workings of the human mind; like the latter it more realistically sets its story in a modern urban setting and blends in sociological issues along with the psychological and moral ones Even though M was Langs and Germanys first sound film many historians cite it as the initial masterpiece of cinema to appear following the introduction of sound into films in the late s While most early talkies return films to their static visually monotonous stage imitative beginnings and thus limit rather than expand the artistic possibilities of the medium M avoids the failing by skillfully balancing asynchronous offscreen sounds with the more limiting use of synchronous dialogue The films editing particularly its elaborate use of parallel cutting also contributes kinetic energy and fluidity to the storytelling Of course many of the films sound effects are also imaginative and memorable none more so than the compulsive whistling of the films central character the stalker and serial killer of little girls Hans Beckert magnificently played by Peter Lorre Sound is also an important contributor to Ms rich and influential use of off screen space One famous example is the scene that introduces Beckert as a shadow against his own Wanted poster creepily intoning to his next victim Elsie Beckmann You have a very pretty ball Not only is Beckerts shadow a bow toward Langs expressionist artistic roots but it ironically places the murderer in the implied space in front of the image  that is among us the human community of viewers of which he is an innocuousappearing albeit monstrous member Another example of Langs use of offscreen space is the montage of shots whose common denominator is Elsies absence from them an empty chair at the Beckmann dinner table the vertiginous stairwell down which Elsies mother searches compulsively and futilely for signs of her daughters arrival the attic play area that awaits Elsies return from school Most memorable of all  and most often alluded to visually in other films  is the series of shots that indirectly record Beckerts assault and murder of the innocent child representing these off screen events metonymically via the entry of Elsies ball from bushes along on the right edge of the frame and the release of her balloon from telephone wires and off the left edge of the frame Never in the history of cinema has something so terrible been communicated through such powerfully understated imagesBeyond its technical brilliance the keys to Ms lasting impact are its psychologically convincing portrait of Hans Beckerts twisted compulsion and the still relevant ambivalence of his capture and trial Unlike contemporary cinematic examples of the serial killer Beckert is not presented simply as a grotesque psychopath Nor is the issue of how society should deal with him at all clearcut To be sure the gutreaction of most film audiences is to root on the underworld mobsters and petty thieves who beating the established authorities to their mutual quarry capture Beckert and bring him to a mock formal trial whose conclusion is foregone Like many in America today Beckerts accusers are disinclined to listen to insanity pleas and would just as soon be rid of the monster in the surest way possible a summary death penalty with as little fretting about legal rights as possible Considering the heinousness of Beckerts crimes and the imperfections of a legal/medical system that could well turn him loose to kill again this emotional response is hard to resist Yet M is by no means an endorsement of vigilantism  quite the contrary Through the unlikely rhetorical persuasions of Beckerts unkempt court appointed defense attorney and Beckerts own impassioned monologue Lang strongly implies that impatience with democratic judicial procedure and a paranoid eagerness to scapegoat others guilty or not in the name of order are symptomatic of the social hysteria breeding Nazism in s Germany That the ruthless killer who heads the underworld looks dresses and gestures like a Gestapo officer is no accident Moreover the letter M chalked on Beckerts back by one of his pursuers not only stands for murderer but also alludes to Gods marking of Cain While the popular misconception holds that the mark of Cain symbolizes his evil it in fact represents Gods warning to Cains flawed fellow creatures not to mete out wrathful vengeance but to leave justice in Gods hands Translated into secular terms and literally entering the shot from the top of the frame Gods hands in M belong to the legitimate authorities that intervene at the last moment to arrest and try Hans Beckert in the name of the Law,10
1,M /  **** 	M is a cinematic masterpiece of visual drama The stunning performances define the careers of exceptional actors such as Peter Lorre and Gustaf Grundgens Director Fritz Lang gives depth and dimension to his production by distinctly capturing the ecstasy of the films many characters and focusing accurately on individual situations This is an intriguing journey into the mind of a psychotic child murderer blending terror complexity and malignity in one amazing motion picture	Screenwriters Paul Falkenburg and Adlof Jansen construct the characters of M with distinctive personalities and three dimensional emotions Many lesser filmmakers give their characters no creativity outside the confines of the script In this movie each individual character has a mind of their own; they are free to roam the landscape of a inviting atmosphere	Fabricating such an impressive atmosphere is some of the best cinematography and lighting effects that I can remember watching This resplendent component creates the films terrific moody ambiance Suspense is one thing M contains in full context The movies third act is sheer peakhigh tension	Shot in black and white M stars Peter Lorre as PeterHans Beckert an extremely disturbed child murderer in the process of wreaking havoc on a neighborhood Parents everywhere are living in fear of their children being kidnapped and abruptly annihilated 	This picture contains a brilliantly crafted setup The visual setting creates a strongly developed opening Every scene works to either complicate the initial problem or propels the story through a firm narrative through line	The film captures the chaos of the town in terror perfectly M is more about the results of a serial killer than an actual serial killer Never do we directly witness a murder; the violent encounters are implied This method of film making perhaps makes the movies impact even greater With an creative perspective through a third person point of view the filmmakers repeatedly give us examples of a solid structure through characters and occurrences 	M offers a unforgettable challenging performance by Peter Lorre This extraordinary actor is tormenting and disturbing without embracing in extreme violent conduct He perspires with momentum and rapture This productions closing scenes are so deeply penetrating they entirely captivate the viewer Isnt this what movies are supposed to do?,10
2,M is a monumental film and seriously should be watched by all For a film like this to be made in  is just shocking Even if the film was released today it would still be nothing like we have seen before In our modern age of film making there has been a considerable rise in the production of films about serial killers their complexities and particularly about pathological ones Yet M is the first movie that comes to my mind when I think of the themes that have been in Psycho Silence of the Lambs Seven and not to mention countless moreThe film is lead by Peter Lorre in a transcending performance who plays the serial killer and rapist in which the film is centered around In this performance Lorre is successful in something that at the very least is rare to see in any kind of film compassion for a child killer and rapist Lorre makes the viewer see that he is not a criminal by choice but by a sickness of compulsion Too often then not is our perception of a psychotic killer having that look that puts fear into his or hers victims eyes Lorre doesnt do that but rather displays a frightened man a scared man One in which his desperation leads to his hazardous behavior His portrayal of a killer is not of a fearless one but of one consumed by fear Something that even today we as a people cannot understand let alone in The direction and writing of Fritz Lang is beyond comprehensible as he taps into the mind of a serial killer and his complexities He does so in such that we get an empathetic and compassionate illustration of all sides of the story This in which by then end of the film all points of view are more then well delivered to the audience Fritz Lang here has simply created here a timeless masterpiece One that excels in its technical aspects and enlightens the audience on a topic that other films still have not yet to match M inI highly recommend this film for many obvious reasons and conclusions This film was created by one of the all time great directors in Fritz Lang Langs command for the screen is mesmerizing and a joy to witness and so on and so forth Yet much of this is mostly superficial and a waste of time to continuously state M as I mentioned before takes a strong and original stance on an issue that we as a society yet have not fully resolved This film may not give you THE answer on this issue but it may sway that moral compass of yours that lies inside of all of us,10
3,The economy austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound and precise filmmakers Lang a master of the German expressionist film shot his first talkie a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies It was a shocking idea for its time based on the reallife killer Peter Kurten headlined as the Vampire of DüsseldorfM is about a terrorized city and a plump little man with wide eyes often chewing candy who is a pathological childkiller unable to control his urge for killing The film embodies several Lang themes the duality between justice and revenge mob hysteria the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in and for probably the first time in the cinema it adds a new dimension to suspense pity For the killer is clearly mentally sick He cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease and yet we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal rather than treated as a sick man Early in the film the killer is heard whistling the Grieg theme from In the Hall of the Mountain King This theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace And when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window the melody on the soundtrack told us chillingly that the murderer is there just out of sightThe Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since Casablanca The Maltese Falcon and The Mask of Dimitrios When the photographs of his victims all little girls are shown to him he jumps back and twitches with horrorWith powerful visuals Langs motion picture is Lorres first film His performance as the corpulent hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion Lorre is the archetypal outsideroutside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal He had only twelve lines of dialogIn the most famous of all about a pathological killer  Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho  Anthony Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy Psycho reeked with blood and horror whereas the suspense of M is subtle A childs balloon without an owner a rolling ball are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed The audience trapped in its seats torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight,8
4,The first time I saw M by Fritz Lang I almost didnt know what to make of it I was overwhelmed by the power of the performances the staging of the scenes the locations and the power that the simple story had with such complex circumstances Then I saw it again and a third time and I know that this is one of the best films ever to come out of Germany its a powerful statement about protecting our children if youre looking at it as a message movie but in reality it is just a piece of cinema heaven Thrillers today only wish they could draw a viewer into the mystery elements and have such unconventionality of the times Boiling down to this M is about a child Killer  the legendary character actor Peter Lorre in his first major role  who snatches children when their parents dont watch and continues on until an investigation goes underway But as the police investigate overly thoroughly into the real criminal underworld they know something is up that this is someone far more gone than they could ever be so they join in the hunt This all leads to one of the supreme dramatic climaxes in any thrillerOn the first viewing I just went straight for the story which is able to suck one in enough to make you feel dizzy But on the multiple viewings it becomes even more interesting as one can study the intricacy and indeed fullon artistry of Langs camera He puts it in unusual places at times and adds for good measure shades of dark and gray in many of the night scene this is by the way a precursor to filmnoir which Lang later became an important director in the s and s On top of this there is a very modern sense of style in the editing I remember a couple of scenes that surprised me editing wise One is where the cops I think it was the cops have an argument about the investigation two of them get into a shouting match and we get medium closeups of them going back and forth This is done quickly with a kind of intensity that isnt even captured in todays thrillers There is also the hunt for Lorre in the digging of the house where Lang cuts around constantly heightening the tension between the predators the criminals and the prey Lorre until its almost too much to takeThe disturbing aspects of the story of child abduction and murder have become benchmarks of a number of todays thrillers where the cop is usually the subject and the killer left more in the shadows in cat &amp; mouse style This doesnt happen here and because of it by the time we get to the final scene with Lorre being interrogated and giving his I cant help it speech it becomes something poetic tragic frightening Lang doesnt leave his message so simplistically he makes sure we know Lorres side too however twisted it has become and the antagonist is shown as human as opposed to these presentday thriller where the killers are barely given one dimension let alone two There were reports that during filming Lang put Lorre through torture ultimately causing the two to never work together again But nevertheless out of this comes a towering performance of a small wildeyed criminal in the midst of an extremely welltold and unpredictable mystery story In short if you dont know what youre in for when you hear that whistle those several infamous notes you may not at all,10
5,The opening scene of this movie is the first clue to its near perfection  A mother preparing dinner for her child waiting anxiously for her to return from school  Her hope and then distress as she hears people pass outside her door  While down in the streets of Berlin her daughter is receiving a balloon from a strange man in a long black coat  We know whats going to happen but its still horrific to watchFritz Lang you cinematic god!  A simple story of the underworld the police and a single man holding an entire city hostage and done with such precision and prenoir darkness that is oozes creepy suspense from beginning to endBut this movie is not so simple as the police inspectors trying to catch a devious murderer  its about the mob employing its network of beggars and petty thieves also trying to bring the killer to their own brand of justice Apparently the police crackdown caused by the murders is bad for business  so the mob begins to track him down as wellIts not only a great crime story and perhaps the first physiological thriller the murderer is schizophrenic but theres comments to be made here about the nature of justice and who should best dispense itIn all not only a trailblazing classic but THE trailblazing classic,10
6,This is a very interesting film on so many levels Its interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture  Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place  what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding Compare it with any American film from  and you cant help but see the differenceThe murderer artfully played by Peter Lorre has been killing children that have no link to him personally for months The police despite all of their efforts are unable to catch him mainly because there is no rhyme or reason in his choice of victims At first there is a focus on the victims and the hole left in their families by their killing Then the film shifts to two normally opposed groups  the police and the underworld After several months of no results by the authorities the police are unhappy because it reflects badly upon them and the underworld is unhappy because their activities are being disrupted because of the police doing constant raids in their efforts to capture the killerIn a particularly welldone part of the film the scene shifts back and forth between a conference of police and one of the underworld They discuss how they are going to catch the killer The police settle upon the idea of looking for people with a history of past mental problems that were pronounced cured and released The underworld decides to enlist an invisible group  the beggars  to follow every child at all times and therefore catch the killer Both groups focus on the right suspect the question is  who gets there first? M is a fascinating film that raises many topics  the death penalty a group of criminals that are criminals by choice causing less stress on society than a lone criminal that acts out of an uncontrollable compulsion and the motivations of the authorities often being their own bureaucratic survival rather than the larger issue of ending a series of horrible acts against humanity,9
7,Being a huge fan of German Expressionist art Im naturally drawn to the films of Fritz Lang  I recently was able to see the restored version of Metropolis on the big screen and was delighted to see M on the Sundance channel  especially since it was the uncut version  M follows the trail of a child killer Peter Lorre sought both by the police and the members of the underworld whose businesses are being effected by the investigation ,8
8,This movie is definitely one of the scariest movies Ive ever seen Its about this childlike pity evoking man brilliantly played by Peter Lorre who also happens to be a psychotic child killer The city in which he lives is of course panicked by the mysterious childkillings and both the criminals and the police starts to haunt the man down I wont reveal more then this but I will say this Just because its an old movie dont let your guard down This movie is one of those rare movies which are so good that youll never forget them,10
9,In an eerie propagandist fashion the phrase in the name of the Law is repeated over the last two scenes of Fritz Langs M as a child killer is brought to justice If L represents the State and the Law then M is meant to represent the Individual who in this case is a Murderer Lang boldly asked us way back in  whose rights come first the State or the Individual? A master of his craft Lang leaves the question openended and lets the audience decideM is shockingly contemporary in its psychological complexities It explores the psychology of individualism vs group think while showcasing how a state of fear can be inflicted upon a populace when a government fails to protect society from a single individual terrorizing the people The story is fairly straightforward An elusive citizen begins killing innocent children in a large nameless German city The media fuels a paranoid frenzy that incites the public The clueless police begin to raid the underworld after the populace is turned into a raving mob because of the failure to capture the killer The underworld comes to a screeching halt as their business is ruined by the police and starts their own manhunt for the killerUnlike a modern period piece that attempts to evoke a certain place and time M WAS a certain place and time Lang in an almost prophetic sense captured the state of mind of the German people in  as the Weimar Republic was on the brink of collapse and the Nazi Regime was preparing to take over When individuals live in a state of fear as they do in M society collapses and the Individual is crushed Only the State it seems can bring orderM is a also a masterpiece for its technical aspects The way in which Lang uses his camera to move through windows capture shadows reflections empty spaces and shift pointsofview is staggering even by todays standards He also played with the new technology of recorded sound with extensive voiceover narration and dialogue used to overlap and transition between scenes Didnt critics recently praise Michael Clayton for utilizing just such a technique as if it was something revolutionary? One can also see a protean style the would eventually birth the Film Noir movement with the creation of tension and suspense in the use of shadows and camera anglesYet M is not perfect It has some major flaws There are no real characters in the film to speak of in the modern sense The film is virtually all built around mood and plot The only time Lang invites us to emotionally connect is in the opening and closing scenes with a mother of one of the victims and in the classic scene of Peter Lorre giving his writhing and primal I cant help it! speech in front of the kangaroo court of criminals The mothers grief and Lorres madness are presented so sparsely and in such a raw form that it becomes too painful to want to connect with them Another flaw that is often overstated about films from this time period is the slow pace of the early police procedural scenes These inherent flaws combined with the inherent brilliance of Langs vision make M one of the most challenging films a modern viewer could ever sit throughWhat impressed me most about M was the subtlety of the symbolism Lang created with his haunting images As harrowing as the story is none of the gruesomeness is shown on screen Its all transmitted to the viewer through the power of suggestion Is it any wonder Hitler wanted Fritz Lang for his propaganda machine which thankfully led to Lang fleeing to America? Ill never forget the wide shots of the kangaroo court and the looks on those peoples faces as the killer is brought down the steps for trial or the vast expanse of that empty warehouse The scene of the ball rolling in the grass with no one to catch it the balloon caught in the telephone wires and the empty domestic spaces the mother has to inhabit after her child has been murdered are the types of scenes that tape into Jungian archetypes and shared fears The look on Lorres face as he confesses the hand of the Law coming down to save Lorre from being lynched and the ghastly plea from the mother in the final scene will stick with me for the rest of my life M is a communal nightmare; one that from which we have yet to awake,10
10,This is one of those movies that will stay with you for the rest of your life  The characters are ugly and disturbing there is nothing cute in this movieThere are constant parallelisms drawn between the police and the underworld and the common way in which they operateWe also get to journey into the mind of the madman  If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs you should see this alsoOf course you must be patient enough to deal with subtitles and the fact that this is a very old movie  one of the first talkies  But most viewers will get something out of the dialogue even without knowing the German language,10
11,Great story with incredible development of ideas and feelings while giving the audience an indepth perspective for each side to an extremely difficult issue to resolve  Every film lover should take the time to see this film for its ingenious style and execution of ideas  Adds a little comedy in interesting ways to help entertain and engage the audience  Acting is incredibly real and heart felt  Dramatic and tender to fit to any interest,0
12,This movie is so intense and enthralling it doesnt have to hide from even the most amazing Actionmovies But unlike the most actionmovies it really has a story to tell with a very interesting conclusion at the endWhen people talk about Fritz Lang they always talk about Metropolis but I think this is his masterpiece This movie MUST HAVE inspired pretty much every police movie or show ever made Rarely have I rated a movie a  with more confidence than this oneEND OF REVIEW so I dont have anymore lines but they make me write  lines apparently so Im writing this I know a joke ehm well its not a good one so I will quote GEORGE BESTI spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars The rest I just squandered,10
13,Watching Fritz Langs M is watching the history of cinema unfold before ones eyes Made in the transition period between the silent and sound film this  masterpiece remains fascinating for several reasonsFirst of all the use of sound is impeccable Suffice to say the killer in the movie is caught is through identifying his trademark whistling But the use of voiceover narration was also new at the time and is used here very well first when a mother calls in panic for her missing child and her name echoes across several empty walls Next in a scene in which two detectives elaborate on what theyve done to apprehend the killer and everything they say is matched by an imageSecondly few times has a serial killer been treated with such complexity compassion and straightforwardness in cinema Peter Lorre plays a child murder a man who acts by impulse possibly a schizophrenic He simultaneously evokes horror and pity and hes too distant from the supercool and erudite serial killers of today Lorre plays one Hans Beckert a lonely man with a history of mental illness an ordinary man without any qualities or amazing traitsThirdly its a powerful meditation on vigilantism and crime The police is unable to capture the killer so Berlins underground decides to capture the criminal The police raids are putting them out of business and they resent the fact that a child killer is being sought amidst their ranks The absurdity of bank robbers and card cheaters with a sense of morals is not lost on the filmmakers In a mocktrial at the end these same criminals think they have the authority to sentence the child murder to death But as he tells them if they wanted if they got jobs and worked honestly they could leave their lives of crime; a man whos ordered by voices to kill cant just turn off him impulsesBut above all M is a fascinating exciting thriller Its an intelligent crime story that shows police and criminals working on different sides and with different means to achieve the same purpose If one can laugh at the idea of a criminal union realism should never be a criterion for judging art one cant laugh at the policemen in this movie Inspector Lohmann played by Otto Wernicke is one of most intelligent detectives ever to grace cinema Hes fat hes cranky hes an unlikely hero but hes shrewd he can read a persons personality at a glance hes patient Lang must have liked him too because he used the character and actor in his following crime epic The Testament of Dr Mabuse in which Lohmann shows even greater skillsI knew or at least highly expected that M would be an amazing movie But I didnt imagine a yearold movie would hold up so well in terms of cinematography sound pacing acting structure Few movies achieve such a synthesis of qualities There is no doubt on my mind that M deserves the recognition it continues to receive from film historians,10
14,In my opinion this is just an OK film Except for some little stylistic tricks there is nothing special The story is OK how it is told is rather weak in some parts its even ridiculous the acting is mostly very weak except for Lorre who you dont see much of anyway and the sound quality is horrible something you cant blame it for but I had to use HEADPHONES on full volume to even understand the words! but switching from sound to silent all the time is very distracting and has no dramatic effect at all even if some say so  the opposite is the case it seems very amateurish The slow pacing is typical for its time And suspense? I dont think so In my opinion the main reasons why this film is so critically acclaimed areA Lorres overacting Whenever overacting has a purpose its critically acclaimed And his acting as a madman is very effective B Id call it heavy look The topic seems heavy and the plot and style seem all too heavy and important You almost want the film to be successful so you search for it in Lorres acting As a justification so to say Im sure you like the film for many other reasons too Some more important reasons maybe But that doesnt mean Im wrong Its a film we want to like and where you dont want to look for the flaws Well long story short I dont think the final result is a success There is too much Average in it and the Great isnt all that great Metropolis Nosferatu Caligari Sunrise I think have all a more stunning look All silent and all made before M Dont get me wrong the cinematography is good and also inventive in little parts but not THAT revolutionary that it deserves the reputation it has Probably the flaws are too big for me to fully appreciate the rest Like every time one said He doesnt leave any marksblah blah I had to laugh He talks with the kids in the middle of the day in the middle of the street he walks along the streets with them he goes into shops buys stuff for them he makes mad gestures in public And then he also whistles this damn song all the time so loud you hear it from three streets away while everyone in the audience knows from beginning on that this will be his doom /,6
15,While many of the problems of early sound pictures lampooned in Singin in the Rain were more or less myths the early talkies did present a big challenge for filmmakers everywhere Europe however was at an advantage over Hollywood because even though it took them a few years to gain the same access to sound technology films from the US would be screened abroad only six months or so after their first domestic release Thus directors like Fritz Lang were able to witness Hollywoods first faltering steps with sound before giving it a go themselvesIts funny how sceptics dismissed sound as a gimmick because the best early uses of sound were those that treated it as exactly that – a gimmick Lang demonstrates in M that a talkie need not be an entirely new kind of motion picture; sound is merely another layer of technique Rather than getting bogged down in lengthy dialogue scenes Lang keeps his storytelling primarily visual and when he needs lots of expository dialogue he intercuts multiple scenes to keep the pace going This is not to say Lang is trying to ignore sound – in fact he uses it to enhance the picture sometimes having dialogue or other noises take place offscreen to focus us on reactions or causeandeffect Other times he ironically uses completely silence something of course you never get with silent pictures due to the continuous musical score giving a dreadful sense of eerinessAnd thankfully the best elements of Langs method have survived the talkie revolution His visual style is particularly effective here in provoking a chilling disturbing atmosphere Shot compositions with large blank areas give a sense of surreal starkness Characters often stare intensely straight at the camera aggressively drawing the audience into the films world Several times we are even dumped straight into the pointofview of the killer himself The fragmented narrative with its lack of lead characters and impersonal pointbypoint plotting could easily be boring but Lang holds our interest by keeping a dynamic sense of rhythm and telling the bulk of the tale through pure wordless imagery Langs German pictures in common with typical German cinema of the time feature highly melodramatic acting and exaggerated almost comical characters These figures generally suited the fantasies and comicbook stories of Langs silent days but Im not sure they sit so well with the closetohome setting of M Still these characters are somewhat more effective now that they have voices probably because most German screen actors of the day were from a stage background Peter Lorre was a shameless ham but thats what you need to play a psychopath and in any case hes a lot better here than in many of his Hollywood roles Otto Wernicke is also incredibly entertaining in the role of Inspector Karl Fatty Lohmann; again a stagy exaggeration but with some absolutely wonderful gestures and comic timingThere isnt a lot else I can say about M – it is one of those pictures that has been analysed to death – although I doubt any comment other than mine mentions Singin in the Rain in the opening line  While not quite Langs best picture I can think of few directors who made such a smooth transition from silents to talkies and sadly this was his penultimate German picture before the Nazis took over Theres no denying that Lang was wasted in Hollywood He did his best to understand it but by and large it never understood him I say by and large; the renowned Irving Thalberg was reportedly bowled over by M and screened it to many of his writers and directors as inspirational material Had that prestigious and influential producer not died in  the same year Lang began working in Hollywood would things have turned out differently I wonder?,9
16,Masterpiece is the word most film buffs and historians probably would use to describe this  Fritz Lange film based loosely on the events of a reallife serial killer a few years prior to the film In this movie the killer is Hans Beckert Peter Lorre who lures children to their deathsThough the story is about a child killer the theme of M centers more on societys obsession with the murders From kids playing games to adults going about their everyday lives everyone is on guard suspicious combative and very vindictive For selfish reasons even the petty criminal underworld wants the child killer caught But the police are ineffective and a selfrighteous mob mentality takes over The whole film is really a study in the terrifying psychology of group thinkAs it turns out the killer is less monstrous than pathetic and compulsive Beckert cant help himself Hes a short squatty bugeyed little man who cant control the devil within Lorre was perfect for the role and his acting is flawless and mesmerizing Yes the killings all offscreen are awful But the militant lynchmob mentality is just as scary Beckert is the only individualist in the filmPart silent film and part talkie the B&amp;W visual style of M is wonderfully expressionistic and baroque There are lots of overhead camera shots Background sounds like honking horns and whistles are precursors of major plot pointsWhat strikes me most about this film is its tone I can think of very few films that are so harsh so bitter so malicious so punitive M contains not an ounce of humanism Langs exwife Thea von Harbou a Nazi sympathizer wrote the film just before the rise of Hitler The films angry militant tone thus foreshadows Hitlers Third Reich from  until  Lang himself fled Germany and ended up in the USYour own personal preferences in films will determine whether you consider M to be a masterpiece or overrated or perhaps somewhere in between But individual preferences aside there can be no doubt that M is an important film historically Every person who wishes to be versed in classic films needs to see M at least once,0
17,A serial killer who favors children Peter Lorre is on the loose in Berlin He is wanted by the police But even worse for him he is wanted by the Berlin underworld who have been targeted falsely by the police for being involved Watch out child killer! There is nothing bad I can say about this film The acting the directing the sound all perfect Many have praised Lang for his use of sound at a time when the practice was just coming into play And rightfully so Whereas other films have sound matching what is on the screen Lang realized he could use the effect to signify what he was not showing including the murderer who has a distinctive whistle Brilliant Not to mention that one key role is a blind beggar a man who cannot appreciate visuals but only sounds he is appropriately the man who can identify the killer! Basing the story loosely off of childmurderers of the day Grossman Haarman and Peter Kürten this is one of the darkest tales set to film up to this point There is no blood and no children are actually seen killed And the killer is relatively reserved compared to his reallife counterparts who were also rapists and cannibals He presents an interesting defense his crimes are less wrong than the crimes of others because he cannot psychologically control himself Or in modern terms not guilty by reason of mental defect Is a child killer less evil than a pickpocket? Is he in some way also a victim?I enjoyed the idea of a unionized underworld I do not know the reality of this as it seemed sort of comic and anticipated such villainous teamups as we might see in comic books But crime was certainly not unheard of and even black market meat existed and I am not sure if I really want to know what that meansMany including reviewer Stanley Kauffmann have noticed the similarity between M and Bertolt Brechts Threepenny Opera Sadly I have not seen Brechts work and cannot comment on the comparison German philosopher Theodor Lessing best known for his work on Jewish selfhatred may even have been an inspiration due to his work on Haarmann But regardless of inspiration Lang is the master here his work stands the test of time and today almost a century later is widely recognized as one of the greatest achievements on film At the least many consider it the alltime greatest German film And rightfully soThere are so many great shots including the socalled inventory shot of the criminal underworlds wares Lang also excelled with the camera angles using knives as frames and getting more than one great mirror shot I should also give credit to cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner who previously worked on Nosferatu and many others  his reputation should be second only to Karl FreundThere is nothing that beats the Criterion release with commentary short films and more I watched the film this way on DVD Perhaps a Bluray release has even more but I would not even know what could be added This disc is packed and a mustown for any film historian or Lang fan,10
18,Outstanding German expressionist film from Fritz Lang that follows first the police then the underworld as they search for a child killer in Berlin The cinematography is moody and dramatic as the story moves through the poorer sections of the great city and the acting while of a more melodramatic style than is currently popular is very good* Peter Lorre is outstanding as the killer who taunts the police as the noose slowly tightens around him To some extent the film is an early procedural drama as the police use then modern forensic techniques such as finger printing and graphology to try and find the killer Tired of the increased police surveillance the citys criminal element begins their own search mobilising the numerous beggars to be eyes on the street The film touches on a number of issues that are as relevant now as in the s including mob mentality men are accused of being the killer simply for talking to a child rights of the accused the end justifies the means use of torture and the ever thorny issue of mental health and culpability One of the great preWWII German films *I watched a subtitled version on TCM,10
19,M like Manichean? What can you say of a plot driven by criminals and where good people are rather inefficient for the most part and where the most despicable character earns our own sympathy This is a movie using such stark blackandwhite contrasts noir in its soul and gray in its coreM like Mob Mentality? Fritz Lang personal Jaccuse against a system where accusers arent all innocentM like Maturity? The film also consecrates German Expressionism as a peak of creativity and social relevance a sequence in history where Berlin became literally the best area and arena of expression to an art that had reached its maturityOr M like Mörder murderer in German Maudit in French doomed and Masterpiece in the universal language of cinemaM like Menace and MusicChildren are singing an elimination game of ominous undertones later we see little Elsie playing with the balloon a shadowy silhouette appears the face remains unrevealed while we hear the whistling of In the Hall of Mountain King Before the shark theme in Jaws to the Psycho shrieking violins the Peer Gynt tune became the first notable leitmotif meant to suggest an evil presence the perfect device to put us in the victims standpoint for the first act as powerlessly as the poor mother calling Elsie while her balloon the bait used by Hans Beckert is drifting along the telephone wiresThe effects are then shown through the growing fame of the new Jack the Ripper figure the ensuing paranoia with any adult basically talking to a child is assaulted The killer is a menace to an already crisisstricken society forcing the police department to triple the efforts psychiatric cases are explored handwriting analyzed and daily and nightly raids operated to make further pressure on the criminal worldM for Methodic For its second act M is the seminal police proceduralWhile covering that angle with a documentarylike precision Lang still seems dubious about the polices efficiency and provides an interesting twist by paralleling the work of the law with the outlaws In a long sequence where both sides brainstorm about the methods to use to find him we swing back and forth from one world to another and the only indicator of the side of the law were put in is the presence of uniform last time I saw criminals acting like politicians in a masterpiece it was in The Godfather One even points out insightfully that the killer must be a bourgeois because its the very standard of life that provides the level of idleness driving any easily corruptible mind to the most extreme cornersM like the sign on the shoulderSo in a famous sequence criminals helped by the street beggars find Hans Beckert quicker than the police force he was betrayed by his trademark whistling and irony a little girl who noticed the infamous letter marked on his shoulder The following chase takes maybe too much time for the films own good Not saying the film could do without the struggle to catch him but the court is such a high point of cinemas history that the previous part seems more forgettableAnd Peter Lorre with his round face innocent eyes when hes cornered like a rat and utters his memorable speech gives the performance of a lifetime as a living symptom a man incarnating the sickness of a society where bad people toy with justice and the worst of all acts as childishly as his victims claiming innocence with such rabid eloquence hes almost convincingBeckert says he cant control his impulses a little voice urges him to commit the irreparable acts and his body language is simply gutwrenching when he simply cant put words His lawyer makes a good point about the past of some accusers whose Becket call hypocrites because they could choose to be honest but the accusers retort that whether hes responsible or not hes still a menace Sure whether their reasons are selfish or ethical is debatable but can we empathize with Beckert?M like ModernityLooking at Twitter or Youtube or Facebook comments today you can tell theres something ferocious and still ongoing about mob mentality and a film like M could be deemed as feeble and liberal in the way it provides a tribune to a child molester the worst possible crimeM like MultilayeredYet there are some powerful truths hiding underneath the thriller the truth about a society sick of its own contradictions determined to impose standards of morality white and condemning true crimes black but indulgent toward activities that have no worse repercussion That the film ends with blackclad mothers admitting their own responsibility is perhaps the most optimistic thing about M the sentence doesnt matter what matters is the lesson behind but did German learn the lesson?Ironically one could have seen the rise of the Nazi empire as the antidote like Thea Von Sarbou who wrote the film and worked for the Nazi regime other could also see it as its worst possible consecration like director Fritz Lang That he didnt side with the criminals at the end emphasizes an intuitive comprehension of his world and allowed this film to be hailed as a true intelligent nightmarish and alas premonitory masterpiece with M as the mark of a disillusioned geniusM like Meditative? Mysterious? Mantic?Interestingly the French title is M le Maudit meaning the doomed one as if Beckert was the living incarnation of a doomed society as if there was indeed something rotten in the Weimar Republic and It wouldnt get any better after but could Fritz Lang anticipate it? Looking up his second masterpiece M I was wondering whether Lang reflected his own rejection of German society or cared enough to warn the audience against the impending doom of decadenceSurely the director behind Metropolis could only pinpoint with the accuracy of a soothsayer the limits of a civilization that might take its heritage for granted,9
20,This movie has it all! This is one of my alltime favorite movies Many people have criticized it because its from  and I say Who cares when you have such a great movie? Peter Lorre gives a  star performance as the child murderer and may I say he is very very haunting Fritz Langs direction is superb; the cinematography is superb! The kangaroo court scene at the end is my favorite part and its brilliantly done The plot is very well crafted Even more amazing is the plot focuses around catching the murderer but it is not boring for one second Each scene flows beautifully into the next with some amazing chases raids and facial expressions This is also a movie ahead of its time This is definitely one of the alltime best movies!,10
21,Fritz Langs second absolute landmark after the equally brilliant but completely different Metropolis and also his first opportunity to work with the wonders of sound And boy did he ever deliver a great piece of work! Like the M for murderer is marked on Peter Lorres coat the film M for masterpiece is branded on cinema history annals for all eternity Langs film is a triumph in every possible viewpoint and it covers a lot more genres and elements than just simply the manhunt for a childmolester*** SPOILERS ****The horrors M handles about is timeless and of all cultures but yet itll always remain a taboo subject and for that reason alone Fritz Lang deserves extra praising In an utterly astonishing way Peter Lorre portrays Hans Beckert a child murderer who singlehandedly terrorizes four and half million people simply by his uncontrollable urge to kidnap and molest young schoolgirls The grim and haunting atmosphere is terrifically built up by images of previous Beckertvictims and the disappearance a new unfortunate girl Her toy rolling of a remote hillsa balloon drifting away on the wind Really simple but extremely efficient methods to reflect the ominous actions that just took place Other than to focus on the further actions of the killer Lang turns to the effect this terror has on the city and how the manhunt for Beckert develops Our director is obviously fascinated by how a police procedure is organized and he serves the viewer a detailed overview of all the steps taken by the investigators Meanwhile he grabs the opportunity to forcefully criticize the medias influence and the German law system with both hands Id really like to stress that Langs subtle mockery was a really risky thing to do with the upcoming Nazireign so you cant admire him enough Due to the constant and fruitless raids the police are holding in the hope to capture the killer the criminal underworld begins to lose its profits as well and they start their own manhunt for the killer assisted by whores beggars and petty thieves With the carefully observing eyes all over town it becomes practically impossible for Becker to satisfy his monstrous needs The almighty Peter Lorre arrives late in the film every moment hes on screen is a moment worth treasuring His sad appearance and cruel testimony are sequences that leave no human being unmoved Lorre is a brilliant actor and this is inarguably one of the most impressive performances of all time M features constant tension outstanding dialogue and stunning camerawork As said before Fritz Lang had the opportunity to work with sound for this film and he immediately makes the most out of this This was the first big German production that featured sound and it STILL ranks as the title that made best use of itand that sure means something after more than  years Theres the chilling and legendary tune Lorre constantly whistles but also the absence of sound Lang uses to portray the besieged city As you can tell from the above review M is absolute mustsee and easily one of the most essential productions ever shot Its lightyears ahead of its time and still disturbing after all these years This film is a mesmerizing portrait about the darkest most alarming aspects of humanity and yet still it doesnt live up to reallife facts As you probably know the plot of M is based on the whereabouts of the serial killer Peter Kürten who brutally murdered many victims in the city of Düsseldorf I read a biography on Kürten recently and the true details of his crimes and animallusts go beyond every filmmakers wildest imagination,10
22,Since I loved Metropolis and was mesmerized by the great storyline of M I happily shelled out  euros to get the deluxe DVDset of Fritz Langs first talkie fully expecting I was going to view it over and over againWell that was  euros I should have spent on a new haircut or something This is a very boring film one that is only somewhat redeemed by a great Peter Lorre and an interesting final scene But the first hour was sooo slooow! Low point was a tenminute scene in which four boring men were having a roundtable about deciding what to do about the child killer No camera movement whatsoever just blabbering and no oneliners either Hes a killer for heavens sake  ACTION! DO SOMETHING! STOP HIM! Looking back maybe I was even more mesmerized by the brand M The film posters are great and that single M just makes for a classic even harrowing logoStill I honestly cant believe that a modern viewer would actually enjoy this,4
23,From the elongated opening scene of M you know you are in for more than a simple film could ever imagine The elongated lunch scene as a mother waits for her daughter to return as we audience members watch the daughter stray from her journey home with a stranger with a sharpened whistle It is foreboding it is depressing it is mesmerizing It has been a very long time since a film especially one made  years ago seemed so delicate so thought provoking so timeless as M does From these opening shots Lang lets us know that this isnt going to be your happy utopia where criminals are caught the next day by the police and our world goes back to liquorish and lollipops but instead a world where the locals collect like a mob and trust is thrown violently out of the window With excellent cinematography and a strong balance between humor and honesty Lang creates this visceral world where the line between truth and justice get blurred where good and evil are similar and a man defines his actions as uncontrollable This merely scratches the surface of M a masterful film that ranks amongst the best this world has offeredWhat makes M shoot ahead of anything modern anything by cult directors anything close to popular? It begins with the actors goes to the man behind the camera and finally the skillful craftsmanship of the story Each of these elements never lack never fall behind and constantly build upon each other until that final breath that encourages you to repetitively rewatch To begin Peter Lorre How could you not talk about M without mentioning this doeeyed murderer From the beginning we know his role in this film yet Lang pulls every emotion out of us as we follow his route We feel sympathy for Lorre when he is tried we feel scared when he is trapped in the attic we feel hatred when he voyeuristically looks at the children  and yet he isnt the only character in this film Lang introduces us to other well placed personas throughout The infamous Inspector Lohmann not to mention that great floorup shot is the perfect example of Langs impressions on the local German police The fact that Lohmann whistles counter productive to what Lorre represents only solidifies that idea To add to these already dynamic people we have the background criminals that decide to take the matter into their own hands in hopes to eliminate the looming police presence The Safecracker is idealistic of what Germany was to become the classic SS look with the idea of eliminating the opportunity to be tried in a true court of law Each one of these characters provide humor excitement and fullblown emotion to the screen adding to the overall impact to this film With Lorre already bedazzling us with his range and taut emotion it is up to Fritz Lang himself to ensure that edits angles and direction doesnt hinder the power of his actors Lang steps up to the plate and delivers with his avantgarde film making I use the words avantgarde because the techniques used in this film are far beyond  Lang incorporates powerful closeups amazing track following and shots nearly unseen at this time The overhead shots the ability to make the crowds look ravenous the camera puns adds just as much as another lead would If you were impressed by his ability in Metropolis M is only going to solidify that idea of Lang A favorite is the raid on the office complex by a group of criminals Every shot every detail is directed with ease but complexity It is easy to be in awe of this film but to take the time to see Langs ability behind the camera will take M to a whole new level Personally it is my belief that he announces himself with this film A pioneer of the camera a grandfather of what cinema is today  one cannot watch anything released today and not see Langs influences See Finchers Zodiac a nearly identical film in themes to what Lang was trying to produce hereFinally we have acting and direction but one must also credit the story for being not just creative and unflinchingly original but for supporting a strong message The idea of being more careful was impressive to watch due to the time being  a time well thought of that children could be anywhere without any worry The story brings evil into an American thought that good guys always prevail that suburbia is always safe and that the police actually do keep the streets safe The story of M challenges you as a viewer even today one could argue even more so today than in  With crimes continually on the rise in this country with the idea that pleading insanity cures the disease of murder or is an easy innocence the idea of M especially that final dialogue seems more important today The fascination also arises with the concept of the mob within this story  the horror that simple events kindness even could turn on anyone in a moment of panic Police arresting anyone that even looks at children in a peculiar way  a fascinating concept that Lang is not afraid to develop Imagine if this film were made two years later what a different theme Lang would have tackledA deeply enticing film Fritz Lang proves that he was a ground breaker in his field Not only could he handle Science Fiction but nearly every other genre imaginable M is no exception to his skill If you have not seen this film watch it  experience it  know what it means to be marked like Lorre Grade ***** out of *****,10
24,Im a fan of Peter Lorres and I love black &amp; white films  I enjoy foreign films  I even like trying to twist my brain around mindboggling symbolfilled convoluted art flicks  But I was incredibly disappointed in *M*It had a lot of potential but it kept drowning in itself  It took me a while to understand this  The plot itself wasnt overly complex  so why did I still have the feeling of unpleasant confusion  What I finally realized is that *M*s downfall is that it cant decide what it isI went into it with a general understanding of what it was going to be about and knowing Peter Lorres work I had certain expectations  The parts of the movie that were most satisfying to me were those which fit those expectations a tense shadowy atmosphere made all the more eerie and suspenseful by the skillful use of In the Hall of Mountain KingOther parts of the movie felt more like a police procedural  There is certainly a place for the Ed McBains of our world but that place is not being mixed in with Robyn Cook  These segments felt out of place and they jarringly interrupted the mood created by the spookier more emotionally taut scenesThe muchapplauded ending had the same problem for me it suddenly introduced yet another mood  that of introspection and social consciousness  This was too distinct from either of the other two moods to feel as if it were even part of the same pictureEach mood each theme each general strain could have been very good on its own  but as a package the film felt illblended  And as much as I enjoy paradox and even confusion they are not in of themselves sufficient criteria for a good film,3
