0,If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend as others have pointed to in the past City Lights is the one Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies like Modern Times and The Gold Rush City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest his bravest his most romantic and his most sympathetic Its tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters but its pulled off The film centers on three characters the Tramp the quintessential funny homeless man who blends into the crowd but gets caught in predicaments He helps a drunken businessman Myers a fine performance in his own right from suicide and becomes his on and off again friend that is when it suits him and doesnt notice his friends state The other person in the Tramps life is the Blind Flower Girl Virginia Cherrill one of the most absorbing beautiful and key female performances in silent film who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money which leads to a how else can I put it magical boxing match where its basically a  from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull Though there is no dialog the film achieves a timelessness its essentially a tale of two loners who find each other lose each other and find each other again the last scene widely discussed by critics for decades is moving if not tearinducing And its never ever boring once you get along with the Tramp you find the little things about him the reaction shots the little things he does after the usual big gag look to the ballroom scene for examples of this or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing Truth be told if this film makes you indifferent never watch Chaplin again But if you give yourself to the film you may find its one of the most charming from the era or perhaps any era,10
1,Let me join the consensus and call Charlie Chaplins City Lights a masterpiece Its only  minutes long but they are among the best  minutes you could spend at the movies and the last five minutes are simply exquisite Keep your Kleenex box at arms length as I doubt if there has been a more honestly heartbreaking scene captured on film When the formerly blind girl gives the Little Tramp a flower and ultimately says Yes I can see now the scene takes on such emotional gravity as to defy explanationChaplin was at his zenith in  when he started a journey of more than two years to develop and film this story and the Little Tramp had already been a familiar character to audiences for over a decade He had already made the classics The Gold Rush  and The Circus  starring his character so its obvious he felt a need to take a slightly different direction and deepen the character this time The advent of talkies didnt stop Chaplin from making this Comedy Romance in Pantomime as he subtitled it as he knew giving the Little Tramp a voice would limit his appeal as a universal character What I particularly enjoyed in this film is how the Little Tramp fancies himself as a wellmannered gentleman in spite of all the circumstances that bring him down even going to prison for love It is this selfdelusion and his subsequent mistaken identity as a millionaire that leads him to the blind flower girl played in an effectively plaintive manner by Virginia Cherrill Her performance is a greatly underrated element in this film as she displays the right amount of vacant innocence to make the last minutes so memorable Simply compare her to the screen test shown of Georgia Hale Chaplins leading lady in The Gold Rush and an obviously more experienced actress than Cherrill as Hale struggles to show the right balance between condescension and beatific revelation when she realizes the Little Tramp is the wealthy gentleman who paid for the restoration of her sightOf course this would not be a Chaplin film without the brilliance of his comedy routines and there is a treasure trove of classic scenes  the rising and lowering of the street elevator the shifting musical chairs scene at the nightclub the mock suicide at the canal and especially the boxing scene which has been imitated by so many lesser filmmakers and was according to the footage included as a DVD extra inspired by an earlier Chaplin short The Champion from  Even a simple moment for example when the Little Tramp mistakes a piece of thread from his vest for a ball of twine is impressive for the sheer delicacy of the moment And special mention needs to go to Chaplins musical score where he beautifully interweaves José Padillas La Violetta as his love themeThe transfer to DVD is very good and the DVD set has plenty of extras though they vary in quality The Serge Bromberg documentary provides an informative supplement to the film and the footage of Chaplin from a Vienna press tour is fascinating since it captures the longforgotten worldwide frenzy he created back then The aforementioned Georgia Hale screen test is a worthwhile addition but runs on a bit too long The minute home movie of Chaplins trip to Bali has a certain anthropological interest but seems rather pointless otherwise Regardless the movie itself is rewarding enough and an exquisite jewel that completely justifies Chaplins reputation as one of the worlds leading filmmakers,10
2,This is my favorite Chaplin film but I dont want that to diminish his other work either MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick and even the largelyneglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone Chaplin didnt make a bad movie and Im not even sure that CL is his best exactly But it IS my favorite if only for the endingThat ending has been the subject of much comment here I think its a masterpiece in a single scene Chaplins little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living breathing human being Its a monument to understated sentimentalityTo me the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid Yes the boxing scene is great and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful but its that ending that makes us all love this movie,0
3,Once again Chaplin plays his famous creation the beloved Tramp The noble Little Fellow meets and falls in love with a blind flower girl She assumes he is wealthy man and offers him a flower which he attentively accepts with his last penny One night by chance he rescues a drunken millionaire from drowning The rich gentleman becomes a generous friend when drunk but doesnt recognize the tramp when sober Chaplin takes the blind girl under his wing and takes flight with the millionaires money to cure her blindness City Lights engaged a true genius in a graceful and touching performance which arouses profound feelings and joy with great simplicity of style and tragic tale Each scene was the result of hardworking detail and planning,9
4,Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights and the results are spectacular The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights and even though Charlies performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant City Lights is so well made that it is one of the very few movies in which the obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked Yes you can clearly see the string holding Chaplin up in the sidesplittingly funny boxing scene but who cares? That is such classic slapstick that little things like that really dont matter Besides lets keep in mind that this movie was made seventy years ago Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk His friendship with the drunken rich guy is hilarious but it also makes a significant comment about the problems of alcohol This is truly a great film which should not be forgotten,10
5,Charlie Chaplins City Lights contains a blend of humor and humanity that make it memorable for everyone who watches it  Although made very much in the oldfashioned silent film tradition much of it is timeless tooAfter a few minutes of slapstick at the beginning Charlies little tramp character makes two acquaintances  He meets a blind girl selling flowers who mistakes him for a rich man and the two become very fond of each other Then he meets a real millionaire who is drunk depressed and about to commit suicide  In a comic scene the tramp persuades the millionaire not to go through with it making himself a devoted friendThe tramp soon learns that there is an operation that could give the girl her sight and tries to think of some way he could help  His scenes with the girl and her grandmother are moving while his determination to help lead him into some comic escapades  his attempt to win money in a boxing match being particularly funny and one of Chaplins best comic pieces Meanwhile when his millionaire friend is drunk he dotes on the tramp but when sober he forgets who the tramp is leading to more amusing scenes and occasional trouble for CharlieAll of the comedy leads up to a finale that is one of the bestremembered scenes in any film  City Lights shows the power of the camera in the hands of a master who without words can move his audience or make them laugh  Anyone who appreciates good cinema should see it at least once,0
6,Film has become a medium that is strongly influenced by nostalgia  Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are  Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation  We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new  In City Lights and other silent works of film a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere  While watching the film I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story the sets the crew; the whole project  While this may not have been the complete reality it felt that way and thus made the film more enjoyable  In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional responseSince film is at its very core a visual medium I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium  I dont use the word basic here in a demeaning sense but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance  Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced but they were and are beautiful  The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic There is a warmth found in City Lights and other Chaplin films The Kid Modern Times that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today  Maybe its just that with simplicity comes honesty and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer,0
7,City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of filmmaking Chaplins last silent film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the mans wealth to make her fall in love with him The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesnt recognize the tramp anymore On top of this the flower girl has to pay  dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forthThe outcome of the movie is to almost all people known It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film The movie itself still is masterpiece more than  years after its release I personally rate this as Chaplins second best I have seen so far My favorite remains The Gold Rush Still this movie gets / stars from me,9
8,I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplins nicest most underappreciated silent movie gems Then I discovered it really wasnt underrated; its rated very high on most critics lists It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this onePart of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that Im a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one Its a romance between Charlies tramp character no name and a blind girl who also had no name in this film Virginia Cherill who played the blind woman and had a wholesome pretty face which I found very attractiveIm not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as talkies were out in full force by  Chaplin was at his best in silent movies anyway and his comedy routines are legendary He gave me a lot of laughs in this film as always and I particularly laughed I love slapstick at the boxing scene Kudos too to Harry Myers as the eccentric millionaireTheres a lot of drama as well as humor in this minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sightComedy romance drama with suffering all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment Its hard to believe this movie was not up for one single Academy Award,9
9,CITY LIGHTS United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  l is a silent comedydrama released at the height of the sound era Distributing a movie in the silent film tradition at the time when silents were considered a fad Chaplin gambled with this production and made it pay off Although Chaplin hails THE GOLD RUSH  as the one movie he would most want to be remembered CITY LIGHTS nearly dims out his GOLD RUSH and at the same time practically places his other silent masterpiece THE CIRCUS  to oblivion CITY LIGHTS has stood the test of time balancing perfectly a mixture of comedy and drama but in Chaplins case pathosSubtitled A comedy romance in pantomime the story opens in the early morning where the mayor is dedicating a statue to the citizens of the city After the unveiling the crowd finds a little tramp Charlie Chaplin sleeping on the lap of one of the figures As he tries to climb down he encounters one problem after another This opening scene alone is priceless With such a great beginning Chaplin adds in more comedic insertions blended into the plot The theme to CITY LIGHTS is remembered mainly about a tramps love for a blind girl However there is a subplot involving the tramps involvement with a millionaire drunk which by far takes up more time than the sentimental love story These two segments actually set the pattern First segment set in the afternoon finds Charlie walking down the street examining a nude statue in a shop being annoyed by some newsboys making fun of his tattered clothing He encounters a beautiful blonde girl Virginia Cherrill selling flowers After she drops one of her flowers Charlie notices her feeling about the sidewalk for it thus realizing shes blind Smitten by her beauty he picks it up and pays her for it Minutes later the slamming of a limousine door is heard with the girl believing the kind gentleman Charlie to be a millionaire Second segment set at night finds Charlie encountering a drunk Harry Myers trying to commit suicide by drowning himself Just as Charlie is about to save him he in turn falls into the river The drunk in gratitude for saving his life takes Charlie under his wing to accompany him to various night clubs until dawn By morning the millionaire now sober fails to recognize or remember Charlie and orders orders his butler to escort this stranger out of his mansion This running gag thats repeated in the story might play itself as repetitious but Chaplin manages to breathe new life and funnier routines through his encounters with the drunk and their all night binges By day Charlie looks after the blind girl and worries when shes not at her usual corner selling flowers Finding that shes ill and being cared by her grandmother Florence Lee whose behind with her rent and threatened with eviction Charlie offers to help by obtaining and losing various jobs ranging from streetcleaning to fighting in a boxing match Reading in a newspaper of a European doctor who restores sight for the blind Charlie gives the girl $ for an operation the money offered to him by the drunken millionaire who after sober accuses Charlie of robbing him has his arrested and serving jail time The climatic finish is truly the best thing Chaplin has ever done and certainly one not to be missedFeatured in the supporting cast are Henry Bergman Allan Garcia Albert Austin and Hank Mann While much has been discussed about Chaplins performance his costar Virginia Cherrill as the blind girl no name given should not go without mention Even though her future film career consisted of forgettable programmers and at one time being one of the future wives of film actor Cary Grant her performance is excellent by all means Although its been said that future film star Jean Harlow  appears as an unbilled extra in the night club sequence she is visible in a surviving still photograph but no such scene appears in the finished product Unlike THE GOLD RUSH CITY LIGHTS had limited showings in revival houses in later years and was never allowed to be distributed to television Being first introduced to CITY LIGHTS at New York Citys revival movie house The Regency Theater formerly located on Broadway and th Street in  the memorable thing about this event are the roars of laughter from its theater packed audience There was one man probably a big fan reliving his childhood memories whose laughter almost drowned out the underscoring of the film No doubt he was having more fun watching this movie than anyone else Watching CITY LIGHTS surrounded by an appreciative audience theater is one way to truly appreciate and experience the feel of silent film comedy and to think back as to how the audience reacted in same back in After Chaplins death in December of  CITY LIGHTS along with his other silent features were not only resurrected for a new generation to endure but became readily available on video cassette at the time of Chaplins th birthday  In later years CITY LIGHTS was frequently revived on various cable channels ranging from Turner Network Television TNT in the early s American Movie Classics up to  and finally Turner Classic Movies The complete musical soundtrack that accompanies CITY LIGHTS happens to be the original score composed to perfection by Chaplin himself Much has been written and said about CITY LIGHTS over the years To learn more about the making difficulties and long term preparations to CITY LIGHTS either watch Kevin Blownlows  documentary Hollywood A Celebration of the American Silent Film as narrated by James Mason or Brownlows other documentaries dedicated entirely to Chaplins career including outtakes to CITY LIGHTS as well as scenes involving Virginia Cherrills temporary replacement Georgia Hale Chaplins costar in THE GOLD RUSH ****,10
10,Spoilers hereinFor me this film falls not into the category of favorite films Im a Marx brothers kind of guy but earns instead a place on a very short list of most important moviesThats because it has two features that I truly appreciateIt is as pure a vision of its creator as is possible Nearly all other films are engineered from prior work Not so with a small list of projects from Welles Kurosawa Eisenstein  and this one project of Chaplins They are wholly original springing from some nether worldBut the other element is the one that impresses the most This film is about itself about the art of visual narrative Chaplin was intelligent enough to know that what he was doing was new The issues are centered on what the audience `sees so while he struggles with what and how the audience sees he builds that into the fabric of the storyThe primary framing is about the blind girl who falls in love with him by `seeing him in her own way Then `sees him at the end in a different way The rich man recognizes the tramp when drunk but does not when he is not Nearly all the jokes indeed every element of the film is about this same dynamic the elevator which is not seen but then was the burglars the same the Tramp on the statue on the barrel Even seeing the cigar before the bum does Even us seeing the soap and the foreman notThe `seeing is carried over to `hearing with the politician and whistle jokes And then even further as Charlie turns his back on the new technology of giving us speech and instead `shows us something else he writes and conducts an amazing score instead This is truly amazing and one reason to take Mike Figgis seriouslyNo wonder Orson Welles considered this the most important film ever made But as to the best to watch? Because film is so derivative my own gold standard for the Tramp is Robert Downeys and to some extent Depps Comic timing is something that evolves and those men make a more effective Tramp for my modern ability to seeTrivia Chaplin found the `blind girl in a group of spectators at a fight and was struck with how her expressions reflected what she saw Shes pretty as well of course but certainly not the prettiest Chaplin knew See how Chaplin separately works in both the fight a performance and her reaction to his performance in the film,0
11,Waddling along with his cane and derby hat and that tiny mustache the little tramp Charles Chaplin is visually unlike any character in film history The tramp is kindhearted always dignified Hes a simple soul who in City Lights tries to help out a young blind woman well played by Virginia Cherrill This is a silent film of course but the tramps body language is his speechThe really noticeable feature of the tramp character is how he blends into everyday life Hes more or less ignored by many laughed at by others The girls grandmother never sees him at all And only when the millionaire is drunk does he see the tramp as a friend Curious  and deepThe tramp gets into his fair share of trouble but only through his bumbling efforts to help the girl The boxing match is a hoot and very well choreographed as are all the skits And what a beginning for a film with city leaders spouting gibberish probably as Chaplins dig at the talkies Then the way Chaplin makes his grand entrance  just terrific!Melancholy at times the films music really tugs at your heartstrings Maybe its sentimental and manipulative But given the abiding and Zenlike qualities of the tramp some sentimentality is quite appropriate And the music is choreographed totally in sync with the plot actionProduction design is sparse and at times drab That the film was made during the Great Depression is beyond obviousComedy here is simple and effective The main character expresses heart and humanity The little tramp is an unforgettable character And City Lights is a wonderful film,10
12,Chaplin was a unique presence in the history of the early cinema  Coming up through the ranks he gradually achieved a godlike stature being awarded total control of every facet of the productionNot only was he often the sole person who knew what the end product was to be as in The Kid but he was also allowed to elaborately improvise in the creative process  This often meant doing countless scores of retakes over days weeks and even months; holding up the cast and crew for days while he brooded over just what to do next; and even in the case of The Gold Rush cancelling expensive weeks of location shooting and returning to the studio to start all over againHe cleverly duped chief studio and bank chiefs into somehow going along with his freewheeling and gross inclinations thus mesmerizing their conservative senses into supporting his hitandmiss schemes and trialanderror madnessIn other words Chaplin used the entire productional company as merely as his paintbrush with which he toyed at his pleasure to create his personal canvases  Fortunately he was a genius and at the right place in time to be allowed to get away with such unprecedented extravagenceIt was a young and growing industry when Chaplin began emerging and there were no set rules  People were still trying to figure out just what could be done with the medium  and Chaplin helped to establish its early parametersHe was certainly and autocrat yet that doesnt really matter when it comes to film works  Its the product that counts  In the case of City Lights all the bloodsweatandtears that it took to achieve the finished product was more than worth the effort  Now that all the frustration anger and outrage associated with the behindthescenes unfoldment of this highly troubled production are well in the past what remains is a genuinely moving film classic,10
13,The victory of the sound picture over the silent was a speedy and decisive one The first fulllength talkies were released in  By  theatres were being forced to convert to sound in order to stay in business By  silent film production by the major studios was completely discontinued and the medium became generally viewed as an anachronism But in  a new silent picture was released that far from being an embarrassing failure became the fourthhighest grossing picture of the year being even more popular than such classics as the Bela Lugosi Dracula and The Public Enemy The picture was City Lights and its producer writer director editor composer and star was Mr Charlie ChaplinChaplin was of course primarily a comedian and his humour was of broad appeal but audiences of the time were not exactly starved of easy comedy The Marx Brothers were making great strides on the verbal quipping front and the everpopular Laurel and Hardy had made a successful transition to sound What makes Charlie stand out and what gave him a level of accessibility that allowed him to continue with his slapstick antics well into the sound era is his equal devotion to story which allowed him a scope for social commentary empathetic characterisation and deep poignancy Of all Chaplins silent pictures City Lights is probably his least memorable in the funny stakes The number of classic gags here is fairly small Not since The Kid a decade earlier has Chaplin given story so much precedence City Lights is riddled with coincidence and plot contrivance but its a tale of such beauty and sincerity that this does not matter Within this story the comedy becomes functional often serving to puncture a schmaltzy moment before it becomes overdone Ironically it is the occasional forays into slapstick that help keep City Lights realAs if to snub the talkie City Lights is a remarkable achievement in complex visual narrative even only occasionally relying upon title cards and then often only as an embellishment to the more comedydriven moments Most plot points and character traits are implied rather than stated which gives the picture a continual smoothness – another thing that would have gone down well with audiences glad to see the back of the intrusive title card Out of necessity Chaplins technical approach is more overt than his usual He often cuts to a closeup to give us a necessary reaction and there are even some whippans in the scene where he and the flower girl first meet but all of this is in keeping with the rhythm and tone of the picture Those whip pans after all reflect an abrupt emotional moment and are in no way a blatant or showy manoeuvreBut what really makes City Lights work what makes it connect is the man himself on the screen Those additional closeups once a rarity for a man who acted mainly with his body now show off a capability for intense facial acting An older more meditative Chaplin may have been keeping the traditions of silent cinema alive but his own career trajectory was entering new ground where emotional expression was increasingly intimate and personal The result is profoundly moving,10
14,City Lights is a different film from what I am used to seeing I have not watched a Silent film or pantomime in a few years I really enjoyed the story that Charles Chaplin helped to create and produce for our enjoyment The plot seems to be commonly used now with a boy falling in love and trying to win the girls love in return In City Lights there are a few twists to the plot The girl is blind and poor the TrampChaplinis poor in love and wants to help the blind girl The Millionaire can help the tramp out by giving him money but he is an onagain offagain friend depending on whether or not he is drunkBeing that this is a silent film there is more importance on the use of props and the acting of the character Since in a silent film they cant tell us how they are feeling it is important that we can understand feelings through action This may be through facial expressions body language dress eye contact kinds of touch or the use of written statements like title cards in a silent film A prop that stood out to me was the use of flowers From the flower girl selling her flowers to how Chaplin was always holding or smelling one of the flowers from his special girl the use of flowers helped show the emotions and feelings of the two characters It symbolized the affection he had for her because like the flowers she couldnt see she couldnt see the true him or his true affections Another prop that was used was money From the millionaires point of view money was really of no matter He threw a party just because he had been reunited with his friend he went out to the dance club and when Chaplin needed money in order to help the flower girl pay for rent and surgery he was willing to give him one thousand dollars To the millionaire this money is nothing but to Chaplin and the flower girl this is a showing forth of love and charity When the movie was made in the s many people were poor and hopeless but the portrayal of Chaplin as a poor but happy and hopeful man might have given hope to others who watched this movie during the Depression In the film I noticed the use of a repetition or rather a parallelism as was read in the Film Art book dealing with The Wizard of Oz They show shots one way in Kansas and then reverse the shot in Oz as I saw in City Lights In City Lights parallelism is done with sight not necessarily with eyes but with the mind We see the reverse where the poor blind girl sees Chaplin as a millionaire and then at the end she sees him as the tramp he is with her new eyesight The true reverse is emphasized because she is now working in a shop and making money The two characters are somehow always at perceived opposite ends of the social class spectrum yet he still has a desire for her to be happy because of his love Another reverse is the happy friendly drunk millionaire who sees Chaplin as his friend and hero for stopping him from committing suicide However when he is sober he wants nothing to do with him throws him out and even has him arrestedIn a way this film is different then what our generation might be used to but by watching these classics we can better learn where the movies we love today came from and gain a better appreciation for the art of film,7
15,The tramp tries to nurture and help a blind flower girl regain sight despite scant resources and the prejudices and graft of the big city Although the physical gags lack the largescale invention of the factory scenes in Modern Times and the criticism of the wealthy doesnt transcend an admittedly witty recurring jokethe aristocrat friend can only demonstrate compassion and friendliness in an inebriated state; hes always inviting the tramp in only to incredulously throw him out the next sober morningthe tramps touching earnestness in rescuing his angel from a life of abjection is simple and selfless and deeply moving I would say it also fades out at the perfect moment of openended ambiguitythe viewer is forced to make resonant meaning out of the final troublingly cathartic shot even as the film articulates a consistent worldview in relation to what has come before In my eyes Modern Times is Chaplins masterpiece but City Lights would probably better merit repeat viewings which is as much a testament to the films power as anything else,8
16,City Lights is probably one of the most well loved along with Modern Times Chaplin movies The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp one of the most lovable truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps like they are labeled lazy and troublesome It is very hard to hate The Tramp because he gives so much when he has so little He spends his time and money giving to people  whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl Undoubtedly we all have a little bit of The Tramp in usThe plot is as follows the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street She is poor and by a mere coincidence believes that The Tramp is rich He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide and despite his gratefulness doesnt remember the poor tramp unless he is drunkCity Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history Its poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy I believe it is a strong mixture of both and a great balance of the two Both comedic and touching City Lights should not be missed by anyone,8
17, its perhaps a test of a persons outlook to ask them what they see in the final scene If theyve never seen City Lights before and they instantly notice the major continuity issue Chaplin holds a flower to his lapel from the rear shot its up to his mouth on his close up then maybe theyve placed film studies over romanceIt took a few viewings before I spotted this and once I did I cant help but notice it Yet even despite this I never fail to get choked up on the beauty of that final scene If you want to impress the right kind of girl put it on and show her what a sensitive soul you are during those final momentsAs for the rest of the film then while the final five minutes are classic and perhaps the best thing Chaplin ever did the rest of it is episodic and patchy necessitating my relatively low score Still a fine film but never a completely great one what presages those beautiful final moments is merely fine entertainment,7
18,If i have to choose which movie have the best ending it is very easy to choose city lights it is very very easy Chaplin was genius seriously genius This is the movie that truly inspire me After i watch city lights i just know there is such a movie power that exist in this world that can move and touch me really deep I never feel such a sharp sensation ever from any hundred movies i watch before and this movie pierce me through the heart within silent only gesture eye contact and cameraworks with no dialoguesometimes i try to analyze deeply why this movie have such a magnificent power i think the reason is the connection between scenes if we ask ourself what makes a good ending ? maybe the answer is how good you make the scene before the ending how good you correlate the prologue and epilogue and also between them how you fill the midduration of a movie if the director took a right decision a movie will not have any wasted scenes its only genius filmmaker can do and chaplin is one of themsilent movie such as city light is a hardkind of movie to made it needs next level of acting skill from the actors and actresses because there are no dialogue in it and most of the duration this movie is flawless in casting and the ending scene were unbelievable and unpredictable maximum genuine artbeauty of silent moviei recommend everybody to watch this movie at least once this movie is special it definitely will pierce you,10
19,As always the little tramp is fleeing the long arm of the law when he is mistaken for a wealthy man by a blind girl selling flowers by the roadside While he longs to help her the tramp knows he cannot However when he is at his lowest he stumbles upon a drunken man who he helps out who may be able to help him in turn  if the two of them can sober up long enoughIn response to seeing some modern trash posing as comedies recently Little Man Norbit Pluto Nash  Im looking at you I decided to check out some comedies that have stood the test of time  a few Chaplin films being among them City Lights is one of those film that you will think you have seen even when you have not I knew I had never actually seen it but the wonderful opening scene on the statue and the scenario of the blind girl by the side of the road were very familiar to me and I was right into it from the start As was often the case this film has a thin narrative but one that allows for several scenarios for Chaplin to work his magic And so he does with some classic sequences across the whole filmThe statue scene is memorable for how he makes so much out of so little but the brilliant choreography of the boxing match had me rolling with laughter as it moved so beautifully and imaginatively around the ring Chaplin is a master and this is just one of many films that shows it as he creates a great little clown that we care about but can also laugh at His support do no more than that  support him  but yet they are also roundly good Cherrill provides attractive heart despite her simple character while Myers Garcia Mann and a few others do good physical work alongside ChaplinCity Lights is a really great film that is all the more impressive for still feeling fresh and funny more than seventy years after it was made The simple narrative is the frame but it is the wonderful and frequent setpieces that tickle and also stick in the mind So tonight you might be looking at your film queue with lots of modern comedies but it is worth bumping this classic to the top of the list instead,0
20,Do you really need to post a spoiler warning for a movie that as of tonight is  years old?I havent read other reviews so forgive me if I repeat any previous postings City Lights is with nary a doubt the greatest love story ever told Forget Casablanca Forget An Affair to Remember Forget Love Story For the love of Christ forget Love Story This is a movie about the purest loveWe have the simple ubiquitous Tramp He is smitten with a blind flower girl who has mistaken him for a wealthy man There is a new operation that cures blindness and the Tramp will do anything to help Flower Girl regain her sight He tries to win a boxing match in which he is clearly outclassed In an era that is forgotten in modern times pun gleefully intended he cleans the streets of dung One of the best sight gags in screen history happens when the Tramp has to clean up after an elephant Finally he steals from a wealthy man to get the money he needs to pay for Flower Girls operationAnd then after he has spent many years in prison the Tramp is reunited with Flower GirlMy fellow males this is a wonderful Chick Flick If your lady friend isnt reduced to tears by the last  minutes of this movie you need to find a new lady Ive seen it a dozen times and it always gets to me,0
21,Four years into sound Charlie Chaplin wrote performed directed and scored one of films finest masterpiecesThe story is about the Little Tramp befriending a blind woman who mistakenly thinks he is rich Along the way he manages to get into a series of unintentional fixes with a large cast of foils at his disposal as he struggles to finance an operation for the womanIn an incredible display of comic talent Chaplin bombards the audience with scene after scene of magnificently choreographed comedy Drunk dancing or boxing his graceful slapstick is a rare combination of comedy and beauty a comic ballet Chaplins performing artistry as well as his ideas reach their apex with City Lights where only Chaplin would dare to challenge the naturally progressive trend and technological status quo by daring to make a silent By pulling it off with aplomb he solidified his place atop the history of the profession Some sound is used sparingly brilliantly with a statue dedication and a piano keyboard but no intelligible words are uttered The track and Chaplins score is lyrical energized and integral The film is perfectly constructedIn the masterful hands of Chaplin he avoids bathos in his scenes with the blind woman by severing the sentimentality and the scene with a comic moment saving it all for the incredibly touching and moving finale Up until then it is a display of comic genius that only a handful of others might lay claim to,10
22,As much as I loved The Kid The Gold Rush Modern Times and The Great Dictator City Lights is the film I consider Charlie Chaplins masterpiece And there are several reasons why this is so for meI love how City Lights is filmed once again the cinematography is stunning as are the costumes and sets The music is also a delightthough my favourite soundtrack in a Chaplin movie is the one for Modern Times with plenty of themes that stuck in my head while the sound effects are wonderfully incorporated and the subtitles easy to understand The comedy is brilliantly done the scene in the boxing ring is not only one of my favourite scenes in a Chaplin moviealong with the final sequence and the dance of the bread rolls of The Gold Rush the final scene of The Kid and the speech from The Great Dictator but ever in a comedy while there is a very touching love story between the Tramp and the little blind girlplayed touchingly by Virginia Cherrill he falls in love with And I also found the closeup climax achingly poignant because of its beauty and ambiguity Chaplin is superb his pantomime skills and physical humour are extremely well judged and he is acts beautifully with CherrillOverall yet another Chaplin masterpiece yet for me this is the best of them all / Bethany Cox,10
23,Charlie Chaplin made some extremely funny shorts but of his longer films this is one of the best along with The Gold Rush and Modern Times Two stories are woven together One is Charlies onagain offagain friendship with a wealthy drunk The guy has a case of multiple personality When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts When hes sober he doesnt recognize Charlie at allThe second story involves a pretty blind flower girl who given certain distances angles and lighting resembles Uma Thurman Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballsCharlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy hes sober and wont support Charlies story Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel broke and bitter he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands The happy endingTheres sentimentality in the story of course There often is in Chaplins later films But as usual its somehow tempered Here its undercut by ironyWhen Charlie meets the wealthy toff the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope Hes about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes gives him a pep talk and changes his mind His spirit revived the rich guy spread his arms to the sky dropping the boulder that falls on Charlies footAnd when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl shes enthralled by his gentleness Unseen by her the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain himself enraptured Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlies face Well its not the blind Mr Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W C Fields general store but what is? A note There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film not counting the DempseyTunney debacle but I dont think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed hereIts hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this Black and white and silent Applause please,8
24,City Lights  **** out of Charlie Chaplin returns as The Tramp and this time he falls in love with a blind girl Virginia Cherrill and sets out to help her The Tramp eventually meets a suicidal drunk Harry Myers and their friendship leads to what might eventually help the girl he lovesChaplin made great films before and after CITY LIGHTS but for my money this here is his greatest film as well as one of the greatest films ever made Not only is it one of the funniest movies ever made but Id also argue that its one of the greatest love stories if not the greatest It really says a lot when a movie can conqueror two genres at one time but CITY LIGHTS is simply one of the greatest movies ever madeI think it says a lot that you get one classic scene after another and theres really not a weak spot to be found here Being  it took some real guts for Chaplin to deliver a silent film and I think he knew that he had to deliver something special because people had moved onto sound He certainly delivered something special as this here was easily the funniest film he had made up to this point The opening sequence with the introduction of The Tramp was priceless and we got one hilarious scene after another from that point The scenes with the drunk are downright hilarious as is another scene where The Tramp is trying to eat but without much success The cigar sequence is a masterpiece as is the by the water In fact the story between The Tramp and the drunk would have made a terrific movie on its own Just like the stuff with The Tramp and the blind girl would have made a perfect film Whats so special is that you get both stories wrapped up in one and it really deliversChaplin played The Tramp countless times but he was never better than he is here Just check out the timing in countless scenes including the boxing match and you cant help but be impressed with the actor Myers also deserves a lot of credit as the drunk as his timing has to match that of Chaplin throughout and the two men do a wonderful job together Then youve got Cherrill who wasnt a professional actor but the director makes her shine throughoutCITY LIGHTS contains one great scene after another and all of the laughs lead up to one of the most powerful endings in film history Theres really not enough great things that can be said about this film as it continues to get better with each passing year,0
