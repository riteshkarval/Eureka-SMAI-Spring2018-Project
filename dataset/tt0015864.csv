0,The Gold Rush is one of Chaplins best films as well as one of his most famous It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by and its not hard to see why Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector a young miner during the gold rush After getting caught in a storm he hurries to the only shelter that he can find a wood cabin in the middle of the storm It turns out that it is already inhabited and by a tough criminal named Black Larson no less and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim another prospector insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film,10
1,The Gold Rush is pure gold  It was Charlie Chaplins third featurelength film and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris  which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp  This movie should be counted among Chaplins best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights which Ive also seen as THE best Chaplin movie but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedys immortal geniusesHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV I saw it again in October  as part of my colleges silentfilm class on a poorquality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen ,10
2,Charles Chaplins The Gold Rush is arguably his finest film He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich What he does not realize is that he may find love in the form of Georgia Hale instead of money In the end that may be all right with him The Gold Rush shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer writer and director he was Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the th Century Chaplin showed humanity love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career The movie is exceptional in every way Although I am not as wellversed with movies from the s as I am with the decades following it I would still probably call The Gold Rush the finest film of that year period Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today  stars out of ,0
3,The  Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious As an unnamed prospector Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner the dancing roles and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff His companion Big Jim McKay Mack Swain at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplins character to be a chicken and before long a bear enters their cabin In the midst of it all the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia Georgia HaleA real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!,10
4,To see Charlie Chaplins The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment One cannot help but enjoy a film as welldone as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered and I can see why It is a masterful blend of comedy drama and romance among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture Like all great movies The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramps flawless physical comedy He was a master of comedic timing and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians Ive ever seen Dont get me wrong this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler The film moves along at a brisk pace following the misadventures of our hero The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin of course as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska Along his journey through the elements the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen Tom Murray a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold Fortunately our friend also comes across a fellow prospector Big Jim McKay Mack Swain who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich But the Lone Prospectors adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere When he is forced back to civilization he falls in love with Georgia Georgia Hale the most beautiful girl in town Of course it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite the handsome ladys man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia as well Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the egomaniacal lady killer All of this would be too much for any one of us but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie I am a fan of Charlie Chaplins movies but as objective as I can possibly be this IS one of the great moviesEssential viewing!,10
5,This silent classic has many strong points  it has a lot of humor interesting characters a good story and good settings  Its the kind of film that shows how much a master filmmaker can communicate in a silent movie  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion but other than that its a fine filmChaplin himself plays the Lone Prospector and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors rickety cabins plus some other good materialThe version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin reedited in the s adding his own narration and deleting the title cards which gives it a slightly different feel  These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who arent used to silent films You can tell from Chaplins narration how fond he must have been of The Gold Rush and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art,0
6,Charlie Chaplins silent film also rereleased with a narration in the early s focuses as usual on the Little Tramp and in this case his attraction to a chorus girl Georgia Hale This is the one where he eats a boot along with its laces and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rollsThe role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin Lita Grey but her pregnancy ruled her out Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions Mack Swain appears as Big Jim who shares a cabin with the Tramp at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and goldrunners as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time as a sound film it is fairly good,8
7,Ive seen both version of this filmthe original silent version from  and the rerelease by Chaplin in the s The difference is that the rerelease was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies To do this title cards were removedhaving Chaplin narrate the film In addition Chaplincreated music for the most partsome were classical pieces sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVDit has both plus excellent DVD extras Otherwise there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out theremany with terrible quality prints or music or both The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the  rereleaseI use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film though I might in the future use it for my Psychology classes as well I teach both because Chaplins genius came from his obsessivecompulsive nature The movie reportedly had  times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than  takes!! The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century Along the way he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb Suffice to say the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch something not true of all fulllength slapstick comediessometimes their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to fulllengthThis is a gorgeous wellexecuted piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac The musical score arranged by Chaplin direction acting and cinematography all are simply perfectmaking this in my opinion the best fulllength silent comedy ever made This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keatons films!,10
8,If any single figure can fairly be said to symbolize the glory years of the silent filmsthe cinemas truly international epochit is Charles Chaplins indomitable tramp The Little Fellow as millions came to call him was at once tatty and debonair browbeaten and irrepressibly optimisticand he was without question the bestloved international star in all of film history His coat was too small his pants too large his mustache patently falseand the resultant silhouette instantly recognizable wherever movies were shown Charlie Chaplins tramp spoke to all walks of lifeand never more eloquently than in such silent films as The Kid and The Gold Rush The Gold Rush is superb It deals with Charlies adventures to win the affection of a local dancehall girl and his hilarious efforts to avoid being eaten by bears and by prospectors who are bigger and hungrier than he The most memorable scene is one in which he dines on an old shoe Chaplins exquisite grace turned the boiled shoe into a gourmet feast he carves it carefully smacks his lips in anticipation and then eats it with gusto and appreciation sucking the nails as if they contained the most juices and twirling the laces around his fork as if they were spaghetti,10
9,In Charles Chaplins  film The Gold Rush a lone prospector travels to California looking for gold and entwines himself in adventures and finds Georgia the woman of his dreams After many hardships including a relocating cabin the lone prospector played by Charles Chaplin finds gold and becomes rich ending in success and unity with Georgia The time period in which this movie was shot compared with the technological innovation and the state of the art filming techniques give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel The use of upclose shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a new feel to the style of silent cinema The scene with the cabin shifting and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin was one of the many stylistic filming techniques that gave The Gold Rush such artistic and ingenious appeal Chaplins ideas and his vision that he brought to life in the movie The Gold Rush make it a great landmark in the beginning of silent films and in film history The intricate but simple story of The Gold Rush brought about many distinct feelings when viewing It gives feelings of happiness during scenes where there is comedic relief and slapstick comedy and also can bring about sadness or pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Years but she never shows up It reveals how silent films can become in touch with a persons feelings making them feel for the protagonist without having to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot These aspects of The Gold Rush make it a milestone in the film industry of the modern world,9
10,One of the best Chaplin movies which means one of the best movies ever made Good structure and a lot of  excellent classic scenes such as `Eating the shoe and `The Roll Dance Both the original version and the second release have their own charm,10
11,Charlie Chaplin is the Lone Prospector who goes to Klondike Alaska in search of goldThere he meets and falls in love to beautiful Georgia Georgia HaleIn cold and snowy Alaska he rambles forward looking for gold with his fellow prospector Big Jim McKay Mack Swain thinking of herA genius called Charlie Chaplin made in  this silent movie masterpiece known as The Gold RushNow nearly  years after the film was made we get to watch this genius in a tramp suit doing his jobAnd he did it wellBetter than probably anybodyHe could make us laugh and he could make us cryMaybe even both of those at the same timeChaplin realized that every good comedy has a little tragedy Of course I have to give credits to other actors as wellMack Swain as Big Jim McKay is not only a big man hes also big at his acting skills Georgia Hale is as beautiful of woman as she is a great actress The Gold Rush is filled with marvelous scenesThe most memorable is the shoeeating sceneChaplin on the dance floor is also something to rememberThrough the movie you can hear the score Chaplin composed to this movieIt works perfectlyJust like the whole movieIts pure gold from the beginning till the end,0
12,We follow the little fellow Chaplin in his trip to Alaska to find gold  which he ends up succeeding in finding love at the same time The first half of the movie reunites Chaplin another lonesome gold seeker and a moralless scoundrel in a shelter under a particularly horrendous snowstorm There happens one of the most memorable scene of the movie Big Jims delusion that Chaplins is a giant of course bearing Chaplins manners chicken and his desperate attempts to eat him; but Chaplin is saved by a bear showing up which they finally eat Then parting their ways begins the second half of the movie the onesided romance with the beautiful Georgia met in a dance hall How funny was the scene when she invited out of despair our little fellow to dance to avoid dancing with an invading Jake! How genius showed Chaplin to use TchaykovskysBeauy &amp; the Beasts waltz! Bringing to tear and laughters at the same time As Georgia plays nastily and mocks and fools Chaplin with her friends and secretly discovers his love her heart swings But Chaplin is taken away by his former colleague Big Jim to become millionaires ie find gold And they find it! All ends well as the little fellow &amp; big Jim now millionaires leave on a ship While dressed poorly as in his earlier gold seeker day for a photography he falls upon Georgia who indisputably is happy to be with him and even more happy to find him multimillionaires as she hears from the ship crew The moral? Women love damned $$$,10
13,All the best Chaplin films have one unique scene thats very memorable because its either very funny or very touching In this film its one of the funny onesYou see in this film Chaplin jumps on the band wagon to Alaska to participate in the Gold Rush Along the way he runs into some crazy characters and has to stay out in the middle of nowhere with one of them Since they must try to survive in the cold weather Chaplin decides to cook dinner What he cooks and how they eat it is the priceless joke that makes this film so greatIts not just that one joke though there are tons of laughs in this great movie So I highly recommend it for any fan of silent films or comedies Youll have a lot of fun watching itAs of now this is the earliest Charlie Chaplin film that Ive seen but it probably wont be for long I think hes one of the greatest directors and I hope to see more of his films soon,10
14,THE GOLD RUSH United Artists  written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations So proud of his achievement Chaplin reissued this silent film in  with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself eliminating the use of title cards Then in the summer of  THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting stations week series of The Silent Years as hosted by Orson Welles from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William PerryTHE GOLD RUSH which is set in the turn of the century opens with The Lone Prospector Charlie Chaplin coming to Alaska A snow storm drives him into the cabin of Black Lawson Tom Murray an outlaw Big Jim McKay Mack Swain another prospector who has found gold on his claim is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin After much struggle Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests Stranded due to the heavy storm Larson finds himself chosen to go out for help While out in the storm he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him He gets away by stealing their dog sled but is later killed in an avalanche Back to the cabin Charlie and Larson almost in near starvation eventually make a meal out of a large bear When the snow storm finally subsides the two men go about their separate ways Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia Georgia Hale a dance hall girl causing jealousy from her suitor Jack Cameron Malcolm Waite As for Jim he has forgotten where his gold claim is and locates Charlie to help him find it separating him from Georgia The results that follow is classic ChaplinAside from a large list of supporting players which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis The Gold Rush contains many now classic comedy supplements including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlies encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement There are tender moments too including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Years Eve dinner with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for themWith THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplins most revived and discussed movie one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed including THE CIRCUS  CITY LIGHTS  MODERN TIMES  and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR  Since the advent of home video in the early s THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores ranging from the use of piano organ or orchestra There are even some editions that have no music track at all along with some copies running different time lengths and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout The  reissue being a shorter print with Chaplins narration not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics but can also be found on Chaplins th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a  comedy short PAY DAY Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection But in spite of numerous editions THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics  and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter  reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector avid lip readers will notice that he is called Charlie by his supporting players especially by Georgia ****,10
15,If anyone doubts that Charlie Chaplin was one of the funniest comedians ever or that silent films did not require acting ability t you a commend this film as well as City Lights  Modern Times isnt strictly speaking a silent film although Chaplin had no dialogue there  The Gold Rush while not Chaplins best film does feature his best performance and has so many classic bits it must be seen  Excellent film   version redone by Chaplin is a bit better but either will do  Most highly recommended,10
16,To be perfectly honest I wish I could denounce Chaplin more fervently than I find myself able to Right down to my fundamental worldview I am a Buster Keaton person the face a mask that stoically accepts the door slamming shut; so I find it beyond irksome and trite every time the tramp is by some miraculous chain of events restored into happiness The world as I understand it just doesnt work this way; kings and beggars alike have the same toll to pay So wishing it did only fosters more painThis is actually worst than The Kid in this respect Our lowly hero eventually gets the dream girl but only after he has allowed himself to be dragged in pursuit of gold Oh though filthy rich at that point when in the end he falls practically in the girls arms he is again dressed like a tramp  meaning no doubt he is still the same person  but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul here he gets both There is not even the thought of a compromiseYet I cant help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplins cosmology; the mysterious elusive fates  seemingly random but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose  that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocksNowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside the reality thought to be known understood domesticated into order but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void So every step inside taken casually without much thought is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death Blissful ignorance the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabinIt is a powerful cosmologic symbol what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life With both gold and love impossible love with the dream girl as the chimeras that trick the mindSo Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside but either cannot properly understand – and confuses karma for providential fate  or he does is terrified and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy taleSo however wellmeant its a dishonest patronizing vision of bliss Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging but eventually benevolent whims of providence Its all made right again more than rightNotice how well integrated is this notion inside the film proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the pointofview of the tramp who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger souldefining mechanisms that shape his life that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lessonSo instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill just wait and itll all work out in the end It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the filmSure it is occasionally very funny inventive But were talking here about the more intricate mechanisms that drive a film  and film aspiring to be a truthful reflection of life life itself,0
17,This is the first silent film I have ever seen so I really was not use to having absolutely no sound other than the piano in the background in a  minute movie So it was neat to see the actors using over exaggerated expressions to get their feelings/ideas acrossI felt like they did some of same gags over and over again like someone getting chased around the cabin or The Lonely Prospector burning himself on the stove It just got really old to me quickly I dont know maybe because Im from a different time period and way life but the film just didnt do anything for me I didnt really like the plot of the movie and thought it was a little too spread out and could have had the same effect if it was only  to  minutes long and nothing would have been lost,3
18,Make them laugh make them laugh The American comic tradition and American movies were made for each other Gold Rush is one example that Charlie Chaplin was the father of American comedy Even though Chaplin loves to press political economical or social messages in his films The Gold Rush remains true to its genre It is a comedy non the less Even at the end of the film when THE TRAMP receives a kiss Chaplin reminds the audience that she has ruined the picture with the kiss This is suppose to be a comedy!,9
19,Spoilers hereinI consider `City Lights to be a masterwork one of the films that every literate person must see This film is often equally celebrated but it seems to be a random collection of integrated ideas to me Some work most dontThe  rescore and voiceover is much tighter visually but sonicly heavy If you have a chance with the DVD see it in the  recut with no sound and subtitlesThe one skit that works the best is the famous dancing rolls bit You really must see three versions of this one after another Look at the original Then see the Robert Downey Jr version done in  almost  years later Notice how much more comic Downeys is because he uses a different timing and is both doing it and referencing the Chaplin dance Then see the Johnny Depp version of the year later which pokes fun at the Downey version and reannotates the original A work of genius overlain on a masterpieceOtherwise there are better silent comedies to see And better ChaplinTeds Evaluation   of  Has some interesting elements,0
20,The Gold Rush is a showcase of sorts for Chaplin In it he provides audiences with a wide range of cinematic elements from his signature slapstick routines to dramatic relationships The rags to riches plot was interesting and witty but felt dragged out While Chaplin is good at emotionally engaging the audience with relateable situations like getting stood up or competing for a woman the lack of serious conflict makes the film seem simple The special effects were handled nicely even by todays standards but the true enjoyment in the film comes from watching the tramp endure hardship as he accidentally progresses into wealthiness and sees his life fall together by favorable coincidence,6
21,Spoiler AlertThe Gold Rush is perhaps one of the best silent movies I have ever seenAlthough it takes a bit to get used to silent movie language youll be rewarded with a marvelousfunny and poignant movieSome of the scenes are hilarious and some really touches your heartstrings Chaplin as performer gives one of his best performances in this movie There are plenty of great scenesChaplin and Mack Swain in the cabincrazy with hunger and cabin feverthe touching New Years Eve party and finally the hilarious finale with the cabin out on the edge of a cliffThe later version which was released with added narration and music wasnt as good as the originalbut easier for modern audiences to watch,8
22,What a delightful film I can see the imagination bursting on the screen in riches Each scene contains surprises and bits of magic I love how the film shows visually that the liquid is alcohol and how the cabin ended up on the edge of a cliff This masterpiece is not just a comedy but there are parts that make me laugh just thinking about them like the eating shoe scene fighting over rifle while Chaplin tries to hide from gun and when the cabin is tipping over the cliff scene When the Lone Prospector finds Georgia the film unveils some truly touching dramatic moments I love the image of Chaplin standing still outside his open door listening to the crowd on New Years Eve knowing that he was stoodup I genuinely felt for him Chaplin is a auteur who can make me laugh and cry at the same time Brilliant,10
23,The primitive production values the decrepitlooking camera work and the silent soundtrack with only musical scores to suffice for the lack of the talkie in that era does little to ruin the viewers chance of being entertained by this highly enjoyable classic masterpiece by Charlie Chaplin The Little Tramp finds himself in the Yukon braving the wintery elements bears and a psychopath all for the sake of claiming his own fortune of gold Under his expert direction Chaplin guides THE GOLD RUSH with painstaking detail of what life would be like to live in the freezing extremes having to shack up in a  cabin in danger of toppling over a snowcapped cliff and feasting on shoes for protein Amidst all the atrocities Chaplin being that likeable underdog that everybody roots for and loves overcomes the odds managing to make the best out of a bad read terrible situation He even takes the time to humor himself and a few ladies with a songanddance number involving two forks and a pair of potatoes,0
24,The eternal question for many Chaplin fans is is The Gold Rush better than City Lights?  There are some who would argue for Modern Times or maybe even The Great Dictator  There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramps world City Lights falls short  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what Charlot has been all about all along It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplins works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime  out of ,10
