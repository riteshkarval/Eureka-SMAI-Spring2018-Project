0,This film shows the best of the American cinema Whether we like the film or not one has to recognize the greatest achievement perhaps of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry Gone with the Wind represents a monumental leap as well as a departure for the movies as they were done prior to this filmThe vision of David O Selznick the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchells massive account about the South before and after the Civil War pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the warGone with the Wind brought together the best people in Hollywood The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen Of course credit must be due to the director Victor Fleming and his vision as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard who gave the right tone to the film The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movieOne cant conceive another Scarlett OHara played by no one but Vivien Leigh Her beauty her sense of timing her intelligent approach to this role makes this a hallmark performance Ms Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows Scarlett goes from riches to rags back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didnt know she possessed Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her RhettThe same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie This is a mans man Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency His love for Scarlett the woman he knows is in love with a dream speaks eloquently for itselfThe other two principals Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard give performances that are amazing to watch Ms de Havillands Melanie Hamilton is perfect Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley Mr Howards Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife while Scarlett keeps tempting himThe rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful Ms McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing This huge talent is a joy to watchComments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie but being realistic this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities such as the slavery were the norm of the land While those things are repugnant to acknowledge in the film they are kept at a minimum After all this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South Margaret Mitchell who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American historyEnjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor,10
1,Before I ever saw Gone With the Wind I was well acquainted with Max Steiners theme It opened WOR TVs Million Dollar Movie before every broadcast in New York in the Fifties and Sixties When my parents took me to see Gone With the Wind in one of MGMs rereleases as the film music started in my youthful eagerness to show off my knowledge I remarked to all who could hear that that was stolen from Million Dollar MovieMillion Dollar Movie is gone now but Gone With the Wind book and film remain eternal In these days Margaret Mitchells southern point of view book might have trouble finding a publisher let alone selling film rights to the story But it is a tribute to her and the characters she created that they remain alive in everyones mind who reads the novel or sees the film And thats just about the same because I cant think of another film that remained so faithful to the textIt is said that Margaret Mitchell wrote the book with Clark Gable in mind as Rhett Butler As the sober and ever realistic but charming Rhett Gable for most of the film is playing a character not to dissimilar from what he usually played on screen However in the last half hour of the film when hes hit with unbelievable tragedy and he edges to the point of madness Gable reached dimensions he never did before or subsequently If Mitchell knew who she wanted as Rhett nobody knew who would be Scarlett The search for Scarlett OHara is one of those Hollywood legends as every actress with the possible exception of Edna May Oliver read for the part Gone With the Wind started filming without a Scarlett as the famous burning of Atlanta sequence was done first While it was being down David O Selznick settled on a fairly unknown British actress at least in the USA Vivien LeighIt was a stroke of casting genius Vivien Leighs screen output is pretty small she was primarily a stage actress Gone With the Wind is more her film than Rhett Butlers The story is her story how she evolved from a flighty young southern belle to a hardbitten woman who is determined to survive in the style of living shes become accustomed to from the preCivil War era In the process she helps all those around her economically but loses all their previous affection Ive always felt the key scene in the film is after Leslie Howard tells Leigh hell be marrying Olivia DeHavilland and Leigh makes a fool of herself with him she finds out that Clark Gable has overheard the whole thing Hes fascinated by her but because of that hes on to all her ploysLeslie Howard usually comes in for the smallest amount of analysis among the four leads His Ashley Wilkes is not all that different from Alan Squire in The Petrified Forest Imagine Squire as a wealthy plantation owner and youve Ashley Hes stronger than he realizes though hes the one that reluctantly enlists in the Confederate Army while the cynical Rhett Butler makes some big bucks as a blockade runnerIve always felt however that the most difficult acting job in Gone With the Wind was the role of Melanie Hamilton Olivia DeHavilland after initially considering trying out for Scarlett decided to go after Melanie Its a deceptive part superficially its a lot like the crinoline heroines DeHavilland was doing at Warner Brothers Melanie is the counterpoint to Scarlett an incredibly kind and decent soul who cant see bad in anyone One of her best scenes is with Ona Munson who is Belle Watling the most prominent madam in Atlanta The other women of society snub her but DeHavilland accepts her help for the Confederate cause Its not about politics or slavery for Melanie her husband is at war and his cause is hersAnd DeHavillands death scene would move the Medusa to tears Its a great tribute to the playing skill of Olivia DeHavilland in that Melanie NEVER becomes a maudlin character She got her first Oscar nomination for Melanie in the Supporting Actress category but lost it to fellow cast member Hattie McDaniel as Scarletts mammyHatties a shrewd judge of character shes a slave but shes also a family confidante of the OHaras As Gable says shes one of the few people he knows whose respect he wantsOf course Gone With the Wind is from the southern point of view Growing up in Atlanta Margaret Mitchell heard reminisces from many Confederate veterans and the stories they told found their way into Gone With the Wind Its about what the white civilian population endured during the war and ReconstructionDavid O Selznick got a bit of irony in there though Please note during the burning of Atlanta the slaves who are being marched out to dig trenches are singing Let My People Go And thats just what the Union Army was coming to Atlanta to doGone With the Wind copped so many Oscars for  that Bob Hope quipped at the Academy Awards ceremony that it was a benefit for David O Selznick Of course it was the Best Picture of  and Vivien Leigh won the first of her two Best Actress AwardsMetroGoldwynMayer kept itself in the black for years by simply rereleasing Gone With the Wind Unlike any other classic film it won new generations of fans with theatrical rerelease Somewhere on this planet there are people seeing this  year old classic and it is winning new fans as I write thisAnd I think Gone With the Wind the telling of the interwoven lives of Rhett Scarlett Ashley and Melanie and the world they knew will be something viewed and read hundreds of years from now,10
2,Margaret Mitchells Gone with the Wind in its true essence is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence Victor Flemings rendition of the classic novel a classic within its own right does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchells evocative masterpiece In the words of Mitchell herself Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War vis√†vis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survivalScarlet OHara the well bred haughty tempestuous and opportunistic protagonist of the saga is an ostensibly flawed individual whose inexorable urge to placate her ego and realize her fancies appears far stronger than her adherence to any credence pious to her people and relevant to her time Her scintillating charm and unrestrained zeal not only make her an object of desire for her male counterparts but also an object of envy for the girls around herVivian Leigh perfectly fits into the caricature of Scarlet OHara She makes full use of her talent courage and guile to portray a part that requires subtlety brusqueness and poise in equal parts It may sound like a hyperbole but no other actress seemed better equipped to play the part a southern belle than Leigh herself who won not one but two Oscars while playing one first for her portrayal of Scarlet OHara and second for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire opposite Marlon Brando In fact her portrayal of Scarlet OHara in which she perfectly blends panache poignancy and peremptoriness is arguably the greatest portrayal by a female lead in cinematic history Leigh uses her onstage experience to improvise in order to add new dimensions and complexities to Scarlets caricature which according to the novel was mostly one dimensional outandout bad Scarlets stubbornness and her impish obsession for a conformist like Ashley who is not only indifferent to her feelings but also incapable of reciprocating the passion and zeal with which she pursues him represent just one dimension of her multifaceted self which is revealed layer by layer with the progression of the narrative The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars a usurper an egomaniac a damsel a nemesis a menace a guardian a savior a patriot a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhoodClark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leighs larger than life portrayal He is an outright reprobate an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures However behind this facade just like Scarlet there is a human capable of love and worthy of being loved These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland who as Melanie is a paragon of love humility and forgiveness She provides a striking contrast to Scarlets caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhoodThe movies direction cinematography editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece one to be savored till eternity The movie is an amalgam of scenes high on emotion and drama which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout The scene in which Scarlets father tells her the importance of mother land deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for is pure gold Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy Butlers famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet You should be kissed and often and by someone who knows how also happens to be one of all time favorite The movie especially its anticlimatic ending brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergoPS Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinemas greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinemas timelessness and its limitless potential A must watch for everyone /http//wwwapotpourriofvestigescom/,10
3,Ive seen the film many times have always enjoyed it But Ive been reading the book for the first time Its a very long novel and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending Its a good read but Margaret Mitchell former newspaper reporter is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it Its the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick Not what parts to film but which parts to leave out So many characters that appeared in the book couldnt be introduced in the movie without extending the films length to well over four hours So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed Selznick was close to running out of money so he asked his angel millionaire Jock Whitney to loan him enough to finish the film The film was finally completed and edited then was testmarketed at a theatre not far from LA The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards which allowed Selznick to rest easy knowing he had a hit on his hands,9
4,The setting is a Georgia plantation The year is  and sixteenyearold Scarlett OHara is infatuated with the blond drowsyeyed Ashley Wilkes  the problem is Ashley plans to marry another woman Little matter that every other man in the county is courting Scarlett and that a charming scoundrel named Rhett Butler is staring at her with questionable intent  she cares only for AshleySuddenly the Civil War brakes out changing the fates and fortunes of all Scarlett clever manipulative and charming proves an adept survivor  but what will she have to do to survive? And will she ever learn whom it is that she really loves?GWTW is one of the most meticulously cast films ever; with the possible exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley in his forties rather old to be playing a man half that age every role was perfectly assigned After you watch Vivien Leigh you will be unable to imagine anyone else playing Scarlett and Hattie McDaniels strong unforgettable performance as Mammy netted her an academy award the first for an AfricanAmerican actor,10
5,It is always in peoples nature to put down great things and to nitpick or sometimes just be plain mean No matter what anyone says this is utterly fantastic in story in special effects in casting with perhaps the sad exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley and in captivation Vivien Leigh is so powerful passionate magnificent and beautiful that you could watch it  times on that ground alone She brings something so convincing and human to the role of the selfish spoilt Scarlett; the character is larger than lifeLeaving Viviens astounding performance aside this remains a sweeping unrivalled epic Watch it Esthers rating /,8
6,I believe that when one views a film one should consider the context in which it was madeBarely  years after talking pictures were first created; less than that after the first fulllength color feature film was created; near the end of the greatest depression this country ever experienced and in which pretty much the only entertainment available to most was radio or the movies; David O Selznik decided to turn the biggest potboiler blockbuster novel into a movieAnd what a movie Stunning color the most popular mail actor of his time perfect music score incredible action scenes story line only  years removed from when it happened and on and on Can you imagine what a storeclerk or a farmer or a teacher experienced in that world seeing Gone With the Wind? What was there to compare with?  was a watershed year for great movies and this one was the greatest produced Try watching this movie as if there were no TV no DVDs only a few radio stations spending maybe the second to the last quarter you owned never having seen such a movie before and you get what I mean Masterful for its time and still timeless today,10
7,Every time I watch this film and Ive seen it more times than I can remember Im always astonished by the freshness of the story the power of the emotions it conveys and the beautiful detailed images of a time long gone That this film was made in the s is almost incomprehensible to me The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to life must have been monumental But come to life it did and still does! A triumph of filmmaking ingenuity and genius that will live on for many generations to come,10

9,A perfect epic movie with a great story and a superb playing cast and one of the biggest productions imaginable Like Ben Hur and War and Peace a classic for all eternity A world is going down a new world is rising out of the ashes of the gone  melancholy fear the sacrifice and hope of a whole generation fighting and suffering in the Amercian Civil War In our troubled times where war and terror are present almost in every corner of our world and in times where the status quo seems to be a faster and fastergoing constant stream and fastergoing flow where nobody can be sure or predict what the future ahead may bring to us a movie more relevant than most people think,10
10,One of the greatest achievements in film history This is not only an eyepopping cinematic treat but one of the greatest stories ever put on celluloid The movie lasts nearly four hours its longer than any other mainstream commercially successful film ever made But the time goes by so quickly that youll miss it when its overOf course we all know that this movie is set in the days of the Civil War in the s Its the story of Scarlett OHara a plantation owners daughter who is very beautiful and who seemingly MUST have her own way at all times Shes willing to scheme and manipulate everyone in her path until she gets it When the movie opens the country is on the verge of civil war North against South but Scarlett barely notices and doesnt care in the least Her biggest obsession is that shes in love with dreamy/poetic Ashley Wilkes and she stays in love with him throughout  percent of the movie The only problem isAshley doesnt have any particular interest in her at all In fact he spends most of the movie being married to gentle Melanie Hamilton a fact that frustrates Scarlett to no end Ashley remains the one object of her desire that she is never to obtainShe would have been better off pining after Rhett Butler a much more solid rather dangerous man with a reputation as a nogood scoundrel He is openly attracted to Scarlett grows to love her although he dare not let her know or shell use it against him and its obvious that he would make a lot better match for her than the drab Ashley Very late in the movie he finally does marry Scarlett But its probably too late for them to be happy by then ironically and they never really are happy togetherThe complicated and utterly fascinating relationship between Scarlett Rhett Ashley and Melanie is the fuel that keeps the movie going But there are dozens if not hundreds of little extra twists and turns that fill out the movie The Civil War backdrop for one the colorful supporting roles for another A great many reviewers here have seen Scarlett as purely a selfish onedimensional manipulative shrew But shes far more than that! This is a complex multidimensional young woman with lots of conflicting motives Yes shes selfish and manipulative But shes also selfless the extreme sacrifices that she makes on behalf of her family and Melanie keeping in mind that other than her father she doesnt even particularly like any of them are nothing short of heroic She is overwhelmingly protective of her loved ones Shes a ball of fire when work needs to be done and shes fiercely courageous Despite her hardness she does also grow as a person To her great credit she slowly comes to value Melanies friendship and support She genuinely loves and is proud of her daughter And at the very end of the movie she does finally realize how illsuited she and Ashley have always been for each other and how little passion ever actually existed thereSome quick high points and a few flaws the supporting roles are superb in every way Even the rather bland Ashley is given as much life as could be expected by actor Leslie Howard and the other parts are vivid and fill out the movie Two female parts in particular wise funny respected Mammy Hattie McDaniel and wistful decentatheart prostitute Belle Watling Ona Munson are standoutsThe scenery and photography is possibly the most superb ever done in the history of film Many scenes are just sumptuously lit and filmed The gripping nighttime escape from Atlanta the whole city seemingly in flames is one of the most spectacular action sequences ever done The sunsets are jawdroppingly beautifulMuch has been said about the supposed racism of this film Its true that it does portray black slaves as being HAPPY to be slaves But much more important its also true that the wisest person in the whole movie is Mammy This black lady may be a slave later an employee but she is smart funny observant and shes treated as an equal if not a superior throughout the movie And its made clear she deserves it With no irony or rebuke whatever she scornfully refers to certain lowlifes as poor white trash and we know Mammy knows too that if they get called that they deserve it She may be black but she isnt inferior to them or anybody And we root for her all the wayA few minor flaws and I do mean minor  Most of the acting looks pretty modern but there are a very few scenes where it seems a little oldstyle Hey enjoy the movie and dont worry bout it People didnt do todays method acting in the s  Some of the raw scenes still have a Hollywood gloss to them Even when Scarlett is on the brink of starvation and probably hasnt had a good bath in weeks she looks perfectly made up with only a few hairs out of place Oh well It *was* bigtime Hollywood after all  The second half of the movie is more talky and less actionoriented than the first I would not say its more boring just less movement I dont find it draggy but some people do Still a heck of a good story and a great film so enjoy the ride!,0
11,For some nostalgic dreamers Gone With the Wind is a glorious swan song depicting the fall of the South during a devastating Civil War and its reconstruction on the ashes of the Old Order a Civilization forever gone with the wind Its the adaptation of Margaret Mitchells epic tale written in bold letters with this peculiar ability to portray the Yankees as the bad guys so common in the stories related by Southerners as they invite us to understand their idealism if not to root for it a vision of Gallantry and Old European Nobility where women were courted wives were submissive to their husbands and slaves treated with paternalismBut for some idealistic spirits Gone With the Wind resonates as one of the most heartbreaking pages of American History when the North fought the South in the name of Liberty Freedom and Justice and when History written by the victorious side ultimately showed the Confederate as the ones who were wrong Gone With the Wind chronicles what the South used to be a world where coexisted two cultures the Whites and the Colored And the depiction of the slaves oscillates between the high pitched voice of the simpleminded Prissy Butterfly McQueen who knew nothing about birthin babies and the wisdom and authority of Mammy Hattie McDaniel in her Oscarwinning role two figures two extremes so rooted in our hearts its impossible to dislike them despite the obvious stereotypesFor literate minds History is only the setting while the film is an incredible achievement in storytelling inviting us to follow a gallery of magnificent and appealing characters during a slice of life where the passing of time can be felt when History affects story with mercy or ruthlessness sometimes tragic sometimes ironic Its a narrative whose emotional core is the heroine Scarlett OHara Vivien Leigh whose heart belongs to the charming blonde Ashley Wilkes Leslie Howard married to the gentle and extremely goodhearted cousin Melanie Hamilton Olivia de Havilland A triangular love that sets the personality of Scarlett as a remarkable antiheroine selfish greedy jealous but so brave courageous and generous when the circumstances of War forever changed the face of the South A great soul that could only be revealed by a great opportunity a pivotal metamorphosis incarnated by the iconic As God is my witness Ill never be hungry againThe fascinating aspect of Scarletts personality is that her flaws elevated her above all the other characters she doesnt care for etiquette for traditions her spirit is free her ego is big and her heart so vulnerable While the South is definitely turned to the past Scarlett thinks of the future as she says after all tomorrow is another day Scarlett is a modern figure and thats what makes her so appealing both in the film and to the audience And Rhett Butler Clark Gable in his most defining role as the visitor from Charleston is Scarlets perfect match Both dont belong to that era they think of money greed prosperity and passion They embody all the values that America would stand for transcending the oldfashioned setting of the South But like the Souths enthusiasm for War the same pride that drives their passion would ruin their relationshipsFor many passionate hearts this is one of the most intense romances ever adapted to the big screen a frustrating and seemingly impossible love between two strongminded egos two faces staring at each other as if they were at the verge of an irresistible passion or about to fight each other As Scarlett was visibly jealous of Melanie when she went to bed with Ashley the movie makes you penetrate the soul of these characters with such intensity you could feel she wished that Melanie could die A childish and immature attitude probably shared with Butler who wouldnt have minded if Ashley could die in the War too The love between Rhett and Scarlett is made of the same idealism that built the South myth a lost but so endearing cause a fire that burnt inside and made pretty fitting that the most intimate and sensual moment they had was under the orange sky during Atlantas big fire Love has never been as passionate as a loveandhate relationship and never seemed a romance so comparable to a lost cause mirroring the Southerners very faith in victory Rhetts last stand when he takes Scarlett up the stairs in the one night she wouldnt turn him out is the perfect illustration of a love that pumped its energy from hate and anger As Scarlett lost in her love for Ashley will never realize that her man is Rhett and when she does Rhett is already fed up and finally delivers the most unforgettable comeuppance ever Frankly my dear I dont give a damn before disappearing in a foggy mist Scarlett gets a magnificent lesson about life and wouldnt have been as likable without this last slap in the face This I dont give a damn voted # in the American Film Institutes Top  Movie quotes was Rhetts revenge and he sure deserved it and many wannabeScarlett would admit that tooBut while Gone With the Wind deals with lost causes its more than anything the triumph of Cinema as the most defining Art of the last century Echoing the novels status as a best seller its one of the greatest films of all time the greatest casting ever the greatest score and the greatest challenge for superlatives Victor Flemings superproduction that would become a landmark in filmmaking with its unique visual style and beautiful cinematography in colors forever incarnated by Scarletts shadowy silhouette standing beside a tree during a beautiful sunset Along with The Wizard of Oz and Mr Smith Goes to Washington Gone With the Wind is probably Hollywoods Golden Age reaching its pinnacle before the War would come in  ,10

13,Gone With the Wind is without a doubt one of the most magnificent romances ever A realistic fiction that ends abruptly and leaves its viewer/reader starving for more but unfortunately never produced a sequel A book was written in the s that continued the story but trust me it sucked Scarlett was such a complex character selfish spirited passionate about everything she wants But in the end you see that Scarlett changes she learns about communication and respect for all those who love her after she lost everyone who did Never read the sequel if you read the first one because it isnt a Margaret Mitchell novel and therefor you wont SEE the complexity Those of you who voted for this movie to have one star I pity you You cannot see the complexity or beauty of this wonderful tale or you just didnt see it and decided to vote for a movie you thought would be stupid when in fact it is the most popular civil war movie in history Please support this movie and give it FAIR votes It won ten Oscars and has claim to one of the most amazing casts ever so take that into consideration plus the effort it took when you give this movie a one/ten It deserves so much more,10
14,There has never been any movie in the cinema history that was more a legend than Gone with the wind It is undeniable that this movie contains lots of goofs but despite all this it is a blockbuster and a real masterpiece Completely NOT overratedI love this movie I cant explain why exactly There are sooo many reasons I first saw it when I was a little kid and still cant forget it Its so special if you can return to movie even when you had seen it more than  times And GWTW is this kind of a movieIn my opinion a movie can not be a good when the acting is not good And there acting is great! Every character is portrayed so magnificently!I will start with the supporting players Barbara ONeil though only  while filming played mother of quite adult daughters She was the Ellen Robillard Mitchell descirbed in her book so stative so smart so lady Thomas Mitchell should have received Oscar for his Gerald OHara portroyal and I think he did not just because he won for Stagecoach that year Scarletts sisters are really well cast But the best supporting performance of the film is this one of Hattie McDaniels She is simply magnificent moving and unforgettable as Mummy Just amazingMany people claim that Leslie Howard did not fit the role of Ashley They may be right in some sense but lets think it over twice Ashley was more handsome as Mitchell described him but he was a dreamer who could not find himself in a new cruel world And Howard showed this quality as best as possibleOf course Olivia de Havillands performance of Melanie was as worth of Oscar as Hattie McDaniels but later on she was given what she deserved Oscars for To each his own and The Heiress She plays Melanie with such a sensibility but she manages to show her hidden strength but not in a dominate way Clark Gable was so unsure of his talent till the end of his life I think that he was a great actor Hes so real as Rhett and he has to play several dramatic scenes And he does it perfectlyremember that playing those scenes like those after Scarletts miscarriage needed acting talent Hes perfect But I wont hide my opinion that Vivien Leighs Scarlett is the best and most powerful point of the whole movie Vivien won the role when she was completely unknown She managed to master the Southern accent as well She did not play Scarlett She WAS Scarlett But only in this movie She never acted any other character the same way She is terrific and has all those features that original Mitchells Scarlett possesses I heard that she wanted to play the part exactly as Mitchell created it and Fleming wanted her to play it just as a bitch so they fought about it badly but finally Vivien did a great work and her Oscar was something very obviousIf you love good cinema if you want to see something moving and something that is not getting old though almost ! do not miss it,10
15,Gone with the Wind is one of the greatest American classics ever made It tells the story of Scarlett OHara played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh She is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still care for her She is in love with Ashley Wilkes Leslie Howard but he marries to Melanie Hamilton She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance A new man in Scarletts life is Rhett Butler Clark Gable but Scarlett does everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and her own benefit Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart mainly because they are much the same They both think the world is there for them Melanie and Scarlett become friendsThe movie is set in the time of the Civil War What happens exactly with Scarlett Rhett Ashley and Melanie is for you to see but the war is pretty important for the story and the way it is used is great The story itself is great anyway Although the movie is long it is never boring A reason for that is the performances I already mentioned Olivia de Havilland Clark Gable is very good charming and sometimes funny Hattie McDaniel as the black made is outstanding but I have to say that the best thing in this movie is Vivien Leigh To make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do but she makes it seem so easy It is one of the strongest performances I have seenBesides the story and the acting we have the music the sets the costumes the cinematography and of course the direction It is all great It was made in  and over  years later it still is a very impressive movie,10
16,I watched this movie for the first time at fourteen years old I enjoyed it immensely I have always been a fanatic for anything Civil War themed so when my mother recommended it to me it was a yes from the start The opening scenes show the young Scarlett OHara as she awaits her fathers arrival Beloved in the eyes of all the men in the county Scarlett has acquired a high selfesteem but when the War is announced to come after all the highspirited Scarlett soon faces obstacles that are determined to destroy her faith and her hope She meets many people along the way she even gets married With new relationships new responsibilities come as well Rhett Butler a man determined to have Scarlett for his own comes into her life half way through both the novel and the movie and he fights her on topics such as love politics and societal roles Even after the Civil War Scarlett is still faced with many decisions She has faced death marriage and defeat many times Still willing to go on even when it seemed impossible Scarlett leaves us with the last quote of the novel and book After all tomorrow is another day,10
17,If you have ever considered GWTW to be less than a masterpiece youll be swayed by the th Anniversary Edition DVD The disc set features the remastered film and more extras than you could possibly watch in one day after watching the film of course The twohour makingof documentary is fascinating and shows how the producer David O Selznick of the film affected the cast directors and writers  and shows the publicity frenzy that was the hunt for Scarlett The feature of Olivia De Havilland in  discussing her role as Melanie is a real treat The picture and sound are great on the th Anniversary DVD and the special features are a true treasure Accept no substitutes seek out the th Anniversary DVD and bring it home,10
18,Here is how I feel about Gone With the Wind My moms side of the family is Southern They lived mostly around where Scarlett and her gang hung out Some had plantations and owned slaves My grandparents were old fashioned in the clueless way Margaret Mitchell was Ive heard their side lots of times and I found it to be wrong If I were Black I wouldnt like to pass by statues erected to past oppressors either nor would I want to have flags in my face constantly reminding me of a sorrowful pastHowever please consider this If youre going to get upset at GWTW and ban showing it then you would also want to eliminate the rest of the movies from back then which show stereotypes as well correct? Unfortunately ALMOST ALL probably about  of Black roles for the stage and screen pres were just as racist as in GWTW many were worseThe problem is if you get rid of these movies you erase the work of any Black actors back then as well You wont see why Hattie McDaniel won an Oscar for a performance in a land so bigoted she could not sit in the audience during the premiere You wont see lots of superb singing dancing and acting by any AfricanAmerican during this time They will be completely ignored because of the contextYou wind up punishing all these people who wanted to work in entertainment and had little influence over the roles they played as well as those whites who made those moviesAnd Hollywood whitewashes and pretties up EVERYTHING It always has Dont get upset because they did it for the millionth time in GWTWConsider the movie  about ancient Sparta There was no mention of slaves they owned or the organized pedophilia that went into the training of boys Google it if you dont know what Im talking aboutAnd yet there were no mass protests at the rose colored vision in the movie No one came to picket the film because it omitted a horrendous flaw in Spartan societyWhy? Well for one thing that was well over  years ago What happened in Sparta is no longer directly relevant to anyone No normal modern army expects raping young boys as part of their trainingIts no longer relevantUnfortunately GWTW IS STILL RELEVANT Many of the problems portrayed in this film and any film from back then with Black actors are still haunting the US Denying that there is anything wrong and everything is just fine and has been fixed is simply denying realityWhy do I care? Unfortunately GWTW is one of my favorite books and films It has a strong still unique story of feminism I can relate to That is what is relevant to me in the film I have tended in the past to brush aside the slave part because it seems surreal to me to own people Im certainly not sitting there hoping the good ol days can come back I like the modern world with its aim of acceptance and tolerance I get the feeling the vast majority of viewers feel the same wayHow do we solve this problem? When Blacks are truly integrated and that day will come then GWTW will no longer be that relevant It wont strike any raw nerves The protests will die down just as they have for every other hot button issue whos time has come and goneTrue classics never die GWTW has many redeeming features which have made it endlessly entertaining to me and thousands of other people Keep talking about it show the movie now and then with perhaps a short lecture on history and context before and know that in time the pain will fadeALSO KEEP IN MIND when you criticize Scarlett for her actions there was NO OTHER WAY to survive in the Victorian world if you were a woman other than SEDUCING A MAN Its not like she could go off to college and get a degree Women were NOT allowed to own land have a bank accountvote hold a job besides perhaps a hat maker or much more commonly a prostitute etc If she seems strange for marrying men she didnt lovekeep in mind it was that or be totally broke and homelessMuch of the criticism of her character comes from total lack of knowledge about this contextAs for the movie itself I first saw it when I was thirteen It made quite an impression Forty years or so later it still moves me Some people criticize the main character Scarlett because shes not nice Shes not typical of a main female characterScarlett behaves in an uncomfortably realistic way Shes not a nice lady she is a superrare female antihero Shes not comfortingly evil but shes never going to be a goody two shoes Some people dont know how to handle thatMelanie on the other hand is criticized for being unrealistic I would ask anyone who thinks that to understand the context of the times she lived in There was no mass media save for the local newspaper and that was hardly an international trove of information as they are now No TV no radio no internet A person could grow up to be innocent in a way we simply dont experience in modern societyIts a movie about survival And its a war movie without battle scenes I would urge you to watch it,10
19,Im sorry I generally dont like this film Expansive epic picturesque an achievement for its time  OK A compelling story about the devastation hardship suffering and brutality of the Civil War and the courage and resilience of its survivors  OK but credit the novel for all thatA key problem is the heroine Scarlett OHara who remains insufferably selfish and inhumane throughout this long movie Are we supposed to admire her? I cannot Another problem is that the film drags in many places Too much screen time is focused on men professing love for Scarlett and Scarlett expressing her hopeless adoration for Ashley Gosh move on with it! Even for its time I cant see how its flaws failed to overcome its grandeur,6
20,I first saw Gone with the Wind in its initial commercial TV broadcast in  I have since seen the film numerous times via a succession of home video media videotape laserdisc and DVD Yet seeing the film once more on bluray and a large widescreen high def monitor is like seeing it completely anew The sweeping cinematography of this classic epic film has never before been delivered to home audiences in such stunning power and detail The achingly romantic score has never sounded better whether heard in original mono or reconstructed stereo Rhett Butler Clark Gable has never looked more rakishly handsome nor Scarlett OHara Vivien Leigh more alluringly sensual In short for anyone not having seen Gone with the Wind in glorious bigscreen Technicolor almost all film viewers under the age of  the recent bluray release is a mustsee revelationBeyond the compelling audiovisual experience Gone with the Wind thankfully retains its fascination as a central piece of American popular culture  a work of art complex and rich enough not only to bear up under multiple viewings but to reveal like great literature different aspects of its meaning depending on the cultural and personal variables that a viewer brings to the experience There were certainly a great number of impressions in my recent viewing that I dont remember having in quite the same way   or even  years agoFor one thing characters and character relationships impacted me much differently than in the past Scarletts multiple marriages and affairs ‚Äì even the protracted love/hate odyssey with Rhett ‚Äì seemed less interesting now than the strength of character that enables her physical survival and success as a business woman In many ways Scarlett is clearly not an ante and postbellum Southern belle but a woman of the s newly emerging from a patriarchal culture and acquiring a social role and status equivalent to a malesAs with other s films that touch upon the redefinition of female roles Scarletts acquisition of masculine power is greeted with ambivalence or downright hostility Even Rhett who is generally bemused by and attracted to Scarletts unbridled selfinterested power grabs eventually tries to tame and dominate Scarlett via marriage On one occasion he tries to persuade her to give up the lumber mill and become a more devoted mother to Bonnie Blue On another he compares the heartless Scarlett unfavorably to Belle Watling another hardheaded businesswoman but one whose ancient profession is considerably less threatening Ultimately Rhett attempts to assert his masculine power by an act of sexual aggression for which he would today be subject to domestic rape charges Amazingly given the era in which the film was made nothing works for long Scarlett is indomitable and irrepressible Unlike other s heroines Scarlett is NEVER reduced to a subordinate role In the end Tara and the screen are hers and hers aloneAnother thing that struck me in my latest viewing of Gone with the Wind was how much its creators particularly David O Selznick strove to temper the racist content of the story materials Of course they were unsuccessful from todays perspective but when the film is compared to Birth of a Nation the original film epic of the Souths secession and destruction one can clearly see its progressive designs First of all glorification of the Souths rebellion is tempered from the outset by the dissenting voices of such otherwise dissimilar characters as Rhett and Ashley both of whom foresee that the South has written its own ticket to destruction by entering into a war it cannot possibly win and for an historically dubious cause Notably the two central male characters view slavery askance Rhett is never a slaveholding gentleman And Ashley who is the scion of slaveholders reveals plans to free the Wilkes slaves upon the death of his father Moreover the slaves on the Tara plantation while still subject to stereotypical treatment are far more prominent and rounded as characters than in any previous American film intended principally for white audiences This is particularly true of sagelike Mammy of course but not only of herThe stark differences between the Mitchell/Selznick version of Civil War history and DW Griffiths can be seen most clearly in the postwar Reconstruction period In Gone with the Wind the really ugly stereotypes of empowered blacks are absent with the negative focus centering instead on white carpetbaggers Even the threats to Scarletts Southern Womanhood come not from renegade blacks but first from a white Northern deserter and later from white scalawags in Shantytown a locale that Scarlett intrepidly if foolishly ventures through From this latter threat she is pointedly rescued not by chivalrous whites but by her former slave Sam who beats off the wouldbe rapists and drives Scarlett safely home What a far cry this is from Birth of a Nation where Little Sister throws herself from a cliff rather than be raped by a former slave who has stalked her through perilous woodsAbove all Gone with the Wind deliberately avoids all mention of the Ku Klux Klan the terminally embarrassing heroes of Birth of a Nation The only scene that comes close to a Klan allusion occurs following the attempted assault on Scarlett when Ashley Dr Meade and thenhusband Mr Kennedy set about clandestinely to clean out the scalawags Yet even then their targets are not primarily black nor do the avengers don robes The audience is not even permitted to witness the attack ‚Äì only Ashleys wounds from itIf Americans in the st century can still respond to Gone With the Wind  and clearly they can  it is not only because of its grand pictorial displays and epic action but because in terms of gender and race this classic of Hollywoods  peak year looks forward to a modern tomorrow as much as if not more than it laments a tragically flawed American past,9
21,I was dating at the time this came out in a small theater on Hollywood blvd for a short run Me and my girlfriend decided to see a movie and chose this one not knowing anything about it We sat in the balcony and was immediately captured by the music characters storyline and each other as we watched what we thought was a memorable night out together Unknown to me when part one ended I thought the movie was over and remarked boy that was good but I wonder what happened after that We got up to go and found out it was only intermission I cannot describe the feelings of joy knowing there was more We were not disappointed either When it ended I felt totally satisfied and changed forever more A great movie with my future wife locked into each other for our lifetime Since then I have seen this movie so many times never tiring of it I bought the collectors sets vhs and finally the DVD Just finished watching it again loving every moment until the end Will I see it again? Why not after all tomorrow is another dayGood movie to eat with while watching,10
22,I love this film I have seen it a handful of times and even though I am always a little frustrated by the stubborn pride of the two main characters I can never dislike it True Scarlet OHara is a foolish woman who believes she is madly in love with someone elses husband but she is just as bad as the proud Rhett Butler who loves her through it all Their problem is admitting their true feelings deep down and in this small selfish act is where we find the heart of the story and its timelessness We all love that great timeless love story despite its tragic ending and Scarlets tenacity for surviving and keeping her family alive even if it did involve tricks and schemes on her part Despite all this the film managed to capture the heart of Americans everywhere and even those hearts of the generations that followed That is the true power of this film Aside from being able to enchant its audiences Gone With The Wind was truly a groundbreaking film in American Cinema It was one of the first major films that came out in vividly welldone color not only that but the photography was phenomenal also Much more can be said about this film but for now all I will say is this Fantastic film worth the  hours,10
23,I waited  year before even considering watching Gone With The Wind Four plus hours long? ? It was as old as my Dad But finally in a desire to see all these classic movies I sat down to watch itsince then and before writing this review I have now seen it three times Gone With The Wind is quite simply breath taking It is brilliant and captivating and perhaps one of the greatest epics you will ever lay eyes on Some people consider Gone With The Wind to be the greatest film ever made and its pretty easy to see why Especially if you factor in the time period this was made the special effects the sheer grandeur of it is impressive NOW let alone  years ago The raging war the fields being worked the attacks being carried out the people evacuating and the beauty and horror of the south during the civil war Add onto that this incredible unmatched chemistry between the romantic leads and youve got one incredible epic that defined epic before it even existedVivien Leigh is Scarlett OHara One of the most influential and recognizable characters in movie historyprobably top  Leighs Scarlett will remain in your memory forever Her character goes through so many changes and at times you literally despise hershes whiny and needy and mousy and then in the next breath you see this incredible strength and wisdom and this ability to make her such a hero Shes a strong female lead and her performance is amazing Scarlett OHara is one of the greatest characters in movie history Clark Gable as the irrepressible Captain Rhett Butler At first I thought Gables performance lacked depth I thought he came across as a movie star there to show off his stuff but then as the film progressed I began to see what Captain Butler was all about Rhett Butler had this air of overconfidence a macho party man with nothing holding him down including political ties His reputation as a drunkard and a rich bachelor suited him fine Then Scarlett comes into his life and he falls hopelessly in love with the most unlikely girl that plagues him for the years and years Gable is a master and looks incredible on screen and shows why men of his era were leading men the likes of which weve never known He definitely deserved his Oscar Nomination for the role The supporting cast is so huge I could go into detail on every single one of them They all do an incredible job including the first African American actor to be nominated for an Academy Award Hattie McDaniel who is just wonderful as Mammy their beloved house servant Leslie Howard as Scarletts love interest for years and years Ashley Wilkes Olivia de Havilland was one of my favorite supporting roles as the loving and kind Melanie Wilkes who marries Ashley away from Scarlett She was terrific in her role one of the best characters in the film Harry Davenport Thomas Mitchell Barbara ONeil Butterfly McQueenso so so many other terrific performances in this film Also watch for uncredited and small roles by future stars George Reeves Superman and Richard Farnsworth The Straight Story/Anne of Green Gables For years I havent been a fan of old classics Just now am I getting around to watching them but if youre the same way put that aside and see Gone With The Wind Its LONG there is no doubt about it but its utter brilliance story action romance and just everything about it will keep you absolutely riveted I now completely understand why people consider this one of the greatest films ever made if not THEE greatest I dont know if I can say that exactly because I have my own list of favorites for different reasons but I will say Gone With The Wind is perhaps the exact definition of a classic and worthwhile from beginning to end One of the greatest films I have ever seen and I will be sure to add this to the list of movies I watch again and again /,10
24,Over the weekend I was given the opportunity to see Gone With The Wind in theaters with my parents for its th anniversary Its kind of embarrassing to me that I a selfprofessed lover and at this point addict of cinema hadnt yet seen a movie that is universally considered one of if not THE best American movie ever made Part of me had always been turned off by its  hour runtime as I am in college and dont often have the time to sit down and watch a movie in a single hour sitting But another part of me had shied away from Gone due to all the blatant racism in it that I had been warned of I had wasted my time watching DW Griffiths epic The Birth of a Nation and did not want to sit through another slog of a film that is great technically but ruined by its subtext So when I sat down in the theater I was hesitant but excited And yes Gone With The Wind is undoubtedly racist but it is also so much more and the fact that it can be both great while having all of its apparent flaws is the very reason why it is undoubtedly a classic,10
