0,Technically speaking I have seen this Fritz Lang silent scifi before but this was the first time I saw it in any shape by which I could fairly evaluate it I had previously watched Metropolis on a public domain VHS from the s The print was terribly scratched and while there were a few memorable images the story was so incoherent that their context was usually unclear Though this was clearly not the best way to see Metropolis I was still left with an impression of this supposed classic as a dusty museum piece that was praised by critics because they were expected to like it So finally seeing a restored and expanded copy was as much as a revelation as seeing Once Upon a Time in the West letter boxed in how it led me to reevaluate my opinion of the movie The movie is a strange mixture of political speculation political parable apocalyptic fantasy and religious allegory It depicts a futuristic city that is divided between the wretched workers who toil in the depths tending the machines and the upper classes who dwell in luxury up in the skyscrapers The hero the idle pampered son of the citys supervisor Joh Fredersen changes his ways and becomes concerned with the plight of the lower classes after catching a glimpse of Maria the Madonna of the workers His father meanwhile is plotting to thwart Maria with the help of the mad scientist Rotwang who has discovered how to create robot replicas of human beings One of the most surprising things about watching this version is just how much I didnt see In addition to restoring scenes to the film the DVD also includes inter titles to explain pieces of the plot that cannot be found in any version With these changes the story becomes much clearer particularly the machinations of Rotwang and the master of Metropolis Perhaps most importantly a whole new subplot is added involving the heros dead mother Hel who was loved by both his father and Rotwang With this clarification of the backstory the close but adversarial relationship between Rotwang and Fredersen becomes much clearer In some ways it recalls the family backstory of the Star Wars movies Of course the real strength of Metropolis isnt the story which is pretty silly and probably wouldnt have worked in anything but a silent film but its amazing visuals which in their scale and ambitiousness look forward to  and Blade Runner Actually though in most respects silent films now look primitive one area in which they have the edge over modern filmmaking is in their frequently grandiose production design Metropolis employs huge sets to show the hellish factories of the subterranean world The models of the citys towering skyscrapers are also surprisingly convincing for a s film Even beyond the expansive production design and for the time special effects Langs visuals are all consistently inventive The robot Maria provides some of the movies most iconic images including her transformation into a human being In a later scene she performs for upperclass men in a nightclub and as she performs a striptease that in s Germany was apparently seen as very decadent the screen is filled with wet staring eyeballs A sign of Langs visual lavishness and the studios that he doesnt hesitate to throw in lavish dream and hallucination sequences to drive home a point or illustrate a characters state of mind For instance when the hero first enters the subterranean city and sees rows upon rows of workers toiling on huge machines he imagines the furnace transforming into a monstrous idols head into which the workers are being sacrificed At another point while hes sick in bed he imagines statues of the Seven Deadly Sins coming to life and advancing out from a wall in a cathedral When Maria preaches her message of peace and understanding to the workers she tells them the story of the Tower of Babel of a management vs labor parable and Lang gives us spectacular images of the towers construction and fall In a sound film many of these scenes would have seemed redundant and overliteral but theyre what silent cinema does best tell a story without the advantage or obstacle of dialogue The story is a little slow to start but once it picks up Metropolis becomes one of the most directly involving silent films that Ive seen In addition to being a pioneering example of the cinematic possibilities of science fiction Metropolis also has to be one of the earliest disaster films as the workers riot and sabotage the machines endangering the entire city Lang creates a sense of rising fury and nihilism in the last hour that in a strange way reminded me of what was going to happen to Germany in less than  years,9
1,Who ever heard of an epic science fiction film? Especially in the s? Sure some science fiction movies are huge today such as George Lucas latest goofy Star Wars movie but in  Fritz Lang came out with a brilliant film about what the future would be like if people went on living the way they were living back then And sure enough we went right ahead living the way we were living the population got bigger and more crowded and now modern society is not a whole lot different from what was presented in Metropolis The story is about a young rich kid without a care in the world who becomes concerned about the way that society Metropolis was run by his father John Frederson the master of Metropolis He lives in a Pleasure Garden high above the level of the workers and he worries about what would happen if the huge number of workers were to turn against his father given the terrible conditions under which they live and work Some of the best scenes in the film take place in the underground mines showing the workers portrayed as little more than components on a gigantic sinister looking machine The scene where the machine overheated even contained some impressive stunts as well as interesting cinematography as the machine transforms into a giant devillooking monster  After countless workers are consumed by it no wonder this was Hitlers favorite film they are immediately replaced by other workers who go right to the same spots that the previous men left and resume their robotic movements If some of these scenes men can be seen being carried away on stretchers after having been injured and the rest of the workers keep right on working hardly even noticingThe way that the workers are portrayed as lifeless machines is one of the more potent elements of this film as well as the most revealing about the directors intentions When his son complains about the tragic things that go on in the mines Frederson replies that such accidents are unavoidable but his son still insists that they deserve credit for building the city This is the kind of content that foreshadows some serious mutiny and at the same time it shows what may very well happen when large groups of people feel mistreated `Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups is a saying that doesnt necessarily only apply to stupid people as Metropolis suggests Fritz Lang brilliantly portrays this very complex story with extremely limited dialogue and the result is still compelling today The special effects in this film are decades ahead of its time  it even resembles The Fifth Element in many ways except that the two films can hardly be compared  and the acting and especially the elaborately created sets are stunning to say the least An excellent film Metropolis is one of the few that should never be forgotten,10
2,I doubt that Id ever seen anything resembling a complete version of METROPOLIS before though certain of its scenes were familiar to me if only as used and abused in such films as Diane Keatons HEAVEN   In any case whatever I had seen before had nothing like the clarity and beauty of the Kino restoration  I expected to be distracted by the restorations technique of concise written descriptions of missing sequences but the narrative coherence that these provided was definitely worth it  As exaggerated as the style of acting seems by contemporary standards some performances such as the Master of the city are amazingly nuanced and layered and Brigitte Helm is stunning as both Maria and her evil clone The meticulous design of the film the unerring camera placement and Langs muscular choreography of the crowd scenes are breathtaking Id thought of METROPOLIS as a curiosity important = dull but now Ive come to appreciate it as the seminal work it has always been,10
3,Fritz Langs Metropolis is the first true masterpiece of science fiction in film You can see its influence in films such as Star Wars The Matrix Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Blade Runner and countless others Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were in some cases phenomenal I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is  years old because a lot has happened in film since then Yet if you look at the basic elements of this movie  its story characters artwork cinematography etc I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late s Also take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this The performances and set designs are going to be over the top That was part of the style Metropolis may not be for everyone but for those willing to read between the lines this film still has a lot to offer!,8
4,In the future the society of Metropolis is divided in two social classes the workers who live in the underground below the machines level and the dominant classes that lives on the surface The workers are controlled by their leader Maria Brigitte Helm who wants to find a mediator between the upper class lords and the workers since she believes that a heart would be necessary between brains and muscles Maria meets Freder Fredersen Gustav Fröhlich the son of the Lord of Metropolis Johhan Fredersen Alfred Abel in a meeting of the workers and they fall in love for each other Meanwhile Johhan decides that the workers are no longer necessary for Metropolis and uses a robot pretending to be Maria to promote a revolution of the working class and eliminate themMetropolis is a fantastic futuristic view of the fight of classes When Metropolis was shot it was a romantic revolutionary period of mankind history with socialist movements around the world Fritz Lang directed and wrote the screenplay of this masterpiece certainly inspired in this historical moment and defending a position of agreement and understanding between both sides showing that they need each other I wonder how this great director was able to produce such special effects in  with very primitive cameras and equipment The city of Metropolis is visibly inspired in New York The performance of Brigitte Helm is stunning in her double role and this movie is mandatory for any person that says that like cinema as an art My vote is tenTitle Brazil MetropolisNote On  March  I saw this film again on BluRay,10
5,Metropolis is surely one of the greatest films ever made  Its scope its reach its magnitude and its message are truly incredible even by todays standards of filmmaking  Seen in context of its premier in  Metropolis is a giant of filmdom and film history  Lots of people always ask what makes a movie great and in particular Metropolis  A great film is one that stirs the imagination leaves the viewer with images that will last perhaps forever forces contemplation of issues dealing with the very essence of life and achieves a kind of immortality  Metropolis is a film that succeeds with each of these criteria  Metropolis is a film that hailed in a new era of making films with it futuristic settings halluciatory scenes and its breadth of spirit and sheer scope most clearly exhibited by its cast of epic proportions  There are images that blind the viewer with genius such as the beginning scene of the changing of the workers or the creation of the robot Maria  Metropolis challenges its viewers to think about their relationship with society both as a whole and with each individual as well as contemplate the rationale of divisions amongst peoples and groups  Lastly Metropolis has stood the test of time  It is a landmark film and an ignitor for the evolution of the science fiction/fantasy film genre  The story itself is simplea Biblical allegory about how people with a vision should share that vision in order to make it happen  The film is anything but simple  It is immense and a rich legacy that director Fritz Lang has left us,0
6,I was shocked to find myself riveted to this movie This is without a doubt the best scifi movie Ive ever seen! Let me explain my position We have all seen modern scifi movies and argued over which is the best ever made but those film makers have high speed film and computers Imagine trying to make a movie today with only the tools available to Fritz Lang in  and even if you used a modern camcorder it would be nigh impossible! This is a must see for all persons interested in the history of film as well as just good fun for everyone The social metaphores as well as the religious and philosophical double meanings are a sight to behold,10
7,This must be one of the greatest movies of all time I found myself almost in a state of shock during the whole movie Everything was perfect The story was great the filming was pure genius and the effects directly from another dimensionI dont think any movie after this one have gotten so much out of the available effects of the time as this one Nowadays they have super computers generating special effects Sure they look good but its no big deal making them Back in  computers werent even invented yet all effects had to be done by hand or in simple editing And when you take a look at all the thins that have been done in this movie its impossible not to get impressed Huge buildings explosions flooding picture phones however did he come up with the very idea? transformation sequences robots and so on No movie has ever pulled the limits of special effects as much as this one Star Wars and Jurassic Park are also known as limit pullers in special effects but they dont even come closeThen you have the filming Everything is perfect The use of body language is tremendous the light setting perfect everything well timed and perfectly captured by the camera Ive never been witness to such a treat in filming other placesAnd the story!!! Perfect in every detail Intriguing exciting and thrilling with lots of religious undertones and tyranic leaders No wonder Hitler liked this movieI dont know how the original music of the film was but the new music for the restored  minute version I saw was really good and moodsetingAll in all This is one of the most perfect movies of all time and it deserves anything it can get Never has a / been as secure as for this movie,10
8,Silent movies are not for everyone Neither are subtitles Those brave enough to view a movie with no sound and words that are far and few between should definitely enjoy this silent masterpiece One of the biggest productions of its time Metropolis still holds its own when set design and special effects are compared But what Metropolis really has is orginality This GermanExpressionist film had such originality in everything from its costumes to its views of a future modern city that its ideas can still be seen everywhere in modern scifi Star Warss CPO was based on Bridgette Helms robot Dark City and Brazil both have Metropolis lookalike cities This is a very good movie Its too bad most movies dont have its originality,9
9,Fritz Langs groundbreaking landmark remains one of the biggest mysteries in the world of cinema How can a movie thatll soon turn  years old still look so disturbingly futuristic?? The screenplay by Thea Von Harbou is still very haunting and courageously assails social issues that are of all ages The world has been divided into two main categories thinkers &amp; workers! If you belong to the first category you can lead a life of luxury above ground but if youre a worker your life isnt worth a penny and youre doomed to perilous labor underground The further expansions and intrigues in the screenplay are too astonishing to spoil so I strongly advise that you check out the film yourself Its essential viewing anyway! Metropolis is a very demanding filmexperience and definitely not always entertaining But as it is often the case with silentcinema classics the respect and admiration youll develop during watching it will widely excel the enjoymentaspect Fritz brutal visual style still looks innovative and few directors since were able to recreate a similarly nightmarish composition of horizontal and vertical lines Many supposedly restored versions have been released over the years in  and  for example but the version is still the finest in my opinion even though that one already isnt as detailed and punctual as Lang intended it Metropolis perhaps is THE most important and influential movie ever made  A Space Odyssey Star Wars and Blade Runner owe their existence or at least their power to it,8
10,Metropolis is my alltime favourite movie so Ive saved this for the last review that I plan to write for this wonderful website IMDb Ive enjoyed sharing my experiences of the movies Ive seen but now Im moving on to other passionsAlthough written by Fritz Langs wife Thea von Harbou Metropolis was originally Langs idea he was inspired by the sight of New Yorks skyscrapers when he sailed to America in  During his American trip he visited the set of The Phantom of the Opera and met Lon Chaney! Too bad the encounter wasnt filmedDespite its epic power Metropolis makes very little sense The two major male characters are a father and son named Freder and Fredersen so why is the one named Freder*sen* the father not son of the one cried Freder? Why does the master of Metropolis deliberately connive to destroy the city that he built? Why is Rotwangs crude little cottage the only preFredersen building that wasnt demolished during the construction of this city? Von Harbous very long and unwieldy novelisation of her script establishes this fact but never explains it How and why did Rotwangs hightech laboratory manage to get constructed BENEATH that cottage without disturbing it?For modern viewers some of the plots incoherence can be blamed on missing footage particularly in American prints The distributors for this films original Stateside release commissioned playwright Channing Pollock to translate the German titles A major subplot of the backstory features a deceased woman named Hel who was married to Rotwang but left him to marry Fredersen and give birth to Freder This unseen womans name could not easily be changed for the American version due to a couple of shots of her memorial engraved with the Teutonic name HEL Apparently Pollock feared that American viewers would be offended by this words similarity to Hell so he simply excised the entire subplot from this long movieThe reallife drama on the set of Metropolis mustve been quite interesting in itself Mad scientist Rotwang alias Doctor Strangeglove is played by actor Rudolf KleinRogge who had been married to scenarist von Harbou before she left him to marry Fritz Lang the mastermind of this film In Metropolis Rotwangs wife left him to marry the master of Metropolis Id love to know how KleinRogge felt about the fact that his reallife marital and sexual situation was the inspiration for key plot elements of this movie  and I wonder how KleinRogge felt about knowing that the entire cast and crew knew this as wellMost astonishing about this gargantuan production is the fact that nearly all of Metropolis was actually built to scale with just a couple of miniaturesTrivia tidbit actress Brigitte Helm was cast in the dual female role largely because she was flatchested and therefore she could easily fit inside the mechanical suit for the Robotrix A more busty actress would have suffered constant discomfort inside those galvanised bosoms of the metal costume I learnt this more than  years ago from an eldery Austrian stagehand who worked on the filmFor all its flaws Metropolis will always be my favourite movie Ive enjoyed writing all these reviews for IMDb The joy of posting my reviews on this site has brought me many friendships and a few enemies Well you cant win em allNitrate film stock doesnt last forever and all good things come to a happy ending This is my last review here Ill keep watching movies but other passions are important to me as well Thank you IMDb and thank you to everyone who has read my reviews I will happily rate Metropolis a full  out of ,10
11,One definitely cant fault the breadth and ambition of Fritz Langs vision even if as always with depictions of the future there are a few forgivable blind spots The cars that swarm up and down the multiple levels of Metropolis are unmistakably the standard models of the s as are the flyingmachines that buzz about them; while the business dress of tomorrows rulers unlike their exotic leisure wear doesnt appear to have advanced one iota!HGWells criticised the film for its adherence to arty image over scientific rigour and as a piece of coherent science fiction its certainly as lacking as he claimed The machines exist to appear awesome and to torment their workers rather than to perform any apparent task and there is no explanation of how this society functions how it evolved or how it is sustained let alone of the incongruities that must surely lie behind such anomalous locations as the catacombs and the cathedral But Wells own futuristic film Things to Come conceived in direct riposte to Langs unscientific approach is tedious and talky as a result didactic in its heavyfooted philosophy and explanations and lacking in artistic vision Metropolis may be soft SF but its approach undoubtedly makes for better cinemaI am not however impressed by it as a film Masterpiece of Modernism it may be  but great design and special effects cant save todays bigbudget clunkers from deficiencies of character and plot and they dont save this one Ironically I suspect that its reputation has benefited greatly from its being the only silent film many of its viewers have ever encountered reading through the IMDb pages I see wellmeaning comments like Great  when you consider how primitive cinema was in  and once you get used to the fact that it takes about ten gestures to convey one sentence It wasnt  and it doesnt!As silent films go this is in many places agonizingly slow and repetitious marred by clumsy acting tendentious titles and overwrought gestures By the late s cinema had progressed far beyond this laboured pantomime in Langs case the heavy stylisation may have been a deliberate choice but compared to the fluidity of contemporaries such as Sjostroms The Wind or The Scarlet Letter Asquiths Underground or Shooting Stars and Murnaus Sunrise the film comes across as ten years behind the times The problem is not necessarily with the actors  Brigitte Helm as has been observed does an excellent job in differentiating her two characters  but with the direction and pacingWe saw the restored version with the original Gottfried Huppertz score; the latter didnt always seem to fit too well with pops jumps and awkward silences but this was I assume due either to the difficulty of fitting it to allow for the missing material or to problems in the projection booth when running a newlyarrived print for the first time However the painstaking summary of the various missing scenes only ended up increasing my appreciation of what a good job had been done in the editingdown in the first place! To take a single example where the edited version conveys Freders sudden recollection that he is supposed to be the workers longawaited mediator via the simple juxtaposition of three shots  the shiftchange whistle announcing the meeting the catacombs and Freder suddenly struck by an idea and rushing off  the restoration betrays the fact that a couple of scenes of mimed dialogue were originally provided to spell out the message at painstaking lengthIt is interesting to see how it was done but most of the cuts are either an improvement or a very clever abridgement and by and large I didnt feel that what was omitted had been any great loss In fact frankly I felt that the film was in need of further editing at certain points such as Rotwangs pursuit of Maria through the catacombs She screams and runs and screams and runs and is pursued by a searchlight effect; its clever selfconsciously clever the first couple of times but the repetition becomes tedious to the point of caricature Plot infelicities abound in increasing numbers culminating in the infamous Hunchback of Notre Damestyle ending where the mad scientist carries off the girl across the roof of the cathedral hotly pursued by Our Hero which raised giggles in a hitherto serious and respectful audience with which I couldnt help but sympathiseThis is a film to see once in a lifetime so that you can say that you have seen it  not least because most of the impact lies in the visuals But its all surface and no substance the characters act arbitrarily the plot is subservient to the Message the pacing is like treacle the storytelling technique is primitive and really all it has going for it is the visual flair and the special effects I quite honestly believe that this work would be better appreciated as a set of stills in a glossy brochure; an exhibit in a design exhibition This is not cinema as I love it  its innovative it may be Art but as an actual film its only a poor shadow,6
12,There can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator This is the predominant theme of Metropolis and director Fritz Lang finds numerous ways to say and visualize his message during the course of the film The movie relies on repeated visual imagery to make its point and does so effectively even if tedious at times Particularly effective is the representation of the worker society as an almost single living unit moving trance like to their appointed time and task The use of a ten hour clock in the workers chamber constantly draws our attention as does the hangdog posture of the individual slaves who grind out their workday as if in a dazeAmid this rabble worker Maria Brigitte Helm is the inspirational voice of the workers offering hope for a brighter future by a mediator yet to appear However the Master of Metropolis John Frederson Alfred Abel sees in her a way to quell the underlying frustration of the workers commissioning his scientist Rotwang to create a robot Maria to plant discord among the workers Rotwangs laboratory would have done Frankenstein proud and the creation of the robot is a marvel of cinematic imagery The robot Marias belly dance transforms into a scene of such raw energy and sexual awareness that it awakens the statues of the Seven Deadly Sins one of the master strokes of this expressionist filmSo much imagery in fact is layered into Metropolis that its safe to say that repeat viewings will lead to even more interpretations of its vision and not simply for its denunciation of a class society Both timely and timeless the film captures a dynamism that inspires passion even after nearly eighty years following its original release,8
13,I really hate it when I dont enjoy a classic film I really want to enjoy it but I just cant I want to understand some peoples love for it but I just cant Metropolis falls under this category An unbearably slow film I watched the restoration which is over  hours longthat may have been a bad idea that starts off with interesting ideas but then seems to not really do much with them It is the year  the wealthy rule the city of Metropolis while the lowerclass work for hours on end underground in awful conditions The Master of Metropolis is Joh Fredersen Alfred Abel and his son is Freder Gustav Frohlich who spends his days with other rich people in a place called the pleasure garden where he truly does nothing at all A woman named Maria Brigitte Helm brings a group of working children up for a visit in pleasure garden and Freder is quickly enamored by Maria Freder decides to explore the underground part of the city only to be shocked as an explosion goes off and kills multiple workers He reports this to his father who is disappointed his son was the first to report it over his assistant Josepha Theodor Loos and his assistant is quickly fired This does an immediate job of showing the coldness of Joh but they never do much else with his character In fact very little of the characters are developed in anyway Most of them are completely uninteresting and the setting itself is compelling at first but quickly loses anything interesting halfway through the film as the film moves at a snail pace Anyways the main aspect of the plot here is that the workers are led by Maria to stop this feud between the rich and the poor with nonviolence and the eventual arrival of a mediator to make it happen My real issue is that the film starts with such a great idea and had potential to become something like  Im aware it came out afterwords and that its a novel but still just an example but it instead becomes filled with strange religious allusions and becomes a witch hunt essentially by the end They never really do any decent social commentary at all If any at all This wouldnt matter if the film was actually entertaining but it only is in spurts and then quickly becomes a repetitive bore I do think the special effects were impressive and this film is obviously important for being the first full length science fiction filmwell ever That doesnt mean it holds up because it doesnt In fact itd be hard for me to believe the film was entertaining in  I still wonder if I had watched the shorter version of the film how much more I wouldve enjoyed the film It certainly wouldve have been paced better considering so much of this film is unbelievably uninteresting But I dont think that changes the fact that this movie doesnt really do anything It isnt entertaining It doesnt really have a message What is this movie? I guess good special effects for ? Whatever Im glad I gave this classic a chance but I highly doubt Ill revisit it anytime soon,4
14,This review contains Spoilers But since the story is by far the least reason to watch Metropolis feel free to still read it even if you havent watched it yetMetropolis is a film that was far ahead of its time It influenced a great lot of sciencefiction films and how The Blade Runner Batman or Dark City would look like if there wasnt Metropolis  who knows Even The Matrix Reloaded is heavily inspired by this classic that is as old as my grandmother Now what is it all about? About Freder the son of the head of the city of Metropolis a Christlike figure who falls in love with the preacher of the working class a saintlike woman who happens to be named Maria When a robot who is modeled to look like Maria makes the workers almost extinguish their city and their children Maria and Freder save the children and in the end Freder makes his father and the workers cooperate for a brighter futureSounds silly to you? Yes and thats exactly what the story is silly Thats also the reason why still today Metropolis isnt accepted as the masterpiece it is by a few film buffs But these people dont understand one thing A good film does more than only tell a story A film can be great even without a story at all and a silly story combined with amazing visuals can make you forget all the other weaknesses a film has And wow what amazing images Metropolis offers What an art direction! What wonderful special effects! And remember as I already said this film is as old as my grandmother! Just have a look at the workers They hardly ever seem to be individuals In the mass scenes they look like one big creature moving forward or backwards When they are working they look more like machines than like human beings whereas the machines resemble monsters more than they do technical devices best seen in the moments when Freder hallucinates and sees the big machine as a workereating Moloch We also see a worker and later Freder work on a machine that looks like a clock with  blinking light bulbs doing some that looks as exhausting as it looks senseless Or think of Rotwang the mad inventor who lives in a little hut that looks in this film like it was from another world He has a black prosthesis for his right hand its not a coincidence that Stanley Kubrick gave his mad scientist/inventor Dr Strangelove a prosthesis for his right hand too He builds the robot that he makes to look like Maria and that transformation scene is one of the most magnificent scenes ever and looks more convincing than some scenes of modern scifi flicks I also have to mention Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and the robot  and the look in her eyes would already be enough to tell which of her characters is on screen at the moment If something like awards already would have been given in the s she sure would have walked home with quite a bunch of them And just look at her sexy dance! It is just as memorable as the shot of the many eyes watching her dance  or the many faces watching her preach just a few minutes later Metropolis is a film no scififan should miss I had the good luck that my first viewing of Metropolis one year ago was in a cinema when it was a rereleased after its restoration I can only recommend you to watch it in a cinema if you have the possibility to as Metropolis is just as   A Space Odyssey one of those rare films that are masterpieces on your TV set but a revelation on the big screen,10
15,I was very anxious to see Metropolis for the first time I had been into silent movies for a couple of years but hadnt had the opportunity to see Fritz Langs classic I finally saw it at a silent movie theater in Hollywood and my feelings were to say the least mixedThe film is visually stunning Monumental sets brilliantly directed scenes amazing special effects by the standards of the time In fact I might say that I was more enthralled by the visual effects of this movie than I was by say Lord of the Rings or Avatar Whereas Cameron and Jackson used CGI to make their visions come true; Lang had to use camera trickery paint and woodThis movie no doubt set the lexicon for the SciFi and blockbuster genre in stone The images of Metropolis have been repeated in innumerable movies The scene of the underground city being flooded has curious similarities to James Camerons Titanic Even the villainous Rotwang can be seen in the characters Dr Strangelove and Doc Brown from Back to the FutureBut then theres the story And the dialogue And the acting which is overwrought even by the standards of the time But I dont have enough room to go into thatStarting with the opening line LookThese are your brothers a violent cringe would run through my body every time the intertitles would appearThe later line about the head and hands needing the heart as mediator caused a huge outburst of laughter in the theater This serves as the basis for the moral of the story which was eerily similar to How the Grinch Stole Christmas Essentially it can boiled down to this Somebody according to writer Thea von Harbous later beliefs this turned out to be Adolf Hitler needs to appeal to the hearts of capitalist managers and tell them to be nice to their workers The outcome is a grudging handshake between the head manager Joh Frederson and the leader of the workers Grot; and thus begins a shining new day!Metropolis also incorporates religious symbolism which is to say the very least heavyhanded Scenes of the Seven Deadly Sins The Tower of Babel an altar to Moloch and the Flood all warn of doom to decadent societies that exploit the weak and kill the righteousIn the end this muddled mixture of Socialist calls for justice and Christian Apocalypticism creates a political message that Lang himself described as sillyI recommend this film for its artistic brilliance and groundbreaking techniques But dont go into this expecting an award quality filmIf you want to get into silent film this is a relatively easy one to get start with However I dont know if thats a good or a bad thing Ive met too many people whove said that Metropolis was the best silent movie theyve ever seen; which probably means that it was the only one that they ever bothered to watch I would recommend Sunrise or City Lights as a first over this,5
16,Francis Ford Coppola once said that Apocalypse Now wasnt just about Vietnam is was Vietnam In a similar way Metropolis isnt just about the Twentieth Century it is the Twentieth Century Almost every image in it reflects or more often predicts the realities of life in the West over the past hundred years in a way that is truly uncannyFrom small details  the traffic jams and blackouts that plague city dwellers  to major historical events  the climactic flood predicts every industrial disaster that has destroyed the lives of thousands of workers from Chernobyl to the Bhopal disaster whilst Fredersens vision of workers being fed to Moloch cant help but bring to mind the holocaust  Metropolis feels prescient in any number of ways In the image of the Manhattan skyline Lang really did find the perfect symbol of the coming century  progressive new faceless oppressiveThis is far from the simple Marxist fable it is often taken for  although the Socialist message can hardly be ignored Its also a Christian parable Maria flanked by crosses is counterbalanced by the Machine brought to life under a pentagram informed by the book of Revelation; a retelling of the Orpheus myth with Freder as Orpheus and Maria as Eurydice lost in the underworld; and a Kafkaesque nightmare of depersonalisation although the Gothic expressionistic production design is a long way from Kafkas more sterile styleIts also lest we forget a silly adventuremelodrama with a mad scientist an evil twin a bad father with a noble son and an impossibly virtuous idealised heroine In many ways it anticipates Star Wars in dressing up mythic standards with Science Fiction tropes  with Fredersen as the misguided King Freder as the handsome Prince Maria the goodhearted peasants daughter Rotwang as a scheming sorcerer and the Machine as the wicked witch appropriately burnt at the stake by the villagersThe MachineMan a confusing name for a construction so obviously feminine is the single most indelible image of the film; the scene in which Rotwang brings her to life for the first time is a real moment of magic and awe untarnished by eighty subsequent years of cinematic showmanship Even better is the scene in which she becomes a duplicate of Maria  such an obvious influence on James Whales Frankenstein that its hard not to shout out Its alive! The optical effects are years ahead of their time certainly the best of their kind until the sixties at least It also marks the beginning of Brigitte Helms truly extraordinary turn as the false MariaThis is only the third silent film Ive seen after Nosferatu and The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and its taken me a while to acclimatise to the acting style which can seem close to parody What it really reminds me of however is modern dance which similarly seeks to communicate with the audience visually rather than verbally Metropolis encourages this comparison with the highly choreographed movements of the workers operating the machinery Bearing this in mind Helm is hugely impressive in multiple roles Maria could be a rather dull and virtuous heroine she enters the film surrounded by poor children in rags but Helm invests her with enormous energy and expressiveness It helps that the script allows her to take an unusually proactive role for a female character organising workers meetings and racing to the rescue of the endangered children However it is her performance as bad Maria vamping up a storm that lingers in the memory  the twitching jerking movements of her head and body the Anne Robinson style halfwink that changes the shape of her face that malicious little grin that makes it hard not to root for her mischief The entirely weird erotic dance that she performs isnt technically very good or erotic but it is utterly unforgettable Subtextually shes the Whore of BabylonThe other performances are mainly very good particularly Alfred Abel as Fredersen proving that it is possible to underplay in a silent film Only Rudolf KleinRogge hits any wrong notes  difficult as it undoubtedly must be to play a mad scientist in a silent film with subtlety some of his more unrestrained gesticulations leave you worried about the safety of the other actorsUltimately though it all inevitably comes back to the imagery Langs film remains unmatched even today Pick a scene any scene  the synchronised shuffling crowds at the shift change; our first sighting of the Metropolis all biplanes skyscrapers and suspended motorways; the vision of Moloch; the MachineMan awakening; Maria pursued along a pitchblack tunnel by a beam of light; the statue of Death coming to life in the Cathedral; disembodied eyes entranced by the twitching false Maria; the crowds swarming up the steps in the Tower of Babel section; the lifts crashing down one by one; desperate children crowding around Maria as the floodwaters close in; and most of all false Maria laughing as she burns on her pyre then transforming back to her metal visage No film before or since matches this for spectacle And if in order to appreciate it you have to swallow a little treacle about the heart being the mediator between head and hands well trust me its worth it,9
17,We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Langs Metropolis are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upperclass and operated by slavelike poor The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan These elements can be found in this films ancestors Frankenstein Batman Gattaca and the cities of Blade Runner Star Wars and The Fifth Element All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Langs workMetropolis has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes After its success in  the film has had an uneasy time Its pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in  Unless a lost version surfaces as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentinos  film Beyond the Rocks the complete work my never be seen again The restored version released on DVD in  was based on a digital restoration at K resolution from all available sources Its the best version that Ive seen and I would highly recommend that one if you havent seen the film The worst is a  print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration the film in grainy and difficult to see it doesnt even have a soundtrack I call that one the worst because Im still a little ambivalent about the  restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting good sound effects not so good and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy Freddy Mercury Bonnie Tyler Adam Ant and Pat Benatar yuck!Those who study the film myself included find the story impenetrable Some films you can easily decipher but Metropolis has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that its hard to pin it down as a whole Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the films chaotic nature It takes place in the future restored versions offer title cards that suggest that its the year  but I dont go by that in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers the Gothic sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives dancing in their penthouses and spending their money The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step They dont so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses slaves building his pyramids The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another One person that isnt ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his officeHis son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the workers children Curious he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there The woman is Maria a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be foundFreder uncovers a plot by Rotwang the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms This leads to the films most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzyThen all Hell breaks loose but the rest I must leave to you to discoverLang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film and therefore less successful the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers At one point Freder disguised as a worker witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen Another suggests an odd device a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around its edge The machine doesnt seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless dayThe film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism astonishing in its use of light and shadow One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in Another brilliant moment comes with Marias erotic dance as the men gawk the camera filled with their moist eyes This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home videoOther moments have deeper resonance There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves Walking to work they march with their heads down dressed in uniforms and caps It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler More obvious are Langs biblical references The rise of the city parallels Marias retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel The giant pentagram in Rotwangs lab as he plays God The breathtaking image of the plaguebringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself There is even a Christlike quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakersThese elements and images are brought to the film because of Langs insistence on no less then absolute perfection He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster working his cast and crew like a dictator He cast some  extras  of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone and worked them from morning till night The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with himI could go on and on this film all great films invite lengthy discussions It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over But when you get down to it the best way to view Metropolis is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of its time Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad,0
18,This truly is a classic masterpiece and honestly one of the best movies ever made The story is brilliant and the visuals amazingI have seen the German  minutes version of the movie without subtitles Yes its a long watch but its worth every second of it Basically only reason why the movie is so long is because they need about ten hand gestures to speak one sentence Its kind of dreadful to look at first but once youre used to it it shouldnt trouble you anymoreIn many ways this movie can be regarded as the Blade Runner of the s Metropolis is set in a futuristic world that has a same kind of atmosphere as in Blade Runner The mix of s cars and propellerplanes with futuristic machines highways buildings and androids is very unusual but an absolutely awesome thing to look at The movie was ahead of its time and in some ways also propheticThe story is absolutely the best thing of the movie Also the way the story is told and directed by Fritz Lang deserves credit The story is tense and has quite some symbolism layers and storylines but remains always easy to follow The ending is truly spectacular and tense The way how spectacular and tense the ending and the entire movie in general was really surprised me in a positive wayThe sets are obviously fake and miniatures at times but they still manage to convince and impress Further more the movie is filled with some fantastic and very convincing early special effectsMan who also deserves credit is Alfred Abel Wow what a great actor he was in this movieAn absolute must see and one of the best movies of all time/http//bobafettblogspotcom/,10
19,MetropolisMetropolis is one of the most exciting and exceptional works of art that humankind has produced This epic science fiction film is one of Germanys famous silent movies created by Fritz Lang and liberated in  the period between the two World WarsThis movie represents the expressionist cinema and shows us the repression of human needs by the machine age Langs creation of a selfdestructive society is a protest against the machine age Metropolis is one of the most magnificent cities of  is kept alive by the unceasing work of the underground people who live in slavery and is enjoyed by wealthy and educated people The Austrian director of the movie Fritz Lang presents the story of a master John Federsen who sees people as machines working constantly to maintain the luxury and technology of his metropolis On the other side his son Freder falls in love with one of the underground workers who is a spiritual leader for the slaves The son recognizes the unsentimental heart of his father and starts a revolution The city gets flooded and Maria Freders love regains the workers trust after a robot had stolen her identity she finds her loved one after saving the citys children and the workers shake hands with the masterExpressionism tries to simplify the world and to understand it emotionally in a subjective way It is very important to understand this definition of this dynamic violent and distorted movement in order to understand that Lang tried to externalize his own internal vision of the world through simple expressions The name metropolis comes from the Greeks and means mothercity It has this significance because a metropolis is the biggest form of a technologically and economically developed city Nevertheless referring to the movie name this film can be considered as the mother city of all cinematic clichés In this story there are two main characters Maria and Freder These two characters are also the heroes of the story because they are the ones who rescue the population from being drowned in the flood John Federson is a person full of empowering feelings who only thinks of himself and of his city forgetting about the ones who work for him All the fantasies that he has come true through the power of his workers but he never thinks about the danger they are in while working for him This man wants so much power that he is almost hypnotized by it; he is obsessed and possessed by the power of inventions and creationsOn the other hand Maria is just a symbol of munificence her soul is pure and she is seen like an angel who brings peace to the world Maria convoys the people in a church settling area She is shown as sanctity a holy person that is surrounded by the light of the candles She is positioned higher than the workers who carefully listen to her as she speaks about peace unity and their salvation by a mediator that will soon come Her eyes inspire confidence and kindness as she kisses Freder in the church scene In general all she does is for the good of humanity One thing that she repeats in the movie is Between the head and hands there must be a heart  This means that she realizes the bad things that the head John Frederson does and the good things that the hands workers do But she knows that these workers should not be treated poorly or like robots and that she can be the heart which can persuade the head and the hands to cooperate to come to common interests Maria as her name suggests is also a biblical motif She explains to the workers the story of the Tower of Babel The workers in the story destroy this tower which parallels how the movie will end with the destruction of the machines by the workforce Maria is still the representation of Jesus mother because she is trying to save the lives of the underground children She would sacrifice herself and alike Mother Mary she has a strong faith in the creator of the world All the scenes of this film are perfectly created at the eye level so that anyone is able to view the action However there is also a birds eye view at the beginning of the movie as the panorama of the city is shown from high above the ground This view was created to give us an impression of how widely extended and huge Metropolis is In addition the focus of the dramatic camera angles with bold shadows is on the disproportioned landscape as well as on the rightangled buildings There are moments in which the camera focuses on fast movement scenes like the dancing of the robot in the nightclub and scenes where it focuses on slow movement like in the beginning of the film where the slaves are shown going into the working area at a certain pace and aligned as robots When more people are involved in a scene like the one in which all the children are surrounding Maria as she rings the danger bell the angles are vertical triangular but when only one person is focused there is a closeup to allow us to read that characters expressions and feelings A good example would be the closeups on the master Fredersons eyes as he asks his secretary why his son was allowed to go underground and as well after that scene when he is thinking in order to suggest this dictators meditation and frustration Another important aspect of the camera and of Expressionism that I have remarked was the scene in which the mad scientist tries to run away from Freder and kidnaps Maria He is walking up on the roof of a sharpangled building holding Maria under his arm as if nothing would happen The same scene was notable in Robert Wienes film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari as Cesare walks up on the roof with the kidnapped fiancé and the city crowd follows himTime also is significant in the film because the clock keeps showing up in the most important scenes Time is evident in Fredersons office as his son challenges him to have mercy for the people as well as he is talking to his secretary Still only a small portion of the clock is shown in these shots and it means the time in which the master can think what decisions to take On the other hand a gigantic clock is shown as Freder finds an exhausted worker trying to turn a wallclock Freder understands the struggle of this man and replaces him There is where he finds out that at  pm Maria will have a meetingBut all that we have seen in this movie is not only made to show us the great importance of this silent SF film that can keep the watcher alive by its impressive music and can inspire contemporary movies like Matrix  but for its great historical importance Fritz Lang expressed a social life in this movie as well as a political one After WWI when Germany had lost a war peoples lives were a disaster Everyone was disoriented and could not keep up with the tragedy that was going on and maybe there were some influences of the great antiSemitism that was supposed to follow But Germany was a great disaster as well and there was nothing it could have done to prevent it because many troubles kept adding up over the years and this country had to be defeated morally and politically as well as economically Even if Germanys wish of reconstruction was as utopic as Fredersens wish of a technological city the postwar inflation had a big contribution on cinemas development,0
20,I typically dont like silent films but I decided to watch this one for two reasons  First I usually like scifi movies and second Metropolis had received so many glowing reviews that I couldnt pass it up  However my opinion of this film is below what most reviewers have been sayingKinos digitally remastered version on DVD is very impressive  The sound and picture quality are both excellent  However I have to conclude that favorable reviews of this film are likely based on nostalgia on the films influence on future films and on the incredible visual effects given its year of release  Film history buffs and silent film fans should see this movie  I thought this was a good film but not a great one  A rating of  is much too high and at # there are plenty of better films ranked below itFirst the good parts of the film  The special effects are excellent for a pres film  The mindlessness of the working class is portrayed well in how they work the decisions they make and in how easily they are led/misled  The main character is well developed throughout the film and the audience can relate to him well  The film is visually stunning and impressive  The story of the working class vision of the future machinemen etc have had a very strong influence on many films which came later,4
21,For its time this movie has stunning visuals kind of Kubrickesqe in appearance especially the opening scenes of workers going and coming from work Its very strange with the group leaving walking with their heads down like zombiesThe set designs in here are also something that might draw your attention This really has a futuristic look I thought the visuals were fascinating This was German expressionist filmwork at its height I would think Director Fritz Lang went on to become a very famous man in his profession This wasnt his first effort but I think this might have been the film that put him on the map so to speak Several years later he gained a lot more fame with M At any rate with the photography sets and overall Flash Gordontype scifi look this must have been a real eyeopener to movies viewers  years ago I still think they look very cool today The music was also very dramatic at least in this restored  surround sound restoration DVD put out by KlinoObviously the eye makeup on men and the exaggerated motions by actors in silent films look a little hokey but I was mesmerized by Brigitte Helm who plays Maria and her evil clone She is something else! I also appreciated Klinos explanation of lost footage and how they did the best they could do to still make the story flow together They did an outstanding job I wouldnt attempt to watch this on anything less than this DVD which looks pretty darn goodThis is a worker story about a man wanting to trade his comfortable life to join the oppressed workers who do their thing beneath the earth in Metropolis Workers are seen as nothing but replaceable robots If someone gets hurt they get carted away and replaced immediately but some other zombielike human Of course people being mistreated can only take it for so long before rebellion Thats history from the days of the Jewish slaves in Egypt to today so thats part of this story too I wont say more to ruin itI dont want to mislead people on one major point todays audiences watching this Few people in  watch silent movies To ask them to sit through two hours of a silent film is obviously asking a lot I had to break this up into several viewings myself but thats okay I still enjoyed itbut it a silent movie this long is not easy to sit through You have to be a student of film or a big film buff to watch thisbut those people will be rewarded Over  reviews in here show you this film has enough to offer or at least take a look Now that this restored version is available check it out!,7
22,OK first of all Im not some kind of actionjunkie who thinks that the Rambotrilogy is the best movies of all time I am a person who think that other silents like Nosferatu and The Battleship Potemkin are entertainingAlthough I loved the previous movies referred to I thought this was one of the most dull movies ever As entertainment this movie cant go very far On a scale rating its abilities to entertain it gets a / from meAs a milestone in the history of movies it goes all the way to the top The special effects were great to have been made almost  years ago The editing was great It must have been one of the most expensive movie made to that date On the scale of how important a chapter in the cinematic history this is I will rate it a / That means a total / This also means that you should rather check out really good silents like Chaplins Modern Times Eisensteins The Battleship Potemkin and Murnaus Nosferatu,8
23,Fritz Lang was constantly experimenting with ways to tell stories by way of the visual medium and his  opus Metropolis is the cream of the crop of examples of this Perhaps it was seeing the film in the greatest possible format a fully restored print on the KINO DVD filled with intertitles to keep the story complete that had me appreciate it more but even if I had seen the film on a scratchy print or with not very appropriate music ie Giorgio Moroders experimental cut it would still be affecting At the core of the story Lang and his collaborator Thea von Harbou the sides of good vs evil or at least the complete lack of understanding of the powerful over the weak is set up so strongly that even when it has its fairytale type of heaviness to it it doesnt seem to feel compromised in strength or relevance for adults This is the kind of film that should work for anyone young and old as it deals with universal themes ie The mediator between Head and Hands must be the Heart!The story leaves room for the visual style to come through Freder is the son of a kind of Imperial man over the workers who die for the machines of Metropolis Joh Frederson He feels the sorrow and pain of the people and goes down to their level to be one of them He falls in love with the most compassionate and angelic of women Maria played by the beautiful Brigitte Helm in multiple roles she plays without a fault who succumbs to capture after the jealously of Freders father Enter the robot a marvel of a mad scientist who gets transposed from Maria and becomes the havocwrecker of the part of Metropolis I wont reveal too much of the story except to mention that as a foreshadowing for Freder for the last act as he wakes up in one scene the Book of Revelations sits in his lapAmidst in all of this Metropolis is a masterpiece of visual effects cameratricks and of course editing if I wouldnt quite rank Metropolis in my alltime top ten favorites I would rank it in terms of the editing and pacing Lang uses which is apparent even in a permanently truncated version It starts off with the image of the machine transposed over steam and then soon moves to a vision of a city that was not far off from how it is in present day cars moving on roads built to the sky airplanes flying everywhich way and mammoth skyscrapers built in extravagant ways But its not just the use of the models or the sets or the backdrops or even the use of space and atmosphere in most of Langs shots which are all spectacular its also the use of light that really caught my attention throughout the film One thing I remember still days after seeing the film is the use of one spotlight on the character of Maria in a suspense scene it also appears in other scenes I think Its little things like that which make as big an impact as the montages the superimpositions of faces and eyes in the dreamlike shotsAnd of course Langs greatest innovation with the film is that in telling a futuristic story he goes beyond his time period in stylizing As I mentioned with the pacing being unique it was surprising though maybe not as much from seeing his classic M that many of the suspense sequences mob scenes/riots chases I knew that this is the same kind of styling thats used today for many of the most modern of sciencefiction/action films In its own way much like Stanley Kubricks  Space Oddysey it breaks the mold of conventional forms of storytelling while not completely abandoning the storytelling form Although Metropolis has a checkered history of being cut down by countries and it hasnt been seen in its full form in almost eighty years what remains doesnt seem at all dated or crude Quite the opposite its visual expressiveness its use of time and character and action and its deliberate pacing makes it ahead of its time and influential and at the same time keeping itself unique Its a tale were all familiar with being the tale of love and compassion coming into play in an industrial cruel world which Im sure was even more relevant to post WW Germany at the time filmed with a mix of overthetop melodrama megabudget setpieces and designs that confound the senses Add the appropriate music and youve got a classic fantasy A tremendous film to see two three a dozen times over though some of those too impatient for films without spoken words or by the operatic dramatic side of it all may become disappointed or frustrated,10
24,For many years the initially flopped and consequently butchered Metropolis Fritz Lang made in the mid twenties of the past century could be appreciated at least for its qualities as the indispensable sciencefiction trailblazer in motion picture history What was severely lacking from the plot however finally emerged on screen again after the famous Buenos Aires reel find which brought a quarter of what was missing from the film back from the dead With the new painstaking  restoration effort also came a grandiose symphony orchestra studio recording of the original Gottfried Huppertz score  and the results make movie buffs prone to be blown away and this time for realThe technical brilliance and visual lavishness of Fritz Langs oeuvre was always undisputed already at its time and only matched by fellow German Murnaus ingenious approaches on filmmaking Theres so much and dense imagery that generations of future filmmakers would draw from this newly emerging archetype Among the unforgettable scenes are the giant heart machine which turns into a moloch in one of the heros visions the Babel tower teeming with utopian life the enormous sets elevators and masses and masses of enslaved and rebellious people the staggering creation of the first robot all set against the dominant dichotomy between  literally  those living above and those dying below There are echoes of communism here of nazi ideology of the dangers and abysses of industrialization technology and there are also glimpses of humanity Not perfect in all its components the film nevertheless has everything pioneering in it  and more Fritz Lang while having some reservations himself referred to the picture as a signpost for new destinations and thats exactly what it became now that we can look at the great scifi pictures of the past century In them and through them Metropolis still lives and once we revisit the original again we might yet be surprised that it miraculously still points ahead,10
