0,Frank Capras idealistic outlook on life is evident in his films From It Happened One Night to Its a Wonderful Life Capra has always had a tendency to let the little guy rise above it all and beat the odds It is no small wonder that Capra enjoyed much of his success during the Depression when movies were used to truly pull an audience out of the despair of the s into a world where anything can happen where being a nice person is all you need to succeed While the fact that the country was in the middle of the Depression was not completely ignored an overly optimistic view on life was taken to counter the despair of everyday lifeThere were many points in It Happened One Night where the true state of the country was indicated Homeless people hitching rides on trains seemed perfectly normal Rather than regard them with apprehension and pity you smile and wave at them Another example is the hostile reaction proprietor Zekes wife had to the fact that her husband had let Peter and Ellie stay the night with promises of being paid Upon seeing Peter and Ellies car missing they rush to the cottage to see if Peter and Ellie are still there They cannot afford freeloadersIn another scene a childs mother has passed out from hunger because they have no money to buy food Peter and Ellie have nearly depleted their funds but decide that the mother and child need money more than they do and give some to themDespite these instances the movie was altogether cheerful in its depiction of the world In the throes of the stock market crash this movie signaled the birth of the screwball comedy At a time when the country needed release they could find that release and laughter in movies like It Happened One Night Audiences were amused by scenes in the film such as the segment in which Peter teaches Ellie how to dunk a donut Or when forced to share a room Peter puts a blanket between his and Ellies beds and calls it the `wall of Jericho which is revisited when the walls of Jericho come tumbling down after Peter and Ellies marriage Probably the most famous scene in the film is the hitchhiking sequence which features Peter standing by the roadside trying to thumb a ride unsuccessfully finally giving up after more than a dozen cars speed by without paying any heed to his attempts After he gives up beaten Ellie simply lifts her skirt above her knee The first car that passes stops as we see extreme closeups of a foot slamming down on the brakes and a hand applying the hand brakeA master in his profession Capra left his mark on the films he directed With an almost childlike cheerfulness he maintains a sense of dignity and class The viewer is left with a feeling of hope for humankind even if its only that a persons ideals could be used to make such a film Capras films are still regarded as masterpieces It Happened One Night arguably remains to this day unparalleled in screwball comedies It was one of many movies made during the Depression a sometimes sad and even lonely time in our history It gave its audience a chance to escape and forget their troubles for a few moments in time out of  stars,9
1,In his autobiography The Names Above the Title Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters the hero the heroine the comedian and the villainWhat Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films the characters of hero and comedian are combined Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself especially with that system all her own But in doing what he did for Clark Gables character Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the moldCapras autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio along the lines of Republic or Monogram As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it Capra also had a stroke of good luck Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day drunk as a skunk is priceless Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldnt have been more cooperativeAt some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day So the publicity drums were beatThe rest as they say is history It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam Best Picture Best Director Best Actor and Best Actress It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios And it set the standard for screwball comedyThe film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert Theyre together for most of the film so if it doesnt click between the two of them you have people walking out in droves Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in Gable and Colbert did only one other film together Boom Town for MGM You cant get much more different than those two films Boom Town had a huge MGM budget Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein Its also a great film but its not a classic like It Happened One Night,10
2,It Happened One Night directed by Frank Capra was made and released in  by Columbia Pictures as a small budget film that was not expected to do well at the box office Yet after its release the film gained many accolades and won the Academy Award for best picture in  Due to the original small nature of the film the leading man role was surprisingly filled by Clark Gable who was on loan from another studio He stared opposite of Claudette Colbert Capras film was a combination of many ideals emotions and social perceptions of the American society of the thirties but it was also a combination of many new and innovative filming techniques and sound advancements The film unfolds the story in such a attentiongrabbing and remarkable way that most of todays cinema use his style and ideals when producing and creating films Capra used the idea of a moving camera one that was not fixed upon a box but on a moveable crane instead This produced more sweeping shots more angles for filming and fewer distance shots It allowed for more movement of the actors as well as a more realistic and real life feeling to the movie The film also incorporates back projection of images This is were a scene is filmed previously and played in the background while the actors perform the scene in front of the projection Back projection is used for car scenes to give the impression that the actors are driving but in reality they are in a sound stage Capra also incorporated the use of a wipe in his film The technique of moving left to right and fading in or out to change a scene or show elapsed time took the place of the traditional place cards in silent films and allowed for a more constant stream for the film The film was also all talk the new technology of a sound strip on the side of the film was used The text cards of silent films were completely discarded Another camera trick by Capra is to show a change in feelings within Clark Gables character for Claudette Colberts character by depicting her character in a different light This happens two times within the film at key moments to the development of their relationship Claudette Colbert is seen in a close up of softer light to emphasize Clark Gables character seeing her in a `different light In this romantic comedy Capra not only showed new styles and techniques but also addressed social issues of the time Through comedy he showed the outlandish nature of the rich King arriving for his own wedding in a helicopter and the nature of man being the controller in relationships as well as in society The fighting and struggles between the two main characters showed the man taking care of the woman the social norms of how men and woman should act around each other in that era But the fighting and the banter also show a strongminded and intelligent woman The two strongwilled main characters balanced each other outCapras techniques for showing the social relationship between the rich and working classes as well as a relationship between man and woman in the s captured film makers and film viewers for over  years Films are now compared to his style of camera movement and his style of capturing the American ideals When movies of today make a similar statement of achieving what one wants they are referred to as Capraesc Capras imagination and style is one that changed the outlook of American films and introduced a new genre to film goers everywhere,0
3,IHON rightly earns its place as one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history A pioneer of the screwball comedy genre it holds up very well  years after it was madeIts a classic tale of the battle of sexes something that is still so relevant today We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Claudette Colbert who jumps ship from her fathers yacht literally! in Florida after an argument with said father played by Walter Connolly over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley Jameson Thomas without her fathers consent Ellie is on a mission to get to New York to King Westley But how will she do it? Thats how Peter Warne played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable comes into the story Recently fired from his newspaper job Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York and realizing who she is Her story is all over the news after all! offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story to win him back his job And so the fun begins Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances The trip isnt a smooth one and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie which gives us great scenes such as the doughnutdunking lesson Walls Of Jericho and the nowclassic hitchhiking scene The humour is still fresh and fastpaced over  years later Oops I almost forgot the classic no undershirt scene where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses to reveal shock horror! no undershirt but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of mens undershirts which dropped dramatically after the films release One of the first examples of product placement in film Great supporting characters particularly the scenestealing Oscar Shapeley Roscoe Karns Of course it has its faults all early talkies do But any faults are outweighed by the great story Technically it was wellmade for its timeIHON won  Oscars Best Picture Best Director Frank Capra Best Actress and Best Actor for Colbert and Gable and Best Adaptation It deserved all of them Funnily enough both Colbert and Gable didn&amp;#;t want any part in the film at first I bet they changed their viewpoint after the surprise success and the prestigious Academy Awards they gained for it Its been said that a number of Disney characters like Bugs Bunny Yosemite Sam and Pepe LePew were inspired by characters in this film A classic a mustsee a great movie,10
4,This is a pleasant funny classic that shows it age only slightly and that has a lot of scenes you can look forward to each time that you see it Gable and Colbert each get roles that are nicely suited to them and are wellremembered for their performances  The supporting cast also rounds out the picture with some good character actingThe crosscountry trip on the bus and via other assorted methods is fun to watch with several nice vignettes that complement the main story line The atmosphere on the long bus trip is done especially well  The plot is of course not meant to be taken too seriously in itself but it comes in very handy for setting up good characters and comedyIt all comes across as effortlessly entertaining romantic comedy with some classic scenes and characters you learn to care for in spite of their mistakes,0
5,This sweet comedy never loses its appeal  Claudette Colbert is a spoiled young girl who meets a wordly attractive newspaper reporter Clark Gable In the beginning she treats him like a servant but he never knuckles under to this behavior  The interaction between these two is very romantic and humorous  It is the classic portrayal of what may be called sexual tension  He takes care of her  does not take advantage of her  but makes her realize that her wealthy background cannot carry her through as a human being she has to earn his respect by treating him with respect  There is a scene in which the two of them are forced to hitchhike and their breakfast is only a handful of carrots plucked from a garden they were lucky to find  As Gable stands at the edge of the road and Colbert is perched atop a wooden fence his wisecracking posture is said to be the inspiration for the beloved cartoon character Bugs Bunny  This is a mustsee for every one who loves old movies and entertaining for all,10
6,It Happened One Night is one of those films that is so classic and on so many `mustsee lists that I actually assumed that I had seen it at one time or another  It wasnt until I actually looked into the film when I in fact realized I hadntThe first film to sweep the major categories in an Oscar ceremony It Happened One Night spins the story of a young spoiled heiress Colbert who marries a shallow yet dashing aviator  She is then swept off by her father who takes her on a cruise; convinced that time away from each other will cure her infatuation  Instead she escapes by jumping out of the boat and swimming to shore where she begins her journey from Miami to New York where her husband awaits  The film quickly turns into an `on the road flick at this point when she meets up with Clark Gable a down on his luck reporter who offers to help her for the exclusive rights to her story  Mayhem inevitably ensues as one thing after another goes wrong during their adventureIm a little hesitant to completely agree with the general assessment that It Happened One Night is a screwball comedy  Of course there were certain moments that were hilarious and overdone the scene when Gable and Colbert pose as husband and wife to share a cabin for the night is absolutely rich but the majority of the remaining film is clever romantic comedy with fairly even performances by the principles  Perhaps there is a sliding scale for screwball comedies with It Happened One Night being a two and a film that I feel personifies the genre Bringing up Baby as a five,8
7,Consider this It Happened One Night was made in  which gives it the distinction + years later of being the oldest film still widely viewed by mainstream audiences And most of the runnerups for oldest film are s screwball comedies inspired by the success of this seminal film which made a clean sweep of the  Academy Awards The genre has held up over the years because these are small human stories with themes that are still relevant The main reason It Happened One Night worked then and still works today is the accidental pairing of Colbert and Gable who provide an amazing chemistry under Frank Capras direction Columbia Pictures was a small player in the early days of talking pictures and studio head Harry Cohn had difficulty rounding up two major stars to play the leads in this modest budget production Colbert was not interested in doing another Capra film after a negative experience working for him six years earlier in her silent picture debut Cohn told Capra That French broad likes money and Capra finally got her on board with an offer of $ double her usual price and a guarantee that production would only last  days Gable was under contract to MGM but had been making trouble for them so as punishment Louis B Mayer personally loaned him to Columbia for this filmThe film had a lot else going for it; a motivated Capra a great script that would play well with small town America and a good ensemble of supporting talent The story concerns a spoiled young heiress Colbert trying to escape the control of her father nicely played by Walter Connelly Dodging her fathers private detective she takes a Miami to New York bus where she meets a recently fired reporter Gable who agrees to help her in exchange for an exclusive story Cozy quarters and many adventures lead them to change their initial opinions of each other brainless brat and obnoxious bully as an undisclosed affection develops On the eve of their arrival in New York they try to sort out their feelings for each otherWhile the script is not really successful in convincingly illustrating the process of their falling in love one minute they are just friends and the next they are in love Capra is able to sell it with a simple connection process between these two characters which is at work throughout the film As another reviewer has written Far from loveydovey the dialogue is witty sharp and occasionally heartless We may know the outcome but the road to get there is paved with arguments anger and misunderstandings Its also clever funny and a bit risqué for   During their three days and nights together Colbert convincingly gives us a character who matures from a spoiled rich girl to a responsible adult motivated by a desire to improve her companions opinion of her Gable shows real star presence playing a confident charming and resourceful gentleman By the end their sudden love is credible because they have demonstrated that they are both exactly what the other is looking for in a partnerAfter the Oscar ceremony Capra threw a party where he downed a magnum of champagne and passed out on his front lawn clutching his Best Director OscarThen again what do I know? Im only a child,9
8,I have seen this movie a few times over the year and have just recently  viewed it again twice on the DVD version This is a highly recommended  movie on several levels First it has to be seen because it won  multiple academy awards during  It has won at least best actor best actress and best director  So it should be seen just for its historical significance if you are  into movies as an art form However if you are just looking for  entertainment then it is simply a great classic romantic comedy The  set up is that Ellie Claudette Colbert is a rich spoiled  independent woman who is running away from her father in Florida to  join her husband not quite a complete marriage in New York City She  meets Peter Clark Gable on the bus who is a down &amp; out reporter  looking for a big story They join forces in that he will help her to  get to New York for an exclusive on her story In essence it is the  bratty socialite vs the hard nosed know it all reporter  Can they  achieve true love? Just watch the movie and figure it out for  yourself There is the classical scene regarding the battle of the  sexes which involves hitchhiking There is some dated material because  the movie was made in the s about the s This may be both good  and bad as a viewing experience Gable is a bit too shallow as a  desirable character He lacks the sensitivity of a guy that would be in  a modern romantic comedy However his portrayal of Peter is likely  typical for the ideal man of the era in that he attempted to be  competent and in charge at all times the know it all guy The  character comes across as too simplistic by todays standards However  when he gets the feedback on his rough edges from Ellie he shows his  nice guy side Claudette Colbert is great in this movie she had  opportunities to display her acting craft as she responded to different  situations The scene in which she and Gable pretended to be basically  white trash was very funny Her getting the best actress award is  very evident even without having to see the performances of her  rivalries for the Oscar in  Overall this movie is rated a  and  is highly recommended A viewer may avoid older movies because they  lack dept; however hang in for this one Once the screen chemistry  starts between Colbert and Gable their first scene together the rest  of the picture is just a joyride of entertainment in watching these two  work their magic for the camera Enjoy this movie it should be an  awesome experience,0
9,In my college film class we had begun watching It happened one night I was laughing my head off But of course my professor stops the movie right when it was getting good After that I wanted to see this movie so badly My father lucky enough had the movie I watched it and it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen Clark Gable is histerical He really does a great job in the film I always did prefer the old comedies to today Do you blame me? If you watch the flick you will enjoy it This is one of the first romantic comedies Itll send all the others to the back of the bus I would higly recommend this movie Its a classic/,10
10,Released in  Frank Capras It Happened One Night ushered in a new era of Hollywood filmmaking  the screwball comedy  and made Academy Award history in the process It became the first film to be awarded the top five awards on the night Best Picture Director Actor Actress and Screenplay a feat that remained unequaled until One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  and The Silence of the Lambs  As I watch more of his films Frank Capra is fast becoming one of my most respected directors with such classics as Mr Smith Goes to Washington and Its a Wonderful Life ranking among my favourites of all time This screwball comedy however posed a certain problem since Ive never been a huge fan of the subgenre Whilst I had enjoyed such films as My Man Godfrey and His Girl Friday they hadnt really offered anything other than comedy This means that they did a good job of making us laugh but never really inspired any other emotions  which isnt necessarily a handicap but doesnt appeal to my tastesHappily Im able to announce that It Happened One Night did surpass my expectations and I found it to be a wonderfullyenjoyable very touching romantic comedy The first half had left me feeling a bit uncertain since it reminded me of just about every other s comedy Id seen but then Frank Capra did what Frank Capra does best he put a lot of heart into the film After building towards a perfect fairytale ending Capra suddenly snatches it away slowly but surely stacking the odds against our hero However the director has never been one to leave us with a downbeat ending and when love finally prevails it feels twice as triumphant Of course crucial to the films success are the two lead performers Claudette Colbert and Clarke Gable playing characters of completely polar characters As story runs its course we slowly watch their relationship transform from completely dislike to acceptance to romance and it never feels forced or artificial despite a reportedly tense atmosphere onsetThe plot of the film was based on the story The Night Bus by Samuel Hopkins Adams Ellie Andrews Colbert is the arrogant spoilt heiress of a wealthy father Walter Connolly After she marries the rich but unprincipled King Westley Jameson Thomas against her fathers will Ellie strikes off to New York to be with the man she loves and her desperate father launches a statewide attempt to retrieve her It is on a night bus that Ellie strikes up a frictional relationship with fired journalist Peter Warne Gable whose only initial interest in the stranded girl is a good newspaper story Probably one of the best road movies ever made It Happened One Night also has a few twists in the usual formula which have guaranteed its enduring stature For example Ellies father is revealed not to be an evil overbearing demon but is in fact shown to be a very kind reasonable and loving man who is only trying to guarantee the best for his daughter by ensuring that she marries somebody with principles King Westley later gives up the girl without a fuss compensated by a tidy sum of moneyMuch to my surprise Id never seen a film starring Clarke Gable before but he really was a revelation Never taking any situation too seriously and delivering every line with confidence and a hint of amusement Gable is the laidback everyman that the audience can relate to a stark contrast to Colberts conceited and ungrateful upperclass rich girl My favourite scene took place after the night bus accidentally ran off the road with the shifty passenger Oscar Shapeley Roscoe Karns threatening to reveal Ellies true identity Fearing that his exclusive story could leak into other hands Peter Warne declares himself to be the gangster who kidnapped Ellie threatens to harm Shapeleys family and then chases him into the night Interestingly I followed up my viewing of this film with a  Lux Radio Theater broadcast of the story introduced by Cecille B DeMille and once again starring Gable and Colbert This recording can be found if youre lucky as a special feature on the It Happened One Night DVD and its well worth a listen,8
11,I was inspired to think of other films with completely mystifying titles `The Phantom Menace obviously  Also `The Shop Around the Corner around the corner from WHERE? `The Empire Strikes Back it doesnt `The Living Daylights `True Lies `Batman Forever `Species `The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp  if anyone has any more suggestions please send them to meIn this case it happens over several nights and Im not sure which particular night is being referred to  Probably one of the candidate nights is less unobvious than the rest; so I guess the title isnt COMPLETELY mystifying  But actually Capra gives us the feeling that everything is up in the air  Everyone knows that the hero and heroine of romantic comedies are bound to get hitched in the end  in most cases its simply a question of staying awake  But Capra makes us feel the contingency of it all  I for one was convinced that right up until the final moment it could have gone either way  How did Capra manage this?  Was it because he was a complete innocent; or was it because he was remarkably sophisticated?  I dont suppose it matters its results that countIm glad to see very little mention among the comments about the sexism of it all  The characters have life; their words have life; and if such art as this could only be produced by a sexist society its almost worth creating a sexist society and then dismantling it in order to get the art  In modern romances I get the feeling that the writers are wearily writing `feisty lines for the heroine in an attempt to fool feminists who by and large arent so easily fooled  Claudette Colbert isnt feisty  When she DOES assert her independence she means itAnd of course when Clark Gable asserts his dominance HE means it  You dont get sincerity like this these daysAnyway the ideology of a film if there is one is always beside the point except inasmuch as the ideology is AESTHETICALLY attractive or unattractive This is an attractive film  Two real individuals a real story some misunderstanding but no tiresome or pointless misunderstanding constant wit  and as I expressed amazement at earlier constant suspense  And if THAT isnt enough to get you to watch it note that it was released in   The Hayes code didnt come into effect until   Not a moment too late,10
12,In Miami the spoiled socialite Ellie Andrews Claudette Colbert is trapped in the yacht of her controller father the Wall Street banker Andrews Walter Connolly who has just annulled her secret marriage with the snobbish aviator King Westley Jameson Thomas Out of the blue Ellie jumps overboard and swims to the shore Andrews hires a detective agency to find her and offers a  dollars reward for any information about his daughter But Ellie pawns her watch buys some clothing and a bus ticket to New York to meet her lover She seats side byside with the cynical reporter Peter Warne Clark Gable However when a thief steals her purse with her money in a bus stop and Ellie does not report to the police Peter recognizes and blackmails Ellie asking her to travel together with him He promises to protect her and in return he would write her adventure to meet King Westley Along their journey Ellie falls in love for Peter; but when he vanishes from the motel where they are lodged and contacts her father later she believes he was only interested in the reward In the end love triumphs and the wall of Jericho falls It Happened One Night is another delightful and charming romantic comedy of Frank Capra The romance of a cynical reporter with a spoiled young woman is very funny despite being naive and dated with witty dialogs and the chemistry between Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable is marvelous The cinematography in black and white is wonderful with magnificent use of lighting to highlight the lead couple Last time I saw this classic was on  January  and this is the third time that I watch this film now on DVD from Columbia Distributor and I highly recommend it as one of the best romantic comedies ever My vote is tenTitle Brazil Aconteceu Naquela Noite It Happened that Night,10
13,Capras It Happened One Night is a fascinatingly shot romantic comedy It has the s feel but at the same time I am surprised that such skill was used in the making of this movie during the s The camerawork is brilliant as it brings out both the spatial feel and the crowdiness the long shots are effective and I liked how the scenes change in a sideways flip mode Theres always something about the driving scenes of old classics that amuse me Clearly the background was shot separately and then projected on to a screen during the shooting of the film while in the foreground the actors are just seated in a car pretending to drive While the background scene changes the viewer keeps tuned to the wonderful dialogue between the actors Needless to add the films got fantastic dialogueCapra also brilliantly gives us a glimpse of the s American society especially focusing on gender and class status The difference between the upper class rich people and the common ordinary man is shown by their use of language and their nonverbal behaviour Yet in a way the film is also ahead of its time Ellie isnt just some clichéd damsel of the s She is strongminded stubborn and smart albeit slightly naive She is one who fights for what she wants rather than giving in easily Perhaps this is also one quality of hers that attracts Peter but at the same time their funny quarrels also indicate that there is a an equality in gender status which was something women were struggling with in those daysThe characters are very well etched Peter and Ellie were a lot of fun but I also liked how Alexander Andrews played excellently by Walter Connolly was written as the rich father whos got all the money but all he wants for his daughter is her happiness Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert are great together as they match wits and display warm chemistryIt Happened One Night has become an instant favourite one that I definitely plan to revisit,0
14,IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT Columbia  directed by Frank Capra based on a short story Night Bus by Samuel Hopkins Adams ranks one of the best known and popular romantic comedies from the s thanks to the star chemistry of Clark Gable on loan from MetroGoldwynMayer and Claudette Colbert on loan from Paramount with fine direction by Frank Capra witty screenplay by Robert Risken and for being the very first motion picture to win all five major Academy Awards including Best Actor Gable; Best Actress Colbert; Best Director Capra; Best Screenplay and Best Picture This might have been an upset in  considering other toprated films and performances of the year but who would have imagined IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT to still be as entertaining today as it was back in ?This now wellknown plot thats been remade twice by Columbia as EVE KNEW HER APPLES  with Ann Miller and William Wright; and YOU CANT RUN AWAY FROM IT  with June Allyson and Jack Lemmon opens in a yacht in Miami where Ellen Ellie Andrews Claudette Colbert spoiled daughter of a millionaire Wall Street banker Alexander Andrews Walter Connolly who disapproves of her recent marriage to aviator King Westley Jameson Thomas making arrangements on having it annulled Following a heated argument with her father Ellie runs from her state room jumps overboard and swims to shore Eluding her fathers hired detectives Ellie acquiring new clothes purchases a night bus ticket bound for New York City where she plans to meet Westley While on board Ellen encounters Peter Warne Clark Gable a hotheaded reporter recently fired by his editor Joe Gordon Charles C Wilson With both disliking each other immensely Warne having discovered the spoiled brats identity becomes her constant traveling companion in order to get an exclusive story and his job back Hours before reaching New York and taking a rest stop in an auto camp misunderstandings occur as Ellen awakens to find both Peter and the car goneA simple story playing like an overlong B movie IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a memorable bus trip of so many classic scenes that have been imitated by others but never duplicated Highlights include the Walls of Jericho where Peter and Ellen share a room in auto camps where a blanket is tossed over a rope that separates the couple as they sleep for the night; Peter demonstrating to Ellen on how a man undresses particularly one in which he removes his shirt to no undershirt underneath; Peters correct method of dunking a doughnut into a cup of coffee; and the classic hitchhiking scene where Peter fails to attract cars while Ellen comes up with a method all her ownAlthough IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is essentially a Claudette Colbert movie from start to finish theres no secondary female character quite rare for its time Due to the strength of Gables performance this has been hailed to be his best comedic role Gables character is hotheaded and forceful living by a moral code Although he shares a cabin with a married woman thats all he does He even tells Colberts Ellie when she asks if shell ever see him again he replies I make it a policy not to run around with married women And when hes hungry he takes a carrot from a farm rather than going through the method of panhandling This is Gable a role model Director Frank Capra whose subject matter is usually on people captures the many extras especially those on the bus and auto camps to make them appear as important as leading players Roscoe Karns is equally memorable believe you me! as the gabby bus passenger Oscar Shapeley from Orange New Jersey; Ward Bond as the tough talking bus driver; the meek Arthur Hoyt and the nosy/ domineering Blanche Frederici as the auto camp owners; Georgie Breakston the poor boy traveling on the bus with his mother Claire McDowell; along with other passengers gathered together and singing The Man on the Flying Trapeze to a player of a snoring fat and bald man who rests his head on Colberts shoulder During its entire  minutes theres seldom any underscoring As for the costumes with the exception of the final  minutes both Gable and Colbert use the same clothing through most of their tripWhile Gable and Colbert had challenging roles in their careers plus their reunion in MGMs largescale BOOM TOWN  its amazing how this likable little comedy was the only one to honor them Academy Awards Theres a scene where I feel Gable earned his statuette the one where he tells Ellen the type of girl he would like to someday marry saying that those kind of women dont exist anymore Gable says this with frankness and sincerity Colbert on the other hand earned hers from that same scene as she she listens and looks on lovingly at Gable with tears flowing down her cheek coming to realize it happened one nightIT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT not only became a perennial favorite on late night television during the s and s but on cable TV as well ranging from the Disney Channel s American Movie Classics prior to  to Turner Classic Movies and availability on video cassette and finally DVD While IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT has aged in appearance its still timely screen entertainment Therell never be another film like this again ***/,9

16,A spoiled heiress Claudette Colbert running away from her family is helped by a man Clark Gable who is actually a reporter looking for a storyIn this film a pampered socialite tries to get out from under her fathers thumb and falls in love with a roguish reporter which you know is something that happens when spoiled daughters discover that they want to live like common people and do what common people do like go to supermarketsThe film was the first to win all five major Academy Awards Best Picture Director Actor Actress and Screenplay a feat that would not be matched until One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest  and later by The Silence of the Lambs  And it is not really surprising when you see it besides it is Clark Gable and Frank CapraSo this might not be as outright funny as other films and even as far as screwball comedies go it sort of lags behind The Awful Truth with Cary Grant But Clark Gable has a debonair charm to him from the very beginning he has that attitude about him that women mysteriously love I am a little confused about the laidback approach to marriage and annulment but this is a romance and that is not uncommon if anything it shows how fickle the socialite isOverall a very enjoyable film Not my favorite of the era but well worth a watch or two And heck if such a film can inspire the creation of Bugs Bunny and entertain Joseph Stalin can it be so bad?,8
17,Peter a washed up journalist accidentally bumps into Ellen Andrews a spoiled daughter of a rich guy from whom she ran away on a bus while taking a trip to New York He offers to help her hide from her dad if she agrees to sell her story only to him But on their way to New York they fall in loveThere are many old classic film that are excellent but leave you with a Yeah greatbut I expected something else feeling But It happened one night is one of those films that leaves you amazed without any reservations I was neither a Clark Gable Claudette Colbert or a Frank Capra fan before I saw this road movie which won  Oscars but after I did I became of fan of them for life! The story here is so damn simple that you may at first think that everyone could be able to pull it of but when you think about it you will realize that at the same time its actually very clever carefully written and touching Take this scene for instance Ellen is looking in front of herself while a burglar steals her luggage behind her back She doesnt notice anything but Peter sees this and runs after the burglar Ellen still not turning around is wondering where he is running of to After a while Peter all tired returns and says He got away! And Ellen not knowing whats going on replies I dont know what you are talking about! Thats a perfect example how someone is trying to be a gentleman and ends up as a fool But this is actually a film more touching than funny After a while the spoiled Ellen shows her gentle side and realizes that she loves Peter She says this to her father in tears because she thinks that Peter doesnt love her So incredibly magical and yet so simple Its incredibly high grade of / on the site rottentomatoescom is justified Too bad almost all TV stations are keeping this jewel of air for decades! No wonder my generation is trapped in a vicious circle of violence drugs and alcohol They never got a glimpse of such previous generations with a soul and such raw honest and touching beauty like It happened one night which exceeds the human mindGrade /,10
18,Its a true call that they dont make the movies as they used to There are very less movies coming near to the brilliance of It Happened One Night This movie is about a rich brat running from her home to get married with her lover accompanied with struggling free lancer reporter in her journey And in the journey they fall for each other The romance building between two of them is nicely depicted and the blend of Peter Warne Gables arrogant personality gives it a nice stir The story of the movie is very interesting and the comic attribute added by both Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is sufficed to make anyone laugh The perfect direction from the master of his domain Frank Capra takes the movie on highest level; because of this its the first movie to be honored with all major five Oscars Best Actor Best Actress Best Movie Best Director and Best Screenplay,10
19,It Happened One Night happens to be my personal most favorite film ever It was an adapted screenplay by Robert Riskin from the short story Night Bus and was directed by Frank Capra With a simple story plot modest budget and a very short four week production schedule this film goes a long way Director Frank Capra obviously knew the story to tell and how to tell it Some of the best films are made in a surprisingly short amount of time and on a modest budget This film followed what Capra hoped would be a critical and box office success The hopes were low for this film even after securing stars Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert for the lead roles Columbia Studios was not well respected at the time in HollywoodIt Happened One Night  had a relatively small budget for its time $ of which Claudette Colbert asked for and received $ for her role A star receiving this much of the total film budget was unheard of during the s Released during Americas Great Economic Depression the film had excellent timing and proved to be a big critical and audience hit All the right elements came together It had a high quality comedic screenplay with believable characters in believable situations A film where luck and chemistry came together producing a film that exceeded the expectations of everyone involved including its director Frank CapraThe film comes across as light hearted and natural and with excellent timing and pacing For its time this style of film was new It would be one of the first of a new genre screwball romantic comedy Winner of five Academy Awards in all the major categories Best Picture Director Adapted Screenplay Actor in a Leading Role and Actress in a Leading Role was a first in Hollywood history Only two other films have swept the five top Academy Awards One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest  and The Silence of the Lambs Claudette Colbert was quoted as saying I just finished the worst film ever on It Happened One Night She had no idea how well the film would be edited The film editing here is subtle and sublime Colbert and Gable achieved that rare and special screen chemistry in the film Colberts demand that the film needed to be produced in four weeks because of her vacation schedule actually created the lively pace of the film working in its favor It Happened One Night is a fine example of a quality screenplay some good luck and a lot of chemistry all coming together producing an enduring and enjoyable comedy classicClark Gable comes across as completely natural and very entertaining The fun had while making this film shows partly in Gables performance Unfortunately he would not be cast in a comedic role again even after the big success of this film The studio system of the time demanded stars remain typecasted For Gable that meant macho romantic leading action manTo me It Happened One Night is the best ever romantic comedy film a gold standard for its genre Its lost none of its charm and naturalness since its release in  The look of the film dates it but it still delivers its original naturalness charm wittiness timing pacing and entertainment value Just about a perfectly made film,10
20,It Happened One Night must have put on a smile on Depressionweary audiences way back in  Over  years later the magic still works due to the terrific combination of Gable Colbert and director CapraBut it almost didnt happen at allBoth Gable and Colbert tried desperately to get out of doing IHON In fact it appeared noone in Hollywood wanted the parts of Peter Warne and Ellie Andrews The tiny cashstrapped Columbia Studios was making this film with an untried comedy formula it looked a certain flop Pfft How wrong everyone was IHON swept the Academy Awards taking home all of the Major Awards including Best Actor and Actress Awards for Gable and Colbert It established the screwball comedy genre and the careers of its two stars and director CapraWhy is it so good? Well it has remained so fresh over the years that the laughs beat out almost every modern romantic comedy It doesnt have to rely on smut or toilet humour to satisfy the audience just a classic battle of the sexes we can all relate to Its witty the dialogue is snappy and fastpaced and the acting is near perfect So lets have a closer look at the plot of this gem Spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews Colbert has just defied her father by marrying society aviator King Westley Her angry father wishes to keep Ellie away from her unsuitable husband and whisks her away on his private yacht Daddy hasnt counted on Ellies tenacity and will fed up with the fact her childish hungerstrike is going nowhere she literally jumps overboard When back on dry land she tries to make her way back to her husband by bus trip A series of unfortunate events bring out of work newspaper reporter Peter Warne into her life Cue the battle of the sexes! She has no money so she must accept his help; he knows who she is and to land the biggest scoop of his career he must deceive her whilst also helping her get back to Westley But problems arise when the pair inevitably start to fall in loveThis film is just the tonic that Depression audiences would have soaked up The parodying of the rich is sublime you cant help rooting for Gable who is a fine representative of the underdog It also has its risqué elements that Im surprised got past the Hayes Code that had just been enforced In particular Gables sexy lesson to a shocked yet interested Colbert on how a man undresses and the final breaking down the walls of Jericho scene When Gable undressed to reveal a bare chest with NO undershirt sales dropped off dramatically This would be one of the earliest examples of product placement in filmSome of my favourite scenes the donutdunking lesson the piggyback ride Gable and Colberts mock fight and the justifiably classic Hitchhiking scene Colbert beats the cocky Gable at his own game by proving that SHE doesnt have to use her thumb to pull a ride Instead she shows a bit of leg and stops a vehicle much to the horror of Gable Great stuff!This film almost singlehandedly established the great screwball comedy Colberts Ellie is the ultimate screwy damepaving the way for Lombard and Hepburn in the genre with Gables Peter a direct forerunner to the Fredrich March character in the screwball classic Nothing Sacred  This films holds a very important place in motion picture historyBest of all its so enjoyable/,10
21,The first movie to sweep all the major Academy Awards this film is still popular today Thats probably so because the dialog between the two stars of the picture  Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert  is just great Those two make this fun to watch I enjoyed it however much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect The ending too was very weak Over the last  minutes the two stars go their separate ways until the very end and the story gets very stupidThe nice romance that had developed between the two seemed to have disintegrated when Gable left one early morning for good intentions but didnt tell Colbert The latter thought Gable ran out on her Hollywood in films of the s and s loved to have romances in which confusion abounded and everything was misinterpreted for the worstuntil the happy ending when the truth somehow would surface That same theme was in here along with yet another trivialization of marriage another common theme during the classic era Colbert says it herself in one line mentioning she doesnt care for this other guy but what the heck might as well get married whats the difference? Huh?If the scriptwriters here would have just kept the road part of this film going longer  with Gable and Colbert trading barbs  it would have been super Gable has the best lines an is the most fun to watch but Colbert can hold her own She looks really pixieish and cute although most of her closeups are done with a fuzzy lens another habit of filmmakers of that era had with female stars One of the film worlds most famous scenes is in this movie the hitchhiking scene in which the cocky Cable explains the different ways of successful thumbing in order to get a rideand gets nowhere while Colbert on her first try gets a car to stop immediately after she lifts up her skirt! That is still one of the great comedic scenes in movie historyOverall this is still one of the best comedies of The Golden Age even with its faults,8
22,A cute love story that rivals any of the cookiecutter romantic comedies of today Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert play very well off of each other Sure its cheesy in parts but thats what makes these older movies so much fun,8
23,Its been over eighty years since It Happened One Night debuted on screens and still it remains the quintessential romantic comedy to watch While being the influence of countless films since It Happened One Night is triumphant and timeless because of its great cast director and script At the start of the film we see the beautiful Ellen Andrews Claudette Colbert in Florida aboard her wealthy fathers luxury boat Ellen is planning to marry King Westley but her father disapproves of him and forces her to stay on the boat until he can find someone more suitable to his liking This leads her to run away and seek out Westly herself while her father puts out a highly publicized bounty for her return She boards a bus to New York and crosses paths with the charismatic Peter Warne Clark Gable Hes a gifted newspaper reporter who also has a drinking problem that constantly gets him in trouble Once Warne figures out who Ellen really is he proposes a plan to her He will escort her to New York for the rights to her story which has become a national headline While the seemingly mismatched pair goes on an adventure they eventually warm up and become close The plot flies at a freeflowing pace that allows for wickedly good oneliners The script is fantastic and allows for great comedic timing and also a sense of drama There is a bit of suspense as the willthey wontthey couple explore their feelings for each other While watching the film you get the sense that they will end up together but its never fully guaranteed and leaves room for you to doubt We meet several supporting characters that mostly never overstay their welcomes such as the bumbling Shapeley and boisterous Zeke They are great in the small amount of time they get and dont distract from the main narrative One minor problem with the story is that the geography is very confusing The audience is left out of the loop when it comes to knowing where exactly the leads are This makes it hard to track the importance of each settingThis is the prime example and maybe founding of the screwball comedy Screwball comedies tell the story of two leads often an unmarried man and woman that come from different social classes and how they interact with each other based on their previous lifestyles If you like films such as Heaven Can Wait and Raising Arizona you should thank this film for popularizing the genre Frank Capra won the academy award for Best Director for this film and he totally deserved it He balances his cast well and allows them to have total freedom within the cramped space of the frame He pushes the camera for claustrophobic scenes that force the actors to work together to make the physical comedy work The acting is the definite draw and best part of the film Both Gable and Colbert took home academy awards for their performances Gable will go down as one of the best romantic leads ever Hes handsome quick on his feet and witty He also delivers the perfect oneliners with confidence and swagger to make women want him and men to want to be him Colbert does an excellent job as the uptight and bratty female that so many leading ladies are still trying to replicate almost eighty years later She perfectly embodies a rich girl that is out of her element while in the real world She bounces off Gables laid back working man character with ease and her oneliners are just as good or even better than his Walter Connolly also does a good job as Ellies wealthy father Alexander Andrews He plays the overprotective but also understanding father At first he wants Ellen to marry someone rich and famous in order to boost his social status but after seeing her unhappiness he changes and sees the errors of his ways Hes one of those fathers that every girl wants and every man should strive to be It Happened One Night is the biggest influence on the romantic comedy genre Having the great pair of Gable and Colbert and Capra as the director lifts this film to the heavens of classic cinema Even in  the film is still fun and can be used to teach writers how to create good comedy,7
24,OMG this film so hilarious clever and sweet It has original story and fresh idea about romantic comedy Clark Gable really did excellent job to bring this film more live He is so funny clever and comical Everything that he is doing in this film look so natural and funny Definitely one of Clarks best performance He really deserve an Oscar for his performance Chemistry between he and Claudette Colbert very delightful and cute Just simply romantic Bravo!!!,10
