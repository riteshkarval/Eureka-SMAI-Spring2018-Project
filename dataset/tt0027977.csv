0,Part satire part slapstick comedy part melodrama; the great pioneer of film Charles Chaplin has created his own monument with this film At the same time Modern Times was Chaplins last goodbye to the era of silent film  which remarkably had already ended almost a decade earlierAfter nearly  years this screen marvel still makes me laugh cry  and think about the ongoing automatization of practically every trivial little thing in our lives Modern times indeed To me this film is as entertaining and funny today as I imagine it was then and its certainly as relevant as it was then The tramp still rules My vote  out of Favorite films http//wwwIMDbcom/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesserknown Masterpieces http//wwwimdbcom/list/ls/Favorite LowBudget and BMovies http//wwwimdbcom/list/ls/Favorite TVShows reviewed http//wwwimdbcom/list/ls/,9
1,Charlie Chaplins Modern Times  is the final film to feature the great actor/director/writers most easily recognizable incarnation The Tramp Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film Indeed several iconographic studies have labeled The Tramp with his worn hat distinctive mustache dusty suit cane and trademark waddle as the single most identifiable fictional image in historyStill the film that perhaps most influenced the creation and thematic realization of Modern Times was not even a silent one The Jazz Singer which debuted in  five years before Modern Times began production is perhaps the most important watershed film in the industrys centuryold history In the film comic great Al Jolson stands up in front of the audience andsings And as Millard Mitchell said in Singin in the Rain the public was suddenly in a frenzy for Talking pictures! Talking pictures! Sadly with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue the world of silent filmmaking began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable Nevertheless Chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating City Lights  which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made but by the time Modern Times was released Chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying artModern Times is not an entirely silent film there are dialogue snippets and sound effects but if you look closely every character with dialogue excluding Chaplin himself is being mocked Even when The Tramp opens his mouth the only time he ever did so in a film the words are nonsensical defying the burgeoning convention that dialogue is mandatory for substance entertainment and qualityDespite the films status as one of the greatest comedies of alltime it is hard to ignore the political component In his movies Chaplin often exhibited a great mistrust for authority and progress as often embodied through the social elite the police and wealthy entrepreneurs The irony of the films title then is twofold It connects with Chaplins own bitter feelings regarding his moribund art form but also refers to the plight of the working classes during the Great Depression long working hours with little job security and meager salary while the upper classes remain wealthy and bide their idle time The world was changing fast and Chaplin foresaw that many of these changes were far from beneficialAs we watch The Tramp struggle through the modern mechanized world we laugh at his antics and the absurdity of their results but we can also feel pain and pity He is clearly a man who does not belong Indeed The Tramp can almost be thought of as a misfit who has passed through a membrane from some alternate reality and unwittingly fallen into our familiar world notice that he does not have a name or identification of any kind and as far as we know he has no friends family funds or historyHe takes on assembly lines feeding machines department stores policemen and various other massoriented aspects of the industrialized world all which demand and exhibit sameness and conformity but The Tramp and his symbolic extension the individual never seem to fitThis is consequently why Modern Times is also one of the most poignant love stories ever put on film The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young homeless woman who is referred to as The Gamin and is played by Chaplins thenwife Paulette Goddard These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward despite adversity Both are nameless neither has a home and they each have no money or material possessionsIt is here that Chaplin makes his most poignant and saddening statement about modern living The Tramp and The Gamin are the only characters who exhibit individuality and idealism yet they are also the ones lowest on the social and economic food chain The conclusion of the film which most likely reflects upon Chaplins own emotions is tinged with sadness but also a lingering hopefulness that resonates as loudly and clearly today as it did more than sixty years agoThen there is of course the comedy which is the stuff of legendary status Some of the most memorable comic images in film history are found in Modern Times These include The Tramps bout with an assembly line and his resulting twitches his unfortunate encounter with nosepowder the moment when he quite literally becomes a cog in the wheels of industry and his epic struggle to bring roast duck to an angry customerIn my opinion however the two standout moments are the scene in a department store involving a blindfold and some rollerskates the most exquisite moment of comedy in the film and the sequence where The Tramp is submitted to the mad whim of an outofcontrol feeding machine the most uproarious moment in the filmThese are just a handful of moments that make Modern Times the enduring masterpiece that it is On a personal level the aspect of the film that resonates strongest with me is its appeal to the idealistic misfit in all of us In our hearts many of us long for the simplicity and exuberance with which The Tramp and The Gamin live life with attention to the bare essentials and an absence of need for materialism and modern trappingsAs Chaplin so skillfully shows however our modern times make this lifestyle a faded dream lost among the sheeplike herds of men and women scurrying through a modern metropolis that only Fritz Lang could make seem darker and more devoid of true humanity Still the final image of Modern Times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an everchanging world,10
2,It is difficult to review Chaplins movies objectively because many of us have seen them or at least have heard about them since we were young They have become part of our emotional and/or cultural backgroundChaplin is arguably the only complete director in most of his pictures he also produces acts writes the script composes the music does his own stunts and edits His talent and reputation generated numerous commercial successes even when he continued directing silent movies after their time Talkies were the only films produced after  the few silent attempts afterwards were failures; yet Chaplin was an exception City Lights in  and Modern Times in  were sensations worldwide the latter includes a few sounds but they are marginal This is remarkable since nine years is an eternity in cinema timeframe Only in  did Chaplin direct a talkie*** WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS ***Is the movie a comedy? Partly tragicomedy is Chaplins trademark In my opinion there are three levels of humour Pure amusement sometimes as in slapstick the tramp eats all he can to be sent to jail and even buys more when he is with the policeman; he is drugged in jail; the tramp and the gamin imagine their life in an idyllic house; the tramp rollerskates close to an edge in the department store fabulous stunt; he makes a lousy waiter but a great actor at the end Again I am not certain how much of the fun is derived from childhood memories and/or the fact we feel younger as we watch the film To enjoy it fully we must lay aside some of our adult critical sense notably towards oldfashioned cinema No humour just drama the gamins father dies; her sisters are taken away; the tramp crashes his way through the crowd to get a job an efficient illustration of ruthless competition  Amusement with a dramatic twist these are the most frequent scenes and probably the best We grin even as we laugh The movie opens on sheep moving grouped of which a black one an allusion to the tramp? that fade out to workers coming out of the subway This must have been a shock for the audience during the Great Depression Another example is one of Chaplins most famous scenes ever the tramp tries the eating machine It is at the same time hilarious Chaplin really gives all of himself here and pathetic a metaphor on illconceived progress oppression of man by machine and conditions of workers obliged to comply with strange requestsOther scenes include the entire first part in the factory including when the tramp is stuck in the machine inside shot that became iconic which also happens to a colleague later on outside shot; the tramp launches by mistake an unfinished ship into the sea with footage of an actual ship that was probably sunk because of the Depression; the tramp and the gamin make most of their shabby hutThe movie efficiently alternates these three levels of humour as well as its rhythm It famously starts as a whirlwind with dynamic tempo and music And it ends like a rollercoaster funny musical the tramp sings emotional he is hired dramatic the police arrest the gamin thriller they run away as climatic music plays melancholic they are on the road free but uncertain The last image is rightfully doubleedged the tramp and the gamin walk away but mountains ahead block their road She looks like an elegant lady he looks a bit like a clown with his funny walk and big shoes We dont know where they are going nor do theyHence Chaplins ambition was far more than to just divert Themes depicted eighty years ago are still modern<ul><li>Crisis redundancies strikes inequalities social unrest</li></ul><ul><li>Working conditions in factories even though exaggerated by humour and symbols productivity control burnout</li></ul><ul><li>Technology that dehumanises chainworking the eating machine video surveillance a sciencefiction element at the time Remarkably the only sounds of the film are coming from devices not humans screen phonograph radio</li></ul><ul><li>Success with talent work and some luck</li></ul><ul><li>The law The topic is prominent the police are omnipresent and ambiguous Can one steal food to survive? Chaplin seems to excuse this behaviour The tramp is on both sides of the law he steals food but helps the police arrest villains in jail And the polices role is complex; notably they shoot an unarmed man followed by the ironic card The law takes charge of the orphans</li></ul><ul><li>Violence and drugs in prison</li></ul>The universal dimension of the movie shows by the fact the main characters have no name the tramp the gamin Chaplin will be blamed for its social topics during the McCarthy era among other grievances and he will be forced to exile Considering it now this seems ridiculous since the message of the film is not communist the tramp and the gamin want everything but change society; they search for a job a home and respect Note also Lincolns portrait in the tramps cell he is a patriotThe movie does not take sides Workers can be friendly or violent Policemen can be friendly eg in jail or violent one purposelessly pushes the tramp outside the factory Prison inmates can be honest the tramp or villains Women can be attractive the gamin or not all others actually This doublesidedness also divides individuals Big Bill was bullying the tramp in the factory but later sympathises with him The gamin steals and then becomes settled The tramp will do anything to protect the ones he loves the gamin children but can abuse almost anybody else to achieve it a recurrent feature in Chaplins picturesThe underlying message seems to be people are not good or bad it mainly depends on their conditions Yet another modern theme,10
3,Modern Times is in my top  films and # in my list of favorite comedies Charles Chaplin is arguably the most talented human being nevermind film maker that ever lived I first saw this treasure about  years ago and I watched it again recently to make sure that it really WAS funny and that I had not given it too much praise because it was simply a Chaplin film Modern Times passed my test with flying colors I laughed hysterically from start to finish Each and every scene is innovative well thought out and executed with the genius that only Chaplin possessed Among my favorite scenes are the automatic workerfeeding machine; the jail scene in the cafeteria when The Tramp accidentally sprinkles cocaine on his food thinking it is salt; and the roller skating scene in the department store No special effects or computer animation just pure simple geniusThe storyline in Modern Times is purposefully naive a trick Chaplin used time and again to bring a profound humanitarian quality to his films Watching this film is comparable to watching a Warner Bros cartoon which coming from me is a sincere compliment The level of physical comedy in Modern Times is on par with the masterful short films of Chuck Jones Friz Freleng and othersFinally as was the case with most of his later films Modern Times is a serious social commentary Its message is as relevant today as it was more than sixty years ago when it was released In fact it is arguably even more relevant today and unless the world changes drastically in the future it will continue to be Modern Times is essentially the story of a simple but extremely kind man caught in the traps of industrialized society The opening scene which compares a crowd of workers boarding the subway to a flock of sheep is Chaplins warning against standardization mechanization and other facets of life which rob men and women of their individuality Chaplin always tried to speak for the downtrodden because despite his enormous success and wealth he never forgot where he came from In the end Modern Times is a reminder that no matter how bad things are you can still smile Charles Chaplin has made more people smile than almost any other and his legacy of love and laughter lives on in his films Its up to us to keep his legacy alive,10
4,Favorite Chaplin film Packed with social commentary that is still relevant today Chaplin does a superb job of representing the average worker of the time and the mental impact that the daily motions of what we consider normal in society Such as the opening of the movie in which a scene of a morning rush of people going to work fades into a herd of sheep Chaplin hilarious slapstick comedy is also present in this film while still keeping serious undertones The best example of this is the eating machine This particular scene was a perfect representation of the problems in our society a machine meant to further regiment the day of a worker only to break in the process while also causing a laugh out loud reaction My favorite part of this film is definitely the ending in which Chaplin sings a song and dances What makes this scene so great is not only the fact that it was the first time Chaplin/The Tramp ever spoke but that it was also a stance against talkies Although Chaplin sings the lyrics are complete gibberish but the audience understands regardless All in all I believe Modern Times is Chaplins greatest film this was the first Chaplin film I had ever seen and since then have watched all of them and found a great respect for Chaplin and silent movies overall,10
5,It is a testament to Chaplins filmmaking skills that he is able to impose such significant meaning on what really boils down to little more than a series of comedy skits strung together on an apparently flimsy clothesline of a plot Indeed the cinematic value of Modern Times is unquestionable but it is ironically noteworthy that such a simple and even blocky plot is made into such a memorable film experience and delivers such a strong timetranscending message about poverty stricken populations,10
6,Hilarious touching anarchic revolutionary realist surreal of its time timeless  Modern Times is a multifaceted work of genius When its over and you recall the number of sight gags and magic sequences Chaplin has packed into  minutes it is incredible  the conveyer belt and nut turning; Chaplin caught in the cogwheels; the feeding machine; the Red Flag march; the nose powder; the roller skating ballet; the waiter with tray caught up in the dance my favourite; the gibberish song  and many more Then there is his mixing of silent and sound techniques making the best of both worlds not falling between stools as some directors might have doneOf course there is also a political and social dimension; many of the scenes refer to the impact of technical advances of bureaucracy and of the then current depression on the ordinary little man And it is the little man the individual caught up in societys complex machinery whom Chaplin championed He may have sympathised with leftwing political parties and unions in so far as they supported ordinary working people but Chaplins essential beliefs are enshrined in the final words and shot with him telling Paulette Godard that she should keep smiling they will get along as they walk a couple of individuals into an uncertain future Beyond politics the individual has to rely on his or her own resources and spirit to survive,0
7,This movie is a must see for anyone who loves comedies  Charlie Chaplin is at his alltime best as the Tramp and he has wonderful chemistry with Paulette Goddards Gamin  Together they provide an hour and a half of nonstop laughs  My favorite parts are when he is fed by a modern machine that goes awry and then when Charlie goes crazy in the factory  The situations and expressions are hilarious!  Please see this movie soonyou definitely will not regret it,10
8,Greetings from LithuaniaModern Times  is my first movie which i saw that features Charles Chaplin Saw it first time in  but nevertheless its a great movie Comedy here is truly funny and its not just a comedy It tells a story with some underlying themes that are still kinda topical till this day – technology is changing evolving and if you are not keeping pace with it you will have some hard times like our hero of this movieActing here is very solid actually i was surprised of how well acted this movie was – no one overreacted Story itself is interesting and movie is very well paced – at running time  h  min it almost never drags and is entertaining from start till finishOverall Modern Times is a black and white silent movie there are some sounds actually which safely can be viewed for the first time even in  –  years after its original release It has some truly genuine comedic situations it tells good story and pacing of picture is very solid Maybe it is not possible to review this movie correctly now because its very old but great movies are great movies – they can be viewed no matter what,9
9,Chaplins Modern Times has influenced the th century as much as any other film could have His portrayal of man vs machine individual vs group love vs industryis the framework of classic modern American antiprogressive thinking Gilliams Brazil is the late century equivalent But Chaplin hit it right first insuring generations would have the chance to relate to the challenges of their own modern times,10
10,Long after most people thought the silent movie had been buried forever Chaplin brought his Little Fellow out of mothballs for one more magnificent motion picture The Tramp is trapped in a factory performing mindnumbing repetitive tasks and finally he goes hilariously berserk I started laughing the instant I saw the lady in the dress with the buttons Like City Lights this film is a collection of charming vignettes this time revolving around The Tramps desire to settle down with gamin Paulette Goddard From the Tramps encounter with an assemblyline feeding machine to his unsuccessful stints as night watchman and waiter this movie is packed full of delights Chaplin never speaks but he does sing a little This work of genius can make you smile though your heart is breaking,0
11,Charles Chaplin seemingly had been pushed out of the movie business by the earlys due to the advent of sound a medium that just never seemed right with him Chaplin probably the best filmmaker/performer of the th Century did not despair though He fought back with heart and emotion and by  Modern Times was a major box office and critical success It is a movie that quietly showed a man suffering through a world of change As a factory worker in the film Chaplin tries to cope with the industrial revolution and tries to make it through a quickly changing US economy He finds love with vagrant Paulette Goddard who ended up marrying Chaplin in real life and the two come together and lean on one another in a world of uncertainty and change Modern Times is one of those films that will put a smile on your face but it could make you weep just as easily Chaplins world was changing and not necessarily for the better from his point of view and he wanted to express the variations in his old way of doing things and the new way everyone else had accepted Goddard is also probably the best actress to match Chaplins charm in one of his pictures Their love for one another even though the marriage lasted a relatively short amount of time in real life just seems to shine on the silver screen and they have a chemistry that is sweet and heartwarming Beautifully made wonderfully written perfectly performed smart insightful and always brilliant Modern Times is another film from Chaplin that will brand itself on the souls of all true lovers of the cinema  stars out of ,0
12,This is absolutely the finest film Charlie Chaplin ever madewhich considering the overall quality of his work says a great deal for the quality of the film  Genius is a much overused word but in Chaplins case its use is apt  This is one of the classics of cinema and one of the greatest films ever made!  The scenes in the factory are hilarious You have got to see this film!  Most joyously totally and highly RECOMMENDED!!!!!,10
13,Somehow this very old film is particularly modern today and the exaggerations are not really sooo extreme compared with the real world The humans enslaved by the machines and by those who control them become more and more small and insignificant like the hero of this very funny comedy one of the best in the history that speaks about very ugly things in a very amusing way The Tramp is not a tramp in the beginning He has a real job in a modern factory that almost kills him as the factory becomes more and more modern He becomes a tramp when he stays without a job Picking up red flags in the street can get you in a big problem with the police who are there to serve and protect the rich An honest man can stay honest even in prison and get benefits from this Even a new job But honesty is not really enough Trouble is always around the corner and modern society doesnt permit you to make a new start easilyLove gives you wings or at list hope and the power to continue A beautiful girl of the streets is more than our hero is asking for and he is ready to do whatever necessary Even put his safety in danger to take care of her And she appreciates this In the end when everything is lost once again all they are left with is each other and thats all they really needFor the first time is his cinema career our Tramp will find a girl that will stick with him and support him Chaplin obviously felt with Paulette Goddard something that he didnt feel for his earlier women and I dont blame himAnd this story of modern times like all of Chaplins films will end up with an optimistic feeling in a unhappy end Never is everything lostWith obvious inspiration from Fritz Langs Metropolis and maybe René Clairs À nous la liberté it made the strongest point about THE where we re going in all the cinema of the s I think  and with only Marx bros Duck soup being able to stand anywhere close to it Maybe the most complete funny and mature creation of the best comedian of the seventh art with a lot more than a non stop production line of great jokes to offer If made without a single joke this film would still be one of the greatest of all of our modern times,10
14,Modern Times begins with a shot of sheep going down a runway followed by a shot of workers entering a factory Charlie is set down in the midst of industrial civilization which is dominated by machinery and in which men are organized into mechanical units Capital and Labor Charlies real enemies are no longer the Cop or the Boss with whom he can always enter into some human relation but a vast impersonality invisible and invulnerable Modern Times offered a variety of minor attractions it featured Chaplins wife Paulette Goddard; it had wonderful gags; it indulged in tricks of sound which came to the very edge of being dialog But what did the picture mean what was it trying to say? Because Chaplin charged his usual enormous percentage for it and because of foreign receipts Modern Times made money but exhibitors were not happy at the limited audience turnout For the majority the new Charlie was too serious; for the minority not serious enoughSince the picture seemed to be about the dehumanizing effect of machinery intellectuals called upon Chaplin to join them in reorganizing machine culture to some more human scale of thingsOff the screen Chaplin said nothing On the screen his anarchic hostility for any kind of machine culture expressed itself in scenes like that in which Charlie is fed by a machine and that in which crazed by the assembly line he runs into the street his arms moving convulsively like two pistons Charlie the rebel Charlie the poet Charlie the invincibly human had been turned into a machine,8
15,Modern Times exemplifies Depressionera America; a stream of disappointments tattered dreams and missed chances that attempt to drag the characters down but are defied by the ever buoyant hope of the American DreamScenes from Modern Times aptly capture the mood of America in the late s; men superimposed by sheep shuttled into a waiting line workers being pushed to go faster and faster eventually consumed by the very machine they deigned to control Yet elements of optimism shine through the weary filmChaplin and his gamin dream of a home of their own with cows ready to be milked and steaks crackling on the stove Though their realitya depilated shack Is no Buckingham Palace the two are able to sustain themselves on the American Dream of a more secure fruitful lifeSeveral aspects of the film called to mind a type reality Though  was written in   years after the birth of Modern Times including the large two way screen in the factory allowing the owner to be Big Brother to the workers as well as the police brutality and Ford factory line of men and machineThe film ends appropriately; dusty and bruised from pursuit hardship and hunger Chapin and his orphan girl head of hopefully into the sunset convinced of a better reality awaiting them on the suns return; a hope shared by many in Americas Modern Times,7
16,I saw this as a child and my laughter at the feeding machine scene was so WILD that I have never laughed so hard at anything again in my entire life I literally slid out of my chair to the ground gasping for air The whole film is absurd and brilliant crisply realized by a comedy genius but for me that one moment transcends even greatness and touches the sublime where is poetry and God Seeing the feeding machine again as an adult there are tears mixed with laughter To eat is to live it is the personal realm and the invasion of the authoritarian state into the personal realm is so arrogant and pompous that it frightens me a lot to see how far it has gone as they regulate our speech our food our sex lives according to the latest PC doctrines of nice Chaplin would not have recognized this new world of ours where the working class he represents here is ruled by progressive billionaires spouting inanities,10
17,The hands of the cinema clock were set back five years last night when a funny little man with a microscopic mustache a battered derby hat turned up shoes and a flexible bamboo cane returned to the Broadway screen to resume his place in the affections of the filmgoing public The little man—it scarcely needs be said—is Charlie Chaplin whose Modern Times opening at the Rivoli restores him to a following that has waited patiently burning incense in his temple of comedy during the long years since his last picture was producedThat was five years ago almost to the day City Lights was its name and in it Mr Chaplin refused to talk He still refuses But in Modern Times he has raised the ban against dialogue for other members of the cast raised it but not completely A few sentences here and there excused because they come by television phonograph the radio And once—just once—Mr Chaplin permits himself to be heardThose are the answers to the practical questions They do not tell of Mr Chaplins picture or of Chaplin himself or of the comic feast that he has been preparing for almost two years in the guarded cloister in Hollywood known as the Chaplin studioBut there is no cause for alarm and no reason to delay the verdict further Modern Times has still the same old Charlie the lovable little fellow whose hands and feet eyebrows can beat an irresistible tattoo upon an audiences or hold it still taut beneath the spell of human tragedy A flick of his cane a quirk of a brow an impish lift of his toe and the mood is off; a droop of his mouth a sag of his shoulder a quick blink of his eye and you are his again a companion in suffering Or do you have to be reminded that Chaplin is a master of pantomime? Time has not changed his genius,10
18,The mechanized and standardized world made of levers bolts department stores and lifts is too difficult or probably too ordinary for the honest and trustworthy Charlie Chaplin who always ends up trapped in his times But did this world really change a lot when nowadays we walk to the subway or we drive in crowded streets like cattle in order to reach our working place? In fact what Charlie Chaplin and the beautiful Paulette Goddard a close up of her face after The Little Tramp is arrested for the theft of a loaf of bread is magnificent really wants from modern times is a small decent house where to have dinner together an apple to grab by stretching your arm outside the window and fresh milk from a cow Charlie Chaplin doesnt need to speak on the screen while talking pictures were already widely produced since late s to deliver his brilliant view on s world; and even when he does talk during the floor show towards the end of the movie we dont need to understand what it is said to appreciate once more his talent and genius There are two moments that stand out during the movie the feeding machine that feeds The Little Tramp on the assembly line in the first part of Modern Times note also some similarities later when the mechanic assistant feeds his boss And the splendid final scene when before fading out The Little Tramp invites The Gamin to smile while walking on an empty street at dawn; a scene that alone is worth a full movie a smile that becomes the essence of the use of trying This last moment is full of hope and full of humanity; things that we still struggle for in our modern times,9
19,Modern Times owes a lot to Metropolis despite the difference in tone You can see this especially in the first half with the giant gears and flywheels of the monstrous factory as well as the twoway TV intercom the boss uses to give ordersAlthough there is a lot of serious content  strikes riots poverty police killings  the serious and comic elements blend seamlessly You never get the feeling youre being lectured about anything youre laughing too muchThe element of tragedy lurking in the background makes the comedy that much stronger When Paulette Godard comes into the picture the tone changes from industrial to romantic And it must be said that she is one of the sexiest heroines to appear in an American film more surprising since its a farce Id go so far as to say that Godard outperforms Chaplin in this picture even if her later career was less notableYou have to see this movie before you can understand anything about the art of cinema,10
20,Arguably Charlies best film  Maybe not his funniest but his best because theres so much more to it than the Keystone Kops kind of pratfalls that he so commonly usedFrankly I dont know how the guy did it being so consistently humorous without using any words  All of it depends on a story simple enough to be followed visually and on Chaplins genius for mime and situation construction  There ARE some words spoken on screen  this was his last holdout against talking pictures  but none of them involve people speaking directly to one another  There is a song at the end with gibberish lyrics And the rest of the speaking is always filtered through some mechanical medium a record player a radio a television set  Charlie was accused of communism somewhere along the line and pretty much thrown out of the country after which he lived in Switzerland  You couldnt tell he was a Commie from this movie  It comments on its time of course the Great Depression and Charlie and Paulette Goddard are two poor people  Management is shown as callus playing with a jigsaw puzzle and reading newspapers while the workers slave away on the assembly line  There is even a communist demonstration  But its all played for laughs  One of those red warning flags falls off the back of a truck passing down an empty street  Charlie picks up the flag and waves it shouting after the truck As he begins to hurry after the truck still shouting and waving a horde of dissatisfied workers silently falls in behind him and hes arrested  Poor people steal but they only steal food  If having sympathy for the unemployed is communism then roughly one American out of three was a communist because thats roughly what the unemployment rate was  Modern Times is no more communistic than say My Man Godfrey or Salt of the Earth or The Grapes of Wrath  Besides that Charlie is no classical Marxist  Marxism posited a transition from false consciousness the feeling that ones miserable poverty was due to personal failure or bad luck to class consciousness the realization that exploitation by the property owners was at fault  Charlie is no activist  He fumbles every job he gets  The other workers are hardly sympathetic  Charlies not a working class hero but a black sheep  The opening shot of the herd of sheep hurrying past the camera includes one black sheep in the middle of the flock and its hard to imagine that this was accidentalActually Charlie had lost a lot of respect in America because he had an eye for young girls  His second marriage resulted from a sixteenyearold girls faked pregnancy  Paulette Goddard who became his third wife maybe and maybe not was twenty when this movie was made and Charlie was fortythree  In any case  boy if you want to get Americans heated up just combine sex with politics  A surefire winner for the puritans  It may have cost Goddard the part of Scarlet OHara in Gone With the Wind because she may have been living in sin with Charlie at the timeI dont want to spell out too many of the gags because I dont want to spoil them but be alert for the feeding machine that goes berserk and shoves lug nuts down Charlies throat and hits him in the face with a corn cob Charlie looks as if hes strapped helplessly into his seat but his hands were free under the rotating table so that he could manipulate the fiendish devices himself  The first time I saw this movie was in the Arts Theater on Springfield Avenue in Irvington New Jersey  When Paulette Goddard first appeared the man on my right chuckled and said Now thats a goodlooking babe  On my left my marmorial ex laughed out loud during the feeding machine episode for perhaps the only time in her life  There can be no higher recommendation,0
21,Usually you watch old films trying to be generous with your criticism because of the huge difficulties the directors and actors faced those days This one is a miracle A comedy that stands tall even in todays cinema starring perhaps the best comedian who lived on earth At some parts it is hilarious but the social message Chaplin wants to pass is always there making Modern Times even more important The love story is also very sweet and Paulette Goddard is a remarkably beautiful woman! So what to say about this mans genius? Charlie Chaplin acts directs and even composes the music! And by all means he does a magnificent job You can find great symbolism and a lot of political references we all have to remember that Chaplin was accused of being a communist which of course was a pride for intellectuals given their accusers I have unlimited respect for the Great Charlie Chaplin,9
22,This is where I decided to have a look at Charlie Chaplin and his famous Modern times  we are all familiar with scenes in a factory but honestly there is much much more happening later and it truly surprised me that film turns into a such epic saga Another example of things I just assumed I know It charmed me instantly of course because Chaplin was a true genius and magician  his creation Little Tramp is easily understood to anybody no matter what background and we love him dearly for all his sweetness clumsiness and old heart This story apparently happens in Metropolislike factory where work machines and buttons are parodied mercilessly until we audience roar with laughter  I was honestly surprised that something filmed almost a century ago was still so fresh and funny Basically everything after the first start on the fast track was new to me and I laughed and laughed until I found myself rewinding scenes and enjoying them again What a genius!Once Little Tramp looses his job  there is a whole unspoken atmosphere of unfairness poverty and depression around  he quickly ends up in a prison from which he doesnt even want to leave However he gets Cocaine in his salt Charlie Chaplin on a Coke! saves policemen from escaped criminals meets ministers wife very funny scene and gets release from the prison with job recommendation letter And this is still just a beginning of the movie! There is much much more coming up later  it really goes on forever but its wonderful heartwarming and joyous to watch I almost forgot everything about myself and my whereabouts while I was so deeply lost in this masterpiece Film is so immensely rich with characters stories little details and magic that I honestly think its one of the best things I have ever seen,10
23,The Tramp Charlie Chaplin is just a cog in the modern machinery He is unable to keep with the production line tightening bolts The owner picks him out for testing the automatic feeding machine By late afternoon he gets lost in the machinery He cant stop tightening causing great damage and they send him to a mental hospital He gets out but he doesnt have a job anymore A red flag falls off the back of a truck He picks it and a massive march starts behind him without he knowing it The police grabs him thinking that hes the leader In prison he helps thwart an escape attempt and is released A Gamin Paulette Goddard is stealing food for the children Her unemployed father is shot dead leaving her little sisters sent off to the orphanage She steals a loaf of bread and runs into the Tramp He tries to take the blame but shes caught anyways He prefers life inside and deliberately gets caught stealing They get thrown into the same wagon and escape getting thrown out togetherThis has the iconic factory scene with the Tramp in the machinery happening early on The story is slightly random as the pair has one misadventure after another as they struggle to have the American dream The Tramp is making a statement of sorts as he gets swept up from one thing to the next Hes the cog that never really fits in the machinery This is a sound movie with sound being used for specific and interesting ways The Tramp is actually singing but its a lot of nonsense This definitely has a social commentary but its still funny message movie,9
24,A delightful film with one great scene after another Charlie Chaplins Modern Times is hilarious thoughtful and timeless  Chaplin combined his silent film skills with creative use of sound effects and music and added a wide variety of interesting and entertaining settings to create a film that is very pleasing to watch  Chaplins own fine acting is complemented by a delightful and charming performance by Paulette Goddard  And the story itself filled with twists and turns is a timeless commentary on modern life much of which is applicable to any eraCharlies Tramp character joins up in this one with a lively orphaned gamin Goddard to help each other through a lengthy series of setbacks and triumphs that reflect the stresses of fastpaced modern life  Most of their adventures are hilarious but many also contain serious social commentary that is still just as relevant in any age  Chaplin and Goddard make a delightful pair who win the complete sympathy of the viewer in their fight for survivalThe movie has one great scene after another from some wild sequences in a steel factory to a set of sometimes breathtaking antics in a deserted department store to the incomparable climactic sequence in a cafe and many others in between  The settings are done with great care and wit and the action makes full use of the props and possibilities at handThis is a wonderful movie that anyone who likes vintage cinema will enjoy Even those who are thoroughly jaded by the excesses of modern cinema should at least give Modern Times a try  This is one of the great masterpieces of Chaplins or any other era,0
