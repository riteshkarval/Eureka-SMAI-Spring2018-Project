0,While perhaps not as celebrated now as some of Chaplins later features The Kid is an excellent achievement and a thoroughly enjoyable film Charlie and young Jackie Coogan make an entertaining and unforgettable pair and there is a lot of good slapstick plus a story that moves quickly and makes you want to know what will happen  Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicelyWhile its a fairly simple story this is one of Chaplins most efficiently designed movies  Every scene either is necessary to the plot or is very funny for its own sake or both  Except for Chaplin and Coogan most of the other characters even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance are just there to advance the plot when needed and the two leads are allowed to carry the show which they both do extremely wellThe Kid is also impressive in that while the story is a sentimental one it strikes an ideal balance maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies  Here the careful balance makes the few moments of real emotion all the more effective and memorableThis is one of Chaplins very best movies by any measure  If you enjoy silent comedies dont miss it,0
1,Ive always thought theres a great beauty and poignancy to the best slapstick comedies even unsentimental ones like Keatons The General or Laurel and Hardys Way Out West The latter comedy has a scene where L&amp;H perform a softshoe dance; it always brings me to tears Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that Im laughing doesnt dilute the emotional chargeOne of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already Why not marry the two things? Thats what he did in some of his early short films and thats what he does in this feature comedy The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie Jackie Coogan away Meanwhile the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesnt know if shell ever find out what became of himJackie Coogan about five in this film with his charming manners his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy is one of the alltime great child actors Want more evidence of Chaplins genius? Coogan doesnt steal the film from him This is true even though Chaplin as producer star and director makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boys talents Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles like My Boy and Oliver TwistChaplins storytelling—even with the foolish subDickensian plot twists such as Jackie suddenly taking ill—deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed The windowbreaking scene the flophouse scene the dream sequence the tryingtogetridofthebaby scene—theyre perfect Chaplins celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselvesWant me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know I cant even complain about that Its too sweetly naïve And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the very few flawsOne important note children love this movie Show it to them while theyre young and youll make Chaplin fans of them And thats better than their becoming fans of almost anything thats being peddled to them,0
2,Wow is this a memorable film! It is one of the most famous silent movies ever and justifiably so That fact that it still entertains over  years after it was made is quite a testimony It is a wonderful blend of humor and drama Charlie Chaplins unique humor combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember Chaplins humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stuntsThe kid  Jackie Coogan  is just as memorable maybe even more so He is unbelievably cute especially in those oldtime clothes he wore Watching the expressions on his face even as a baby are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent eraSo between Chaplin and Coogan and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next its an amazing piece of work This is a very fastpaced story which lasts less than an hourThe special edition twodisc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear actually astounding for its age Excellent entertainment,9
3,THE KID First National Pictures  a comedydrama written directed and starring Charlie Chaplin  plays an important part his screen career Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIES PUNCTURED ROMANCE  a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies but releases coming once every two to three years A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in  eventually under the supervision and direction of himself Chaplins methods in movie making improved with each passing film Like himself Jackie Coogan Chaplins littlest costar and title character made such an impression with his initial performance nearly upstaging his impresario that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own becoming Hollywoods first important child starTHE KID starts off with intertitles A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear followed by The woman whose sin was motherhood titles much to the liking of a DW Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish yet in fact might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplins whose very name personifies comedy A young girl Edna Purviance leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father Carl Miller a young artist never returns to her life The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away Crooks enter the scene stealing the car discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else but after stumbling upon a note which reads Please love and care for this orphan child he decides to raise the child himself Five years pass The kid whose name is believed to be John now Charlies adopted son and sidekick start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money As for the kids mother shes become a star of great prominence devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts where lives the kid The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions unaware of each others identities When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention a middleaged country doctor having discovered Charlie not the boys true father sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child awayTHE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product especially for a silent movie made so long ago Chaplin who constructs his gags to perfection has one difficult scene that comes off naturally this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as hes lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot a substitute for a baby bottle back into his mouth Another classic moment on a serious nature is when Charlie is being held back by authorities being forced to watch his crying son taken away from him Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as hes being chased by a policeman from the slanted rooftops The closeup where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on filmChaplin and little Jackie billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin right down to his baggy pants Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances is so convincing that it doesnt take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp From this point onward he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor at the same time adding more plot pathos and truly great comedy routinesAs much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that followsTHE KID which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years was resurrected in the s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in  It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in  as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection double billed along with a comedy short THE IDLE CLASS  In the DVD format the two disc set includes rare outtakes and deleted scenes Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library where it made its debut December   during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights hosted by Robert Osborne and later in March  when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its Star of the MonthFor its age THE KID holds up extremely well thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan Theres no doubt Jackie Coogan  became an overnight star with this one film He was a natural While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again on screen anyway without them there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID ****,10
4,The Kid is a powerfully emotional and wonderfully hilarious motion picture and was a tremendous breakthrough in Charlie Chaplins oeuvre Chaplin hadnt filled a film so fully with pathos since The Vagabond  and then it was in a very limited way subject to the confines of tworeel length Additionally Sunnyside  was a failure The feature length of The Kid also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags pranks and set pieces and with the support of Jackie Coogan its one of his funniest comediesThe parentchild relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment and for me not many have neared Chaplin in exploiting that formula in The Kid The sequence where they take the kid for a workhouse away from the tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the filmor of all film In addition to Chaplin and Coogan Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture Furthermore Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totherohs photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist but the musical score added to the  release composed by Chaplin taken from Tchaikovsky gives the sentimental parts its most verveOf the slapstick one of my favorite scenes involves the tramp in fear of a bully Its reminiscent of his Mutual short Easy Street  which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film Yet The Kid is much more than that which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplins previous work This was the beginning of the tramp as the sympathetic pitiful hero as well as clown thats so recognizable and beloved to this dayMoreover the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect Its also funny in a silly way Its somewhat analogous to the outer reality story although with much ambiguity I wasnt always sure Chaplin was making any clear point such as with the Christ image earlier in the film but that seems unimportant; The Kid affects the emotions and isnt especially aimed at engaging the mind At six reels with more sets and a developed plot this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplins previous films; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth thus making The Kid Chaplins first complete feature,9
5,It is hard to find such delightful and adorable movies these days as The Kid It is a silent movie but so rich winning and beautiful that you don´t nead words Chaplin and year old Coogan are possibly the most charming pair I have ever seen in my life The film succees to be nicely light and full of joy but also overwhelmingly sad and sentimental I always get my eyes full with tears of saddness and happiness And I really never cry in movies And the musicits simply Oscarlevel! The movie is sympathetic full of feeling touchingly funny moments It is truly a masterpiece showing how extraordinary talented person Charlie Chaplin was considering this film is respectively over  years old! So don´t you miss it because of it´s age don´t miss it,10
6,Charlie Chaplin was perhaps the most innovative auteur of the silent era and certainly the most famous His character the Tramp is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early th century but something all of us can overcomeIn one of his first roles with this character he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family Taking himself and this very talented young boy Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote directed starred in and composed the score for this filmHere Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own He hasnt got much but he does have love which is more than can be said for the childs motherFlash forward five years and now the mother wants her son back Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion Even so the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks things not used much at the time in the movies Using these little tricks and ideas Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the storyHowever at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh sometimes in the same scene This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it,8
7,Is there a way to name the greatest filmmaker of all time? Probably not to different people its gonna be different person so I can speak only for myself Let me try to describe my favorite contestant for this award,0
8,Its easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius but Ill say it once again the man was a genius if only at doing a certain particular kind of film You wouldnt ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film or at least one like out of Germany or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the s and s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and the usual kickedaround word manipulated amid the comedic setups Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the KidAs it stands even at  minutes which was trimmed by Chaplin himself  years after its original release and including a new musical score its just about a perfectly told tale It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that Dreamland sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful lightanddark examination of all the major characters in the picture now with angel wings and devil horns! What its about in complete basics is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she wont be able to take care of him and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at and the Tramp decides to take care of him he even names him in one amusing aside John Then it cuts to  years later and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows eat lots of pancake and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an Older Brother of a kid John gets in a fight with Meanwhile the mother is now a success not knowing her child is somewhere right in front of her noseThis may sound like a bit of story but its told briskly and without a missed beat in editing and Chaplins reedit tightens it to a point where were mostly with the Kid and the Tramp Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be playful absurd cute and bittersweet to a degree We know this cant exactly last but the moment the poor maybesick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic and yet partially triumphant sequences in the movies Its in a case like this where we as the audience tear up more or less as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out and then intercut with Chaplins daring dash across the rooftops to save him that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film silent or otherwise; that its silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true even a beat with the Kid playing with toys an obviously cute bit is great and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like ChaplinFeaturing some excellent setpieces just unto themselves aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that bellylaugh part with the repetitive brickhit to the head or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin and excellent performances from all supporting cast including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance its altogether an aweinspiring feat To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness,10
9,Charlie Chaplins study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid the cute little Jackie Coogan has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos and true to what you would expect of his best work does it superbly  The tramp always manages to wring the hearts of his viewers and adding a little boy to the mix was the finishing touch  Look out too for little Lita Grey in the angel sequence who would become Chaplins nd wife four years after this film was made,0
10,What makes a feature film different to a short? It isnt just length After all some of Charlie Chaplins later shorts were as long as fortyfive minutes while The Kid is barely an hour No when Chaplin made his graduation to fulllength features he also strove to broaden the scope scale and above all the dignity of his work The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplins careerThe Kid begins with a bit of backstory as a few of Chaplins shorts do but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this Here we have the opening of a drama and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief Of course such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short but here that wouldnt be appropriate Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters – they are by no means laughoutloud funny but they certainly dont belong in a straight dramatic setting And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room sceneAnd never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration but still very natural by the standards of the time And of course little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive his movements expressions and timings all spoton so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness and he appears more like a human cartoon character Coogan steals the picture with ease and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously asideThis too is an important difference with The Kid Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act famously severing his partnership with the funnyinhisownright Ben Turpin back in  Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own The few examples such as the routine with the policemans wife and the window ledge are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material However he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this outToday The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful featurelength spinoff If you look at something like the minute Christmas special of The Office it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements and has become recognised as a masterpiece – better than the series By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode Chaplins full length features however were far more than just spinoffs and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work,9
11,The Kid became a critically hailed international hit A tramp Charles Chaplin brings up an abandoned baby Jackie Coogan and later loses him to his mother Edna Purviance; but there is a happy endingThe film is a sentimental silent comedy set in the slums The comedy is sparingly laid on but the overall effect is much less painful than the synopsis would suggest The production is comparatively smooth young Coogan is sensational and the film contains much of the quintessential Chaplin Chaplin had difficulties getting The Kid produced His inspiration it is suggested was the death of his own first son Norman Spencer Chaplin a few days after birth in ,10
12,Charlie Chaplins first full length feature film and his biggest success up to that date is a remarkably heartwarming story  which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy It begins with a woman whos sin was motherhood who gives birth to a baby she cant support at a Charity Hospital which is kept padlocked from the inside She is forced to abandon it in an alley and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film as he is casually strolling by and then through a series of odd but entirely believable situations he is unable to get rid of it It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin who was in top form playing the little boy at  years old Charlies life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplins traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed dramatic story The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments sometimes simultaneously if you can believe that but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival and it is never once predictable all the way until the last frameThere is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy and in between rounds  Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well and giving him hints for the rest of the fight Meanwhile the other kids brother shows up a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankensteins monster than anything else What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street This is a slapstick setup that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time were it not for its direct relevance to the storyAt another point there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home as the  version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackies arms I think this is the only time in any film that Ive ever seen genuine lowbrow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident This combination not just here but throughout the film is The Kids biggest achievement There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about although my understanding is that volumes have been written about its symbolic meaning both within the movie and in reference to Chaplins personal life And speaking of which supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing I dont know which story to believe that it was because of Chaplins painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary I would bet its a little of both but the film is here and I guess ultimately thats all that matters In the five or six times that Ive seen The Kid I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramps real son either on screen or off Then again I am looking at it with st century eyes Some of Shirley Temples early films are also a little disturbing to me although for not quite the same reasons By this time Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films and after  short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond along with a few assorted others Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema,10
13,Wonderful picture mixes sentiment  drama  slapstick and pursuits in a winning combination  While walking the slums the Tramp Charles Chaplin meets a baby left by an unfortunate woman Edna Purviance who played several Chaplin films  including a note  ¨Please love and care for this orphan child¨  He then cares for an abandoned child  as Charlie struggling to nurture the castoff illegitimate kid Jackie Coogan who launched as the first child superstar  The Tramp has to face nasty cops  doctors and orphanage workers who want to carry the kid to County Orphan Asylum  As events put that relationship in jeopardy This sassy picture packs slapstick  interweaving gags  melodrama  opulent Victorian sensibility and a lot of laughters are guaranteed too  ¨The Kid¨ is a culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant drama that originated a great influence of wide range  Ordinary sentimentality is made available both by the balancing presence of harsh reality and Chaplins amusing grace of pantomimic skills  The sensitive drama is set amongst garbages  flophouses  a slum world described in Erich Von Stroheim style  Being accompanied by an adequate soundtrack  as the main theme from Charles Chaplins score is based on a theme from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovskys th Symphony  Duo starring is frankly magnificent  As Charlots marvelous acting as a tramp who takes home an abandoned baby  Nice acting by Jackie Cooper as streetwise orphan that launched him as major child star  and its easy to see why  Furthermore  agreeable Edna Purviance as unlucky mother  she acted in a lot of Chaplin shorts and in A Woman of Paris A Drama of Fate The motion picture was masterfully directed and played by Charles Chaplin  The production company tried to cheat Charles Chaplin by paying him for this sixreel film what they would ordinarily pay him for tworeel film about half a million dollars Chaplin took the unassembled film out of state until they agreed to the oneandahalf million he deserved plus half the surplus profits on rentals plus reversion of the film to him after five years on the rental market Deemed to be Chaplins first real feature but he had made many shorts such as ¨The Vagabond¨ ¨Night at the show¨ ¨Burlesque on Carmen¨ ¨The immigrant¨ and ¨The circus¨  Chaplin subsequently would make a string of successful films such as ¨The Gold Rush¨ ¨City lights¨ ¨Modern times¨ ¨The great dictator¨ ¨Monsieur Verdoux¨  ¨A King of New York¨ and his last movie ¨Countess from Hong Kong¨,8
14,The simple lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch Id say that it is as much funny as sad and the music score couldnt be more accuratePerhaps the most delightful surprise was to In the dreamland scene So full of symbolism and lyrically narrated the scene made me question myself if at the moment I was watching Buñuel and not Chaplin It is not my Chaplins favorite but its for sure one of his bests Totally recommend to be watched Chaplin will never disappoint you thats for sure If you watch this one also with City Lights and Modern Times youll be ready to enjoy his talkies The Great Dictator a classic and the perfect touching till tears Limelight,9
15,Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five yearsIn reading Charlie Chaplins memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid First he had to get child star Jackie Coogan away from Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle under whom the lad was contracted Chaplin saw him and was determined to make a film with him The second thing was Chaplins determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be doneThe success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they dont totally steal the film from youThe Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid Hes the same rapscallion Tramp we all know but The Kid showed another side of The Tramp one of deep feeling and protectiveness Two people who need and love each other very much This film couldnt missFirst National Pictures sure thought so as it became part of a three way tug of war between Chaplin the studio and his estranged wife Mildred Harris The Robert Downey Jr biographical film Chaplin illustrates that whole bit of business where Charlie smuggled out the negative of The Kid and took it on the lam across state lines He edited it and was able to get it back to First National as a finished product on his own terms That whole business probably would make a good movie unto itselfTill that one is made see and enjoy the Tramp and the future Uncle Fester in The Kid,9
16,The Kid was released in  at the pinnacle of the Silent era when emotions came to screen through looks and body language when we didnt need dialog we had faces And if theres one film where Charlie Chaplins face oddly illuminates the screen its definitely The Kid Sure many fans would argue that City Lights is Chaplins masterpiece but something is too perfect too masterfully directed it was made during the talking era Chaplin was in his s and had more experience while The Kid features a more youthful director It belongs to a whole other era and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics  Indeed in  Chaplin was  Hitchcock  Brando wasnt even born discovering The Kid is like turning the pages of a dusty yellowpaged historical book one eye is watching the film while the other discovers a period And I dont know if Im the only one but theres something in the setting the location that makes the film look even older For all I saw the movie could have been set in the early century and considering the timing of the film maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin himself The film was made in a difficult personal time when hed just lost his son after his birth There was a great wound in Chaplins heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragementThe context of The Kid is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time which is even more impressive considering his sevenyear experience a short time but enough to create an icon the Little Tramp an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema Chaplins story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and Im sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame  and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a filmmakerThe Emigrant in  was like the first step back into Chaplins past inspired by his own experience The movie doesnt feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future and leaving the motherland wasnt synonym of sadness but the emotions were there beyond the slapstick and the comedy and waiting for another step back to finally explode in an emotional firework which directly transports us to Chaplins past He who grew up without a father and started working at an early age he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living before it cemented his talent he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin And this is how The Kid was made and for the first time Chaplin would become more than a simple clown and get all the respect he needed from his peers as a gifted filmmaker He could finally make his first masterpiece The Gold Rush but The Kid was this necessary last breath before taking the big diveMany aspects of The Kid highlight Chaplins past and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs  a woman abandons a child expecting him to be adopted by a rich family until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramps arms But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who despite the archetypal situations didnt make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt as is the father a nicelooking fellow and a sign that Chaplin doesnt hold any grief against his father These things happen and we shouldnt feel sorry as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos  the Tramp and the KidIn every aspect the Kid is Chaplins alter ego  hes smart tender funny sensitive and more than anything extremely convincing Weve seen so many child performances since  to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is and Jackie Coogan is one of the best if not the best almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy and that the kid didnt become as much a star as Chaplin is one of cinemas cruelest ironies The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense closeups on Chaplins face  his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen and whatever inhabits the Tramps heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himselfChaplin like Disney for animation handled drama with the same strength as for comedy the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy fun cheers and even some dreamy escapism allowing a selfreflexive approach of the magic of childhood The Kid is not perfect but its a masterpiece of sincerity of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music If not his best its his most defining film ,9
17,This is such a incredible movieAlong with City Lights and The Gold Rush this has to be one of the best movies starring Charles Chaplin and it is also one of the best movies ever madeIt is true that for the modern viewers the story of this film could be way too melodramatic and dated but personally I think it is one of the most heartwarming and captivating films ever made and a timeless classic from the age where movies were made with heart and not only thinking only in the boxofficeThat doesnt mean this movie isnt entertaining In fact I found this movie to be way more enjoyable than many modern unfunny comedies and also way more emotional and engagingI truly loved this film It is one of the best movies of the story of cinema and shouldnt be forgotten,10
18,The opening title to this film reads A film with a smile  and perhaps a tear Truer words about a motion picture have never been spoken for Charlie Chaplins The Kid has a plethora of smiles from start to finish and yes a few tears as well The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character played by Chaplin The Tramp takes the baby into his own care Five years go by and the Tramp and the Kid portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan are getting along just fine However a turn of events results in the two being separated and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his sonCharlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking and this film is one of his best His direction is truly remarkable being able to manipulate the audiences emotions so much without sound He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget He manages to make you laugh almost nonstop from start to finish and even wind up causing you to shed a tear Its so emotionally gripping and you just fall in love with these characters from the getgo Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinemaAs emotionally wrenching this film is its simply hilarious This film has some great slapstick humor and Chaplin is a true master of it Jackie Coogan is also great If I had to find one flaw with the film it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I dont really mind it despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film Overall The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute then tug at your heartstrings the next Its an absolute riot but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema Ive ever seen And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue its just incredible And not to mention the music is just stellar too Chaplin is a master at composition The Kid is one of my favorite films and anyone who has yet to see it should definitely get on that!,10
19,When watching this I wanted to give the film a  rather than an  simply because I do not think it is as good as Modern Times or one or two others However taking into account that this is  and the film technology is not all there I will give it a little extra bump because it is so clean and well done it could have been made a decade later and looked the sameChaplin has to of course be given a lot of credit for producing writing directing and starring Being a great comic actor is one thing but being able to run your whole production takes a special skill And young Jackie Coogan sells the picture The film succeeds or fails depending on your casting of the kid and they nailed it  hes adorable emotional and seems able to handle any situation,8
20,The worlds most famous tramp is back and this time he has kid sidekick! Sounds kind of gimmicky right? But it works perfectly! Chaplin and child actor Jackie Coogan work extremely well together Their scenes are filled with heart and you can see that they both enjoyed themselves during the making of the movie The movie has the signature Chaplin slapstick that is guaranteed to have you in stitches but it also has some genuinely sad and emotional moments making this movie one of Chaplins most fondly remembered from his gigantic and legendary filmography,10
21,A tramp finds an abandoned kid on the street He tries to get rid of it in Charlie Chaplin way but ends up raising it with road side values Child becomes an apple of his eyes in a few years but the mother comes back to claim her son I had heard that this was the best movie Charlie Chaplin made but I disagree with that statement completely No doubt its a fantastic movie with a very strong story and message but its definitely not his best I found the last scene of the movie a little contrite and compromising The story has been adapted and tried in very many forms Extremely sensitive and though provoking cinema A must see for all,8
22,I was hardly a Chaplin fan in fact I loved Laurel &amp; Hardy and really didnt like Charlie Chaplin until I found that I could impersonate him as a lookalike  Then while viewing his films for the need of impersonating I have become a big Charlie Chaplin fan  His comedy mingled with pasos and pantomime was unique and very funny; and this one is certainly one of his bestIn it a sixyear old Jackie Coogan makes his screen debut as a little orphan that the tramp picks up and cares for five years  Every moment of this film is terrific it moves along swiftly and made me shed a tear three or few times  Chaplins score is undeniably a great piece of artwork and the acting is superb; nobody in this film lacksespecially ChaplinI recommend this film for all to see  Its age has not diminished this little love tale for a family in fact it makes you realize family love even more  Youll laugh cry and have a great time out  Rent it  Buy it View it  Its a film for all to see,0
23,They say Chaplain is a cultural icon and all that but Im not so sure anymore There has been a generational discontinuity at least in the USA that seems to have happened about  or  years ago I suspect that most people over the age of  could identify Charlie Chaplin and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinctionGenerally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation but Jackie Coogan is an exceptionSentimental manipulation there is but its mainly limited to one or two scenes The comedy is pretty acerbic Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again Thats not what passes for sentimentalityBesides Coogan is cute when hes  or  years old a ragamuffin dressed in floppy oversized bags of clothing so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it And the kid can act tooCharlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him which was all he had to do Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because hes too inexperienced to know how to overact Chaplain is good too of course How could one person be so inventive? Its said that TV eats up talent because of the constant demand for new material One of the better series Twilight Zone had about three good years of collaborative effort in it Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in  films and directed something like  of them and he was just getting startedIll give one example of a joke without an iota of sentiment in it to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid a big bully who knocks him about Chaplain spots this interrupts the fight and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing  go for the belly keep your guard up  and sends him back into the fight At this point the bullys hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says If your boy beats my boy Im going to beat you Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bullys chin and flattens him But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back Chaplain dashes over puts his foot on the Coogans chest to hold him down quickly counts to ten rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand  the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy Youll enjoy it Especially if youre one of those rare folks under  with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue,0
24,A picture with a smile and perhaps a tearThat is the first line of the movie as it begins and it stands true We cry when the kid is being taken away from his father and we smile when they unite and share the feeling Wow I cant say ho much this meant to me as a father and son story Now we have got so many movie where a child is taken away and united finally recent great movie is Finding Nemo But whats special about this movie is simplicty honesty and a rare kind of emotion that only Chaplin could bring into usDone by the genius Chaplin there is not a moment where we are left without a feeling we either smile or bring tears So to say there is never a dull moment would still be an understatement Look for that dream scene and most of the things that we wish to do are done there Winning over a fight from a neighbour meeting angels and all Now look at the editing in this less than an hour film its neat and precise The cinematography tells us the story superbly by moving camera at right pace The music supplements at most places and yes it is great music in the context of the film Acting is sublime by Chaplin only few can do what he did and even today hardly anyone can match him Its a great movie undoubtedly and a must watch atlas watch it before you die you may learn something you never wanted to miss Its / for one of the finest silent movies ever,10
